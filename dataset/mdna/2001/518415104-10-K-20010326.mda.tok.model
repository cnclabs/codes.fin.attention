item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in the section entitled factors affecting future results and elsewhere in this report 
lattice semiconductor corporation designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic devices  or plds  and related software 
programmable logic devices are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and enable the end customer to shorten design cycle times and reduce development costs 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the markets of data communications and telecommunications  as well as computing  industrial and military systems 
in  we acquired vantis corporation  the programmable logic device subsidiary of advanced micro devices 
this acquisition has increased our share of the pld market  accelerated development of new products and technologies and expanded our penetration into new and existing customers 
as indicated in our consolidated financial statements  is a twelve month fiscal period  as compared to the nine month fiscal period and twelve month fiscal year results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue represented by selected items reflected in our consolidated statement of operations year ended dec

as discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements  we completed the acquisition of vantis corporation vantis from amd on june  we paid approximately million in cash for all of the outstanding capital stock of vantis  plus million in direct acquisition costs  million of accrued pre acquistion contingencies  million of accrued exit costs  and assumed certain liabilities of million related to the vantis business 
in addition  we exchanged lattice stock options for all of the outstanding stock options under the former vantis employee stock plans with a calculated black scholes value of million 
the total purchase price for vantis was million 
the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an independent appraisal and management estimates 
in process research and development ipr d costs were appraised at million at the acquisition date using a methodology consistent with current views of the staff of the sec 
these ipr d costs were charged to operations on the acquisition date 
remaining intangible asset costs of million  at the acquisition date  are being amortized to operations over five years using the straight line method 
the purchase was financed using a combination of cash reserves and a new credit facility bearing interest at adjustable rates 
the new credit facility was replaced with convertible notes in november see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have taken certain actions to integrate the vantis operations and  in certain instances  to consolidate duplicative operations 
revenue 
revenue was million in  an increase of from fiscal period fiscal period revenue of million represented an increase of from the million recorded in fiscal year in addition to our acquisition of vantis  this increase in revenue is primarily attributable to increased sales of high density products  particularly our new volt high density products  in all geographic regions 
revenue from the sale of high density products represented  and of total revenue for  fiscal period and fiscal year  respectively 
additionally  was a twelve month fiscal period  as opposed to the nine month fiscal period fiscal period revenue  when compared to fiscal year revenue  was positively impacted by increased demand from asia in conjunction with that region s economic recovery 
our sales by major geographic region were as follows year ended dec 
 nine months ended dec 
 year ended mar 
 in thousands united states    export sales europe    asia    other    revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was approximately for  for fiscal period and for fiscal year we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue 
the average selling price of our products increased in as compared to fiscal period  but decreased slightly in fiscal period as compared to fiscal year this fluctuation in overall average selling price is due primarily to product mix changes and increased sales of high density products 
although selling prices of mature products generally decline over time  this decline is at times offset by higher selling prices of new products 
our ability to maintain or increase the level of our average selling price is dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of new products 
see factors affecting future results 
in march  we announced that we expected a significant sequential decline in revenue in the first quarter of we believe this shortfall is the result of a general decline in pld consumption within the communications and computing end markets 
the extent of this decline and whether this decline will continue or accelerate is not known at this time 
gross margin 
our gross margin was for  for fiscal period and for fiscal year the gross margin improvement in as compared to fiscal period is primarily due to continued reductions in our manufacturing costs and improvements in our product mix 
the gross margin decline in fiscal period as compared to fiscal year is attributable to our acquisition of vantis 
the decline was partially offset by an improvement in product mix and reductions in our manufacturing costs 
reductions in manufacturing costs resulted primarily from yield improvements  migration of products to more advanced technologies and smaller die sizes 
research and development 
research and development expense was million in  million in fiscal period and million in fiscal year in addition to our acquisition of vantis  spending increases resulted primarily from the increased development of new products 
additionally  was a twelve month fiscal period  as opposed to the nine month fiscal period we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership in our existing product families and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in  million in fiscal period and million in fiscal year increased expenses were primarily due to increased variable costs associated with higher revenue levels and our vantis acquisition 
additionally  was a twelve month fiscal period  as opposed to the nine month fiscal period in process research and development 
in process research and development costs of approximately million were incurred on june  in connection with our acquisition of vantis  and are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets acquired in the vantis acquisition was million in and million for fiscal period the increase in amortization for as compared to was primarily due to a full year of amortization in as opposed to approximately months june  acquisition date through december  in fiscal period the estimated weighted average useful life of the intangible assets for current technology  assembled workforce  customer lists  trademarks  patents and residual goodwill  created as a result of the acquisition  is approximately five years 
gain on appreciation of foundry investments 
this gain on appreciation of foundry investments in was recorded on january  it represents appreciation of equity investments made in two taiwanese companies  uicc and utek  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income was million in  an increase of as compared to fiscal period this increase was attributable to increased cash balances generated from our follow on stock offering  completed in july  a twelve month fiscal period in as opposed to the nine month fiscal period  and cash generated from operations and exercises of stock options 
fiscal period interest income was million  a decrease of as compared to fiscal year this resulted primarily from lower cash and investment balances in conjunction with our vantis acquisition  and a nine month fiscal period as compared to the twelve month fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in  an increase of as compared to fiscal period substantially all interest expense resulted from the debt issued to partially fund our vantis acquisition 
acquisition related debt was outstanding for all of  but only for six and one half months in fiscal period provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in  as compared to a benefit for income taxes of for fiscal period and a effective tax rate for fiscal year the benefit for income taxes for fiscal period was attributable to the tax effect of the in process research and development recognized in conjunction with our vantis acquisition 
the effective tax rates for and fiscal year were lower than the statutory rate primarily because of tax exempt investment income and tax credits 
extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
the extraordinary item  net of income taxes  in fiscal period represents the writeoff of unamortized loan fees related to the credit facility repaid in conjunction with the re financing of our acquisition of vantis 
factors affecting future results notwithstanding any objectives  projections  estimates and other forward looking statements contained in this annual report  our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based on a wide variety of risks 
the following risks  and potentially other risks  may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue and profit levels during industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less dynamic or less technology driven industries 
currently  the industry is undergoing a cyclical downturn 
in the past  our financial performance has been negatively affected by significant downturns in the semiconductor industry as a result of the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
when these or other conditions in the semiconductor industry occur  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling new products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
our future success depends on our ability to introduce new or improved products that meet customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
if we fail to introduce these new products in a timely manner or these products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
the introduction of new products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long term market demand and future technology developments 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new product families and the continued market acceptance of our software development tools 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  excessive inventory accumulation by our end customers  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the new fabs of seiko epson  umc or at other foundries  changes in manufacturing yields  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
as a result of these factors  our past financial results are not necessarily a good predictor of our future results 
our stock price may continue to experience large short term fluctuations 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe and have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies 
our wafer supply may be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers 
currently  all of our silicon wafers are manufactured by seiko epson in japan  amd in the united states and umc in taiwan 
if seiko epson  through its us affiliate epson electronics america  amd or umc significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of seiko epson  epson electronics america  amd or umc were to reduce its supply commitment or increases its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of seiko epson s  amd s or umc s foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use larger wafer sizes and smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundries 
because we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced e cmos process technologies at the new fabs of seiko epson  umc or future foundries may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we depend on our foundries to deliver reliable silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundries are unable to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  for a prolonged period  our operating results could be harmed 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from products based on a specialized silicon wafer manufacturing process technology called e cmos 
the reliable manufacture of high performance e cmos semiconductor wafers is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and the circuit designer 
as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
if our assembly and test subcontractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we rely on subcontractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in lead frames used to attach semiconductor devices to the package  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly subcontractor and the device manufacturer 
as a result  our subcontractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
deterioration of conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
two of our three silicon wafer suppliers operate fabs located in asia 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors located in hong kong  malaysia  the philippines  south korea  taiwan and thailand 
a prolonged interruption in our supply from any of these subcontractors could harm our operating results 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
our wafer purchases from seiko epson are denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the dollar with respect to the yen fluctuates 
substantial deterioration of dollar yen exchange rates could harm our operating results 
export sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
our export sales are affected by unique risks frequently associated with foreign economies including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
for example  our export sales have historically been affected by regional economic crises 
significant changes in the economic climate in the foreign countries where we derive our export sales could harm our operating results 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase as our market expands 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our products and technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products and solutions based on alternative technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
we also may experience significant competition from foreign companies in the future 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may utilize substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may also be subject to future intellectual property claims or judgements 
if these were to occur  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms or without our operating results being adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and short term investments  an increase of million from the balance of million at december  this increase was primarily due to the generation of approximately million in net proceeds from our follow on stock offering in july  as well as cash generated from operations and exercises of stock options 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase in working capital was primarily due to the increase in cash and short term investments 
during  we generated approximately million of cash and cash equivalents from our operations compared with million during the nine months of fiscal period accounts receivable at december  increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december  this increase was primarily due to increased product shipments and revenue levels in comparison to fiscal period inventories increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december  primarily due to increased production in response to the higher revenue levels 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by million  or as compared to the balance at december   primarily due to a million increase in the current portion of wafer supply advances 
current deferred income taxes increased million  or  as compared to the balance at december   primarily due to the increase in deferred income for sales to distributors which is recognized currently for income tax purposes  and to a lesser extent the timing of deductions for certain expenses and allowances 
foundry investments increased by million  or approximately  as compared to the balance at december  this was primarily due to the million after tax gain recorded in the first quarter of representing the appreciation of our foundry investments  offset by a million unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive loss on the unrestricted portion of these investments due to subsequent market depreciation 
net property and equipment increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december  primarily due to capital expenditures 
intangible assets  net  decreased by million  or as compared to the balance at december  due primarily to goodwill and other intangibles amortization 
net non current deferred tax assets decreased million versus the balance at december  this decrease was primarily due to the following factors a million increase in non current deferred tax assets due to timing differences between book and tax recognition of future income tax benefits to be derived from the amortization of intangible assets and the ipr d charges  an increase in non current deferred tax liabilities of million recorded in conjunction with the gain and subsequent unrealized loss recorded on our foundry investments as discussed above  and other timing differences between book and tax recognition of future income tax benefits 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december  due primarily to liquidation of liabilities recorded in conjunction with our acquisition of vantis in june deferred income increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at december   due primarily to increased billings to distributors associated with higher revenue levels in on october   we issued million in convertible subordinated notes due on november  these notes require that we pay interest semi annually on may and november holders of these notes may convert them into shares of our common stock at any time on or before november   at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
beginning on november  and ending on october   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a redemption price of of the principal amount 
in the subsequent three twelve month periods  the redemption price declines to  and of principal  respectively 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness  and are subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no senior indebtedness and our subsidiaries had million of other liabilities 
issuance costs relative to the convertible subordinated notes are included in other assets and aggregated approximately million and are being amortized to expense over the life of the notes 
accumulated amortization amounted to approximately million at december  on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders and abn amro bank nv abn amro as administrative agent for the lender group 
the credit agreement consisted of two credit facilities a million unsecured revolving credit facility revolver  and a million unsecured reducing term loan term loan  both expiring and due on june  on june   we borrowed million under the term loan and approximately million under the revolver 
the million revolver was repaid in full during the third calendar quarter of in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes  we repaid the million term loan in full during the fourth calendar quarter of fiscal remaining unamortized loan fees at the time of repayment  aggregating approximately million million net of income taxes or a charge of for basic and diluted earnings per share  were written off and are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as an extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million for  fiscal period  and fiscal year  respectively 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for the fiscal year ending december  in march  we entered into an advance payment production agreement with seiko epson and its affiliated us distributor  epson electronics america  under which we agreed to advance approximately million  payable upon completion of specific milestones  to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron wafer manufacturing facility 
under the terms of the agreement  the advance is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
the agreement calls for wafers to be supplied by seiko epson through epson electronics america  pursuant to purchase agreements with epson electronics america 
payments of approximately million have been made under this agreement 
in  we entered into a series of agreements with umc  pursuant to which we agreed to join umc and several other companies to form a separate taiwanese company  uicc  for the purpose of building and operating an advanced semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
under the terms of the agreements  we invested approximately million for an approximate equity interest in uicc and the right to receive a percentage of the facility s wafer production at market prices 
in  we entered into an agreement with utek  a public taiwanese company in the wafer foundry business that became affiliated with the umc group in  pursuant to which we agreed to make a series of equity investments in utek under specific terms 
in exchange for these investments we received the right to purchase a percentage of utek s wafer production 
under this agreement  we invested approximately million in three separate installments 
on january   uicc and utek merged into umc 
we own approximately million shares of umc common stock and have retained our capacity rights 
due to contractual and regulatory restrictions  approximately one third of our shares may not be sold until after january  with the regulatory restrictions expiring between january and january in june  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we entered into a series of agreements with amd to support the continuing operations of vantis 
amd has agreed to provide us with finished silicon wafers through september in quantities based either on a rolling six month or an annual forecast 
we have committed to buy certain minimum quantities of wafers and amd has committed to supply certain quantities of wafers during this period 
wafers for our products are manufactured in the united states at multiple amd wafer fabrication facilities 
prices for these wafers will be reviewed and adjusted periodically 
we believe that our existing liquid resources  expected cash generated from operations and existing credit facilities combined with our ability to borrow additional funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months 
in an effort to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including joint ventures  equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december  our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
further  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our income or cash flows 
we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  a portion of our silicon wafer purchases are denominated in japanese yen 
we therefore are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to mitigate rate exposure with respect to yen denominated wafer purchases  we maintain yen denominated bank accounts and bill our japanese customers in yen 
the yen bank deposits are utilized to hedge yen denominated wafer purchases against specific and firm wafer purchases 
if the foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   the effect on our consolidated financial statements would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
we are exposed to equity price risk due to our equity investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
neither a increase nor a further decrease in equity price related to this investment would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future
