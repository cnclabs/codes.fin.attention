the rate of deflation of the prc economy  based on published consumer price information  was percent for and percent for the prc government has taken certain measures to stimulate domestic demand and consumption 
there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
market risk and risk management policies all of the company s sales and purchases are made domestically and are denominated in renminbi 
accordingly  the company and its subsidiaries do not have material market risk with respect to currency fluctuation 
as the reporting currency of the company s consolidated financial statements is also renminbi  there is no significant translation difference arising on consolidation 
however  the company may suffer exchange loss when it converts renminbi to other currencies  such as hong kong dollars or united states dollars the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of renminbi interest rates 
in this regard  changes in renminbi interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents 
as of december   the company s cash equivalents are mainly renminbi  hong kong dollar and united states dollar deposits with financial institutions  bearing market interest rates without fixed term 
as of december   the company had short term investments in marketable securities in the hong kong stock market with a total market value of rmb million us million 
these investments expose the company to market risks that may cause the future value of these investments to be lower than the original cost of such investments at the time of purchase 
the company wrote a call option to purchase certain marketable securities in hong kong on december  with an expiry date on february   which exposed the company to market risk of an unfavourable change in the price of the security underlying the written option 
the call option was subsequently left unexercised upon the expiry date
