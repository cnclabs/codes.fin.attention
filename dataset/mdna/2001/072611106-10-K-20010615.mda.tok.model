item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general the company does not transact any material business other than through its wholly owned subsidiary  the bank 
the bank s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the bank s provision for loan losses  loan sale activities and loan servicing 
the bank s noninterest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing  advertising and business promotion and other expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact the bank 
this form k contains forward looking statements that are based on assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations of the company 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company and the subsidiaries include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the u 
s treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality and composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the company s market area  changes in real estate market values in the company s market area and changes in relevant accounting principles and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
except as required by applicable law and regulation  the company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
operating strategy management s primary goal has been to maintain the bank s profitability  asset quality and its capital position by i investing primarily in one to four family loans secured by properties located in its primary market area  ii investing in multi family  commercial real estate and construction and development loans secured by properties located in the bank s primary market area  to the extent that such loans meet the bank s general underwriting criteria  iii investing funds not utilized for loan investments in short term us treasury and mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  and iv managing interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans and short term fixed rate loans and investing in short term securities and generally selling longer term fixed rate loans that the bank originates 
the bank intends to continue this operating strategy in an effort to enhance its long term profitability while maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk and enhance such strategy by expanding the products and services it offers  as necessary  in order to improve its market share in its primary market area 
in this regard  the bank offers business checking accounts  hour banking by telephone  debit card services and internet banking 
comparison of financial condition at march  and march  total assets at march  were million  compared to million at march   an increase of million  or

the yield on average interest earning assets increased basis points to 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  was million  compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average balance and cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased from million for fiscal year to million  an increase of million  or

management believes that the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses are currently reasonable and adequate to cover any losses reasonably expected in the existing loan portfolio 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurances can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  further information obtained regarding problem loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of management s control

average balances  interest and average yields costs 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended march    and the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown except where noted otherwise and reflect annualized yields and costs 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented

rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated on a proportional basis between changes in rate and volume

through such management  the bank seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the bank monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the bank s board of directors has an asset liability committee which reviews its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
such committee  which meets on a regular basis  reports trends and interest rate risk position to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the bank 
in recent years  the bank has primarily utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk i emphasizing the origination and purchase of adjustable rate loans  ii investing primarily in short term us government securities  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities with shorter estimated maturities  iii utilizing fhlb advances to better structure the maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities  and iv to a substantially lesser extent  selling in the secondary market longer term fixed rate mortgage loans originated while generally retaining the servicing rights on such loans 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at march   the bank s cumulative one year interest rate gap which is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year as a percentage of total assets  was a negative 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would be in a worse position to invest in higher yielding assets as compared to an institution with a positive gap position which  consequently  may result in the cost of its interest bearing liabilities increasing at a rate faster than its yield on interest earning assets than if it had a positive gap 
during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would tend to have its interest bearing liabilities repricing downward at a faster rate than its interest earning assets as compared to an institution with a positive gap which  consequently  may tend to positively affect the growth of its net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at march   which are anticipated by the bank  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at march   on the basis of contractual maturities  and scheduled rate adjustments within a one year period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
money market accounts  regular savings accounts and now accounts are assumed to have annual decay rates of  and  respectively 
deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on the bank s estimated gap 
while the bank believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed decay rates will approximate future withdrawal activity

fair value of securities  including mortgage backed securities  is based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
fair value of loans is  depending on the type of loan  based on carrying values or estimates based on discounted cash flow analyses 
fair value of deposit liabilities are either based on carrying amounts or estimates based on a discounted cash flow calculation 
fair values for fhlb advances are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis that applies interest rates concurrently being offered on advances to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on fhlb advances 
fair value of loans includes nonaccrual loans 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react to different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
net portfolio value 
as part of its interest rate risk analysis  the bank uses an interest rate sensitivity model which generates estimates of the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios and which is prepared by the ots on a quarterly basis 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the ots produces such analysis using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports  including estimated loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates 
the following table sets forth the bank s npv as of december  the latest npv analysis prepared by the ots  as calculated by the ots 
change in npv as of portfolio interest rates value of assets in basis points rate shock net portfolio value amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands static  expressed in basis points as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented assumes that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed and investment securities and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
on march  the ots eliminated the regulation that requires savings associations to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets of at least of its liquidity base  based on a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
even though the percentage requirement has been eliminated  the interim rule still requires thrifts to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operation 
the bank manages its liquidity position and demands for funding primarily by investing excess funds in short term investments and utilizing fhlb advances in periods when the bank s demands for liquidity exceed funding from deposit inflows 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and securities 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash and cash equivalents and investment securities totalled million  or of total assets 
the bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including fhlb advances 
at march   the bank had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and an additional overall borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million 
depending on market conditions  the pricing of deposit products and fhlb advances  the bank may continue to rely on fhlb borrowings to fund asset growth 
at march   the bank had commitments to fund loans and unused outstanding lines of credit and undisbursed proceeds of construction mortgages totalling million 
the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate accounts  including ira and keogh accounts  which are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march   totalled million 
the bank relies on competitive rates  quality customer service and long standing relationships with customers to retain deposits 
based upon the bank s historical experience with deposit retention  management believes that  although it is not possible to predict future terms and conditions upon renewal  a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
at march   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million  or  of total adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or  of total adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and risk based capital of million  or  of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this form k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results generally in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
