item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general for most of the three fiscal years ending june   the company s only active subsidiary was amplicon  and therefore  the results for such years are almost exclusively related to its operations 
the company s revenues were generated from its leasing activities  the sale of leased property and interest income earned on its cash and liquid investments 
direct financing lease revenues include interest income earned on the company s investment in lease receivables and residuals and gains recognized on the sale of leases in which the company retains no significant continuing interest 
revenues from sales type leases consist of the re lease of off lease property lease extensions and new lease transactions that qualify as sales type leases  generally where the fair value of the property subject to the lease differs from the company s carrying cost 
revenues from operating leases generally involve the short term rental of leased property 
the volume of new lease transactions booked during the year ended june  was approximately million  compared to million in fiscal and million during fiscal of the new leases booked during the fiscal year ended june   approximately were structured as true leases  where the company owns the leased asset at the end of the term  while were structured as conditional sale leases  where the lessee generally may purchase the property at a predetermined minimum amount at the end of the term 
for true lease transactions  the company books a residual that is an estimate for accounting purposes of the fair value of the leased property at lease termination 
the company s estimates are reviewed continuously to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts the company may ultimately realize could differ from such estimated amounts 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including the volume of new lease originations  the volume and profitability of leased property being re marketed through re lease or sale  variations in the mix of lease originations  the credit quality of its portfolio and economic conditions in general 
the company conducts its leasing business in a manner designed to minimize its risks 
however  the assumption of risk is a key source of earnings in the leasing industry and the company is subject to risks through its investment in lease transactions in process  investment in lease receivables held in its own portfolio and residual investments 
the company establishes reserves to cover such risks and regularly reviews their adequacy considering levels of non performing leases  lessees financial condition  leased property values as well as general economic conditions and credit quality indicators 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  a decrease of  or  from the prior year 
this change was the result of a decrease of  in sales of leased property and a decrease of  in leasing revenues

leasing revenues declined by  or  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  this reduction resulted from a decrease of  or  in sales type lease revenue to  and a decrease of  in operating lease revenue to  direct financing revenue was essentially unchanged  reflecting the benefit from the larger lease portfolio held by the company 
the decrease in sales type lease revenue can be attributed to a decrease in revenue related to new lease transactions structured as sales type leases 
the decrease in operating lease revenue can be attributed to a decrease in the volume of short term lease renewals 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or  to  compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the decline in gross profit primarily reflects lower income recognized from the sale or re lease of leased property  and lower income from new lease transactions  offset by higher interest income from the lease portfolio

taxes 
the company s tax rate was for the fiscal years ended june  and  representing its estimated annual tax rates for each respective year 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating activities through internally generated funds and nonrecourse debt 
the company does not purchase property until it has received a noncancelable lease from its customer 
capital expenditures for leased property purchases are financed in part by assigning certain base term lease payments to banks or other financial institutions 
the assigned lease payments are discounted at fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize the aggregate outstanding debt 
at june   the company had outstanding nonrecourse debt aggregating  relating to property under capital leases 
in the past  the company has been able to obtain adequate nonrecourse funding commitments  and the company believes it will be able to do so in the future 
the company also retains leases in its own portfolio rather than assigning the leases to financial institutions 
over the past two fiscal years  the company has funded a significantly greater percentage of new lease transactions internally 
during the fiscal year  the company s net investment in capital leases increased by  this increase is the result of a  increase in the company s investment in lease receivables offset by a  reduction in the investment in estimated unguaranteed residual values 
the increase in minimum lease payments receivable is primarily due to more new lease transactions being retained in the company s own portfolio 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of the total dollar amount of new leases entered into by the company were held in its own portfolio  compared to during fiscal the company often makes payments to purchase leased property prior to the commencement of the lease and assignment to other financial institutions 
the disbursements for these lease transactions in process are generally made to facilitate the lessees property implementation schedule 
the lessee is contractually obligated by the lease to make rental payments directly to the company during the period that the transaction is in process  and the lessee is generally obligated to reimburse the company for all disbursements under certain circumstances 
at june   the company s investment in property acquired for transactions in process was  a decrease of  from the level at june  this decrease was primarily due to the lower volume of new lease transactions in process during fiscal in april and april  the board of directors authorized management  at its discretion  to repurchase up to  and  shares of common stock  respectively 
during the year ended june   the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  as of september    and  shares  respectively  remain available under these authorizations 
at june   the company s cash and cash equivalents were  of this amount   was held by the bank and was not available to fund the company s other operations 
the need for cash used for operating activities will increase as the company expands 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  cash flows from its financing and investing activities  and assignments on a nonrecourse basis of anticipated lease payments will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable financing needs 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk related to interest rate risk is currently not material because it does not have any interest bearing recourse debt  and at june  the bank s deposits were immaterial 
nonrecourse debt does not represent any interest rate risk to the company because it is fully amortized through direct payments from lessees to the purchaser of the lease receivable 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its cash investments  because as interest rates decrease  interest income will decrease  and future lease rates from direct financing leases  which often are based on united states treasury rates  will be lower 
the only other interest rate risk the company currently faces relates to the bank s investment in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
this investment matures in less than ninety days and therefore the fair value approximates the carrying value 
the interest rate on the investment was at june  as the banking operations of the company grow  the company will be subject to increased interest rate risk 
the bank has an asset liability management committee and policies established for managing its interest rate risk
