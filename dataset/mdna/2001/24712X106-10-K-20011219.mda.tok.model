year ended september  sales printing equipment maintenance  spares and supplies net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative research and development income loss from system sales and service interest expense interest income unrealized exchange loss income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss the company s revenues are from sales of i document production systems and related equipment  and ii maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items 
for the year ended september  fiscal  sales of document production equipment increased over the year ended september  fiscal  compared with an increase of in fiscal over the year ended september  fiscal 
the increases in fiscal and fiscal were due primarily to increased north american sales of the imaggia system 
the company completed the sale of imaggia systems in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and seven in fiscal  and as of september   had an order backlog of approximately million for its imaggia system  which it expects to ship in fiscal for some time  the company has held a dominant position in many of the international markets in which its checktronic equipment is sold 
demand for the checktronic system product line has softened in these international markets and revenues from this product line are now largely dependent on sales to emerging markets such as latin america  asia and africa 
the present uncertain economic environment in many of the countries within these emerging markets has limited the company s current opportunities to sell high end capital equipment into those regions 
revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and consumable items increased in fiscal over fiscal  compared with a decrease in fiscal over fiscal the million increase in fiscal was due to the significant increase in the installed base of imaggia systems in fiscal and the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the impact of the stronger us dollar on the translation of foreign currency denominated sales  the continued reduction in maintenance and consumables revenues from pacific rim customers  and the reduction in consumable revenues from western european customers 
the company expects domestic revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts  supplies and 
table of contents consumable items to increase in fiscal with the projected growth of the imaggia system product line  partially offset by the projected decline in international maintenance and consumable revenues 
the company s gross margin percentage in fiscal was  compared with and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal was primarily due to the shift in the product mix from the checktronic system product line to the imaggia system product line  coupled with lower margins on the increased level of service revenues 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non recurring supplier price adjustment  which for the quarter contributed approximately points to gross margin 
the decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal was primarily due to the shift in the product mix from the checktronic system product line to the imaggia system product line and the decreased revenues from the sale of maintenance  spares and supplies 
the company anticipates that its gross margin percentage in fiscal will be somewhat lower than in fiscal due to a shift in sales mix as maintenance  spares and supplies revenues comprise a larger portion of total revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  and were million higher in fiscal than in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses were in fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal increased expense levels between fiscal years were due to the increase in employees and associated expenses required to support the increase in total revenues 
for fiscal  approximately million of the total increase was due to expansion of the field force supporting the higher installed base of the imaggia system 
the company anticipates that its selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal may continue to increase to support the projected growth in total revenues  but at a rate less than the projected total revenue rate of growth 
research and development expenses of million in fiscal were slightly lower  compared with fiscal and fiscal  and decreased year to year as a percentage of net sales 
in terms of dollars invested  research and development expenses are expected to remain flat in fiscal net interest expense was  in fiscal  compared with net interest income of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the significant shift to a net interest expense position in fiscal was due to current fiscal year borrowing against the bank line of credit to fund operating activities  which had not been necessary in fiscal or fiscal unrealized exchange gains or losses are related to the company s foreign operations 
the company experiences foreign currency gains and losses  which are reflected on the company s statements of operations  due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar against the currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries and the resulting effect of the valuation of the intercompany accounts and certain assets of the subsidiaries  which are denominated in us dollars 
the net exchange losses for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively  due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the company anticipates that it will continue to have exchange gains or losses from foreign operations in the future  although strategies to reduce the size of the gains or losses will be reviewed and implemented whenever economical and practical 
the company recorded an income tax expense of in fiscal  compared with an income tax benefit of in fiscal and an income tax benefit of in fiscal the income tax expense for fiscal has changed as a percentage primarily because the company generated pre tax earnings in fiscal and incurred pre tax losses in fiscal the income tax benefit increase from in fiscal to in reflects a lower benefit in fiscal because of an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company believes recorded net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recoverable  based upon its estimates of future sources of taxable income and the expected timing of temporary difference reversals 
the company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to recover its net deferred tax assets from increased sales of its imaggia system product line  sales of the ps micr systems product line and continued sales of maintenance  spares and supplies 

table of contents net income for fiscal was per share  compared with a net loss of per share in fiscal and a net loss of per share in fiscal the return to profitability in fiscal was due to the increase in document production systems revenues  offset by the effect of reduced gross margins  increased selling  general and administrative expenses  fiscal interest expense versus fiscal interest income  and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

customer service and transition issues delayed the office closing until the first quarter of fiscal as a result of this delay and refinement of closing cost estimates  an additional charge of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  bringing the total one time charge to  by closing the subsidiary  the company anticipates eliminating annual operating expenses of approximately  beginning in fiscal  with no further loss of revenues from pacific rim customers as a result of this change

while the company anticipates that sales of the ps micr systems product line will comprise a larger portion of its document production systems revenues in future periods  there can be no assurances that sales levels will be either higher  or high enough to retain current rights of exclusivity 
the company s net sales and operating results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because i the company s sales cycle is relatively long  ii the size of orders may vary significantly  iii the availability of financing for customers in some countries is variable  iv customers may postpone or cancel orders  and v economic  political and market conditions in some markets change with minimal notice and effect the timing and size of orders
