the effect of foreign currency translations was not material to the company s results of operations for the year ended december  currency translations on export sales or import purchases could be adversely effected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
the company s greatest sensitivity with respect to market risk is to changes in the general level of us interest rates and its effect upon the company s interest expense 
at december   the company had long term debt totaling  that bears interest at the prime rate
