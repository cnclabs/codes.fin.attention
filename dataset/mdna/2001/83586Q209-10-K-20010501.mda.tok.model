each share of our sorrento subsidiary s series a preferred stock is convertible into one share of its common stock at the option of the holder  may vote on an as converted basis except for election of directors  and has a liquidation preference of per share 
the shares are automatically converted into sorrento s common stock upon an underwritten public offering by sorrento with an aggregate offering price of at least million 
since sorrento did not complete a million public offering by march   the holders of more than of the then outstanding series a shares may request to be redeemed at the shares then adjusted liquidation preference

in the event we issue shares of our common stock or equity securities convertible into our common stock at a price less than per share the purchasers are entitled to receive additional shares of common stock 
we anticipate that our available cash resources  and marketable securities available for sale together with the proceeds of sorrento s private placement  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated capital requirements for the next year 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned including the need for additional working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
there can be no assurances that our working capital requirements will not exceed our ability to generate sufficient cash internally to support our requirements and that external financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 
effects of inflation and currency exchange rates we believe that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in the united states over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results or on the prices of raw materials 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future 
the majority of our sales and expenses are currently denominated in us dollars and to date our business has not been significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
however  we conduct business in several different countries and thus fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive in particular countries  leading to a reduction in sales in that country 
in addition  inflation in such countries could increase our expenses 
in the future  we may engage in foreign currency denominated sales or pay material amounts of expenses in foreign currencies and  in such event  may experience gains and losses due to currency fluctuations 
our operating results could be adversely affected by such fluctuations

the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab which broadly addresses how companies report revenues in their financial statements effective the fourth fiscal quarter of years beginning after december  the adoption of this policy had no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
other matters see item legal proceedings contained herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk is the result of our need for periodic additional financing for our large operating losses and capital expenditures associated with establishing and expanding our operations 
the interest rate that we will be able to obtain on debt financing will depend on market conditions at that time  and may differ from the rates we have secured on our current debt 
additionally  the interest rates charged by our present lenders adjust on the basis of the lenders prime rate 
almost all of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 
a portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and in the future a larger portion of our sales could also be denominated in non us currencies 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business could cause foreign currency translation gains or losses that we would recognize in the period incurred 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
we attempt to minimize our currency exposure risk through working capital management and do not hedge our exposure to translation gains and losses related to foreign currency net asset exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
investments held for other than trading purposes do not impose a material market risk 
we believe that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in the united states over the past few years and the relatively stable interest rates incurred on short term financing have not had a significant impact on our sales  operating results or prices of raw materials 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation or an upward trend in short term interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future should we require debt financing in the future
