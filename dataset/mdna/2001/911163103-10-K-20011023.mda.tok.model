item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading national distributor of natural and organic foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the acquisition of or merger with natural products distributors  the expansion of existing distribution centers and the continued growth of the natural products industry in general 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
our distribution operations are divided into three principal units united natural foods in the eastern region previously cornucopia natural foods  inc and stow mills  inc  mountain people s warehouse  inc and rainbow natural foods in the western region previously rainbow natural foods solely comprised the central region  and albert s organics in various markets in the united states 
through our subsidiary  the natural retail group  we also own and operate twelve natural products retail stores located in the eastern united states 
we believe our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business enabling us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
in addition  hershey import co  located in rahway  new jersey  is a business that specializes in the international trading  roasting and packaging of nuts  seeds  dried fruits and snack items 
we are continually integrating certain operating functions in order to improve operating efficiencies  including i expanding marketing and customer service programs across the three regions  ii expanding national purchasing opportunities  iii consolidating systems applications between physical locations and regions  iv integrating administrative and accounting functions  and v reducing geographic overlap between regions 
in addition  our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
we have made considerable capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the expansion of our facilities  including the expansion of our auburn  california  new oxford  pennsylvania and albert s los angeles locations 
we recently signed a lease to move our atlanta  georgia distribution center to a  square foot facility  an increase of approximately  square feet 
while we anticipate incremental short term costs between million and million during the second and third quarters of fiscal while we relocate operations into this facility  we expect the efficiencies created by consolidating our two existing facilities into one to lower our expenses relative to sales over the long term 
we are expanding our western region operations into the los angeles area and recently signed an agreement to lease a  square foot distribution center with the option to lease an additional  square feet for expansion 
the los angeles facility will enable us to provide enhanced service levels to our southwestern customers and to further penetrate that market 
while we anticipate short term incremental costs of approximately million  we expect to realize transportation savings and efficiencies once we are operational early in calendar year upon the completion of the los angeles expansion  the increased capacity of our distribution centers will be approximately greater than it was five years ago 
while operating margins may be affected in periods in which these expenses are incurred  over the long term  we expect to benefit from the increased absorption of our expenses over a larger sales base 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amount paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  administrative  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
our operating margin excluding restructuring costs increased from in fiscal to for the fiscal year ended july  results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses merger  restructuring and asset impairment expenses amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense other  net total other expense income income before income taxes income taxes net income twelve months ended july  compared to twelve months ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to increased sales throughout all divisions and distribution channels including super naturals  independents and mass market 
we also experienced market share gains during fiscal year by selling to a greater number of new customers 
sales to our two largest customers  whole foods market  inc and wild oats markets  inc 
represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales for the twelve months ended july  whole foods market  inc represented approximately and wild oats markets  inc represented approximately  of net sales for the twelve months ended july  we expect sales for fiscal to increase from fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  the increase in gross profit resulted primarily from our recovery in our eastern region as customer returns and allowances  inventory shrink  pricing errors and inbound transportation costs decreased significantly 
this increase was partially offset by inventory loss at an outside storage location  as well as reduced margins in our albert s organics division 
additionally  the gain in our gross profit was further offset by a change in our channel mix as the percentage of our sales to super naturals  which are at lower gross margins  increased 
we expect the increase in percentage of sales to super naturals to continue in future periods 
we expect our gross margin as a percentage of sales to be for fiscal operating expenses 
our total operating expenses  excluding special charges  increased approximately  or million  to million for the twelve months ended july  from million for the twelve months ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special charges  decreased to for the twelve months ended july  from for the twelve months ended july  the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to increased labor productivity in our distribution centers  increased efficiencies in our transportation departments as a result of better routing and successfully leveraging our fixed expenses against a higher sales base 
the improved labor productivity was due primarily to a more favorable labor market nationwide and higher retention rate of experienced warehouse employees 
the improved transportation routing resulted in less miles traveled by our fleet  and corresponding reductions in expenses 
we expect to reduce our operating expenses  excluding special charges  as a percentage of sales to less than as we continue to realize operating efficiencies and expand our sales base 
we also expect to incur additional special charges as we increase our warehouse capacity 
operating expenses for the twelve months ended july  included special charges of million related to the expansion of our new oxford  pa distribution facility  and million of asset impairment charges  primarily goodwill  associated with the closing of an unprofitable retail store 
our operating expenses for the twelve months ended july  were impacted by several special charges 
these charges included approximately million of executive severance costs and the write off of current assets in the eastern region and chicago and approximately million of restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the write off of certain eastern region fixed assets and the planned closing of our chicago facility 
operating expenses  including special charges  decreased approximately or million  to million for the twelve months ended july  from million for the twelve months ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses  including special charges  decreased to for the twelve months ended july  from for the twelve months ended july  operating income 
operating income  excluding the special charges discussed above  increased million to million for the twelve months ended july  compared to million for the twelve months ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating income  excluding special charges  increased to for the twelve months ended july  compared to for the twelve months ended july  operating income  including special charges  increased million to million for the twelve months ended july  compared to million for the comparable prior period 
other income expense 
the million increase in other expense for the twelve months ended july  compared to the twelve months ended july  was attributable to slightly higher debt levels and non cash expense related to an interest rate swap that were partially offset by lower interest rates 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires recognition in the financial statements of the change in fair value during the year of certain interest rate protection contracts and other derivatives 
we recorded fas expense of million on our interest rate swap agreement resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the year 
we will continue to recognize this income or expense for the duration of the swap contract until either october or  depending on whether the contract is extended 
we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement effective august  with a termination date of either august or august whether we recognize income or expense in any given quarter  and the magnitude of that item  is dependent on interest rates and the remaining term of the contract 
upon expiration of the swap contract  the cumulative earnings impact will be zero 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates benefit were and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates for and were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes 
net loss income 
as a result  net income was million for the year ended july   compared to a net loss of million in the year ended july   an increase of million 
excluding the million sfas no 
expense million  net of tax  the million special charge related to the expansion of our new oxford distribution center million  net of tax  and million of asset impairment related primarily to the closing of an unprofitable retail store million  net of tax in fiscal and million in other special charges million  net of tax and million in restructuring costs million net of tax in fiscal  net income would have been million and million in and respectively  resulting in an increase of approximately million for the year ended july  
we expect earnings per diluted share  excluding any special charges  of for fiscal twelve months ended july  compared to twelve months ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  the overall increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales to existing customers  the sale of new product offerings and sales to new customers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in net sales from the natural retail group due to the sale of four stores and the closing of one store in april excluding the natural retail group s fiscal sales by the sold and closed stores  sales increased approximately for the year ended july  over the comparable prior year period 
this growth rate is lower than in past years 
the major factor contributing to our lower growth rate was loss of volume in the eastern region to other suppliers due to difficulties encountered in the consolidation effort 
another contributing factor was the closure of our chicago facility and the resulting inability to fully service this region from our aurora  co and new oxford  pa facilities  which resulted in combined lost sales for our third and fourth quarters of approximately million 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from ongoing difficulties with the eastern region consolidation  as well as an increased percentage of sales to existing customers under our volume discount program and the divestiture of four retail stores  which have higher gross margins than our distribution business 
difficulties in the eastern region  which impacted our margin  include higher than normal levels of customer returns and allowances  pricing errors  inventory shrink and higher inbound transportation costs for expedited shipments 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our operating expenses for the year ended july  were also impacted by approximately million of restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the write off of certain eastern region fixed assets and the closing of our chicago facility 
excluding fiscal restructuring and asset impairment costs of million and other special charges of million  and fiscal restructuring costs of million  total operating expenses for the years ended july  and would have been million or of net sales  and million or of net sales  respectively  resulting in an increase for the year ended july  of million  or over the comparable prior period 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the continuing difficulties in the eastern region  including redundant transportation expenses  reduced labor productivity  and outside storage expenses 
an increase in the cost of fuel of approximately million during the year impacted all of our distribution centers 
in addition  increased labor expenses related to the tight labor market limited our ability to attract and retain trained qualified employees in the eastern region particularly  but also affected all of our distribution centers 
operating income 
operating income decreased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in the year ended july  from in the comparable period 
excluding the restructuring  asset impairment and other special charges noted above  operating income for the year ended july  and would have been million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales  respectively  resulting in a decrease for the year ended july  of million versus the comparable prior period 
other income expense 
the million increase in other expense for the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was attributable to a million gain on the sale of retail stores in and higher interest expense of approximately million in  reflecting a higher level of debt for fiscal income taxes 
our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates for and were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and the settlement of an irs audit for million in net loss income 
as a result  net income decreased by million to a net loss of million  for the year ended july  from net income of million in the year ended july  excluding the million in restructuring costs million  net of tax and the million in special charges million  net of tax in fiscal and the million in restructuring costs million  net of tax  the million gain on the sale of four retail stores million  net of tax and the million irs settlement in fiscal  net income would have been million and million  respectively  resulting in a decrease for the year ended july  of million over the comparable prior period 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed operations and growth primarily from cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  seller financing of acquisitions  operating and capital leases  trade payables  bank indebtedness and the sale of equity and debt securities 
primary uses of capital have been acquisitions  expansion of plant and equipment and investments in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july  and million for the year ended july  cash provided by operations in fiscal related primarily to cash collected from customers net of cash paid to vendors  partially offset by investments in inventory in the normal course of business 
days sales outstanding at july  remained unchanged from july  at days 
the increases in inventory levels relate to supporting increased sales with wider product assortment combined with our ability to capture purchasing efficiency opportunities in excess of total carrying costs 
these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash used in operations in fiscal related primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and investments in inventory in the ordinary course of business 
working capital at july  was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
investing activities in fiscal years and were primarily for capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july  due to proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayment of long term debt of approximately million and principal payments on capital leases of approximately million 
we increased borrowings on our line of credit by million during fiscal that was partially offset by debt repayments of million 
as of july  we had less than million available under our revolving credit facility 
in september we entered into an agreement to increase our secured revolving credit facility to million from million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on june  the proceeds were used to refinance our existing credit facility  several fixed rate mortgage loans  and an equipment loan 
this additional access to capital will provide for working capital requirements in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a five year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million 
the five year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years at the option of the counter party  which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas no 
we entered into a second swap agreement in august this agreement provides for us to pay interest for a four year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
if libor exceeds in a given period the agreement is suspended for that period 
the four year term of the swap agreement may be extended to six years at the option of the counterparty  which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas no 
impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass along inflation related increases 
consequently  inflation has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations or profitability 
seasonality generally  we do not experience any material seasonality 
however  our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses  management s ability to execute our operating and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages and general economic conditions 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments  and hedging activities related to those instruments  as well as other hedging activities  and was amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires recognition in the financial statements of the change in fair value during the quarter of certain interest rate protection contracts and other derivatives 
we adopted fas on august  we recorded million in other expense resulting from the significant decline in interest rates and the related impact on our interest rate swap agreement during the year ended july in july  the financial accounting standards board finalized fasb statements no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
sfas no 
is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
sfas no 
requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
we are also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of sfas no 
we early adopted sfas no 
on august  as of july  we had goodwill of million less accumulated amortization of million with amortization expense of approximately million in fiscal therefore  we expect a reduction of approximately million in operating expenses in fiscal as the result of adopting sfas no

you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements  all of which are expressly qualified by the statement in this section 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
successful integration of mergers is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
integration requires  among other things the optimization of delivery routes  coordination of administrative  distribution and finance functions  and the integration of personnel 
the integration process has and could divert the attention of management and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining companies has and could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
there can be no assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of mergers 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
there can be no assurance that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in highly competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than us  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than united natural to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
we depend heavily on our principal customers our ability to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with our top two customers  whole foods market  inc and wild oats markets  inc  is important to the ongoing growth and profitability of our business 
whole foods market  inc  recently agreed to extend our current distribution arrangement through august  whole foods and wild oats accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales during the fiscal year ended july  as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from either of these customers  including from increased distribution to their own facilities  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
no assurance can be given that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of super natural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts 
our industry is sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  difficulties with inventory control  competitive pricing pressures  and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of michael s 
funk  chief executive officer  steven townsend  president  todd weintraub  chief financial officer  kevin t 
michel  president of our western region and other key management employees 
loss of the services of any officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to changes in our operating expenses  management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages  general economic conditions  changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and our trucking operations are regulated by the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our officers and directors and the employee stock ownership trust have significant voting power 
as of october   our executive officers and directors  and their affiliates  and the united natural foods employee stock ownership trust beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of united natural s common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  if acting together  may have the ability to impact the election of our directors and determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  depending on how other stockholders may vote 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of united natural 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of july   approximately employees  representing approximately of our approximately  employees  were union members 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
access to capital and the cost of that capital in september we entered into an agreement to increase our secured revolving credit facility to million from million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on june  the proceeds were used to refinance our existing credit facility  several fixed term mortgage loans  and an equipment loan 
this additional access to capital will provide for working capital requirements in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital 
in the event that capital market turmoil significantly increases our cost of capital or limits our ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital  we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
