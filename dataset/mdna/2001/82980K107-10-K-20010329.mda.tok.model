financial condition cash flows the following table sets forth summary cash flow data for the periods indicated 
please refer to this summary as you read our discussion of the sources and uses of cash in each year 
years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    in  cash provided by operating activities consisted mostly of income before non cash expenses of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
although accounts receivable decreased during the period  we anticipate accounts receivable will increase as we continue to grow  requiring additional financing 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
this was partially offset by million of cash proceeds we received from sales of property and equipment 
in  we used cash for financing activities to repay million of debt and capital lease obligations  net of additional borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  resulting in net repayments of million 
in  cash provided by operating activities consisted mostly of income before non cash expenses of million and a million increase in accrued expenses and trade payables  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
this was partially offset by million of cash proceeds we received from sale leasebacks of facilities and equipment 
we also acquired million of property and equipment under capital leases 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million  as payments we made on debt and capital lease obligations were offset by additional borrowings 
in  cash provided by operating activities consisted mostly of income before non cash expenses of million  partially offset by an million increase in accounts receivable 
in  we used cash in investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment and we used million for acquisitions 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of cash proceeds we received from sale leasebacks of facilities 
in  cash provided by financing activities primarily came from additional borrowings on notes payable 
during  we also completed the private placement of million of senior subordinated notes due we used the proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings outstanding under our long term revolving credit facility 
capital resources we have historically used funds generated from operations  leases of property and equipment  equity capital  senior subordinated notes  and borrowings under credit facilities with banks to finance business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
we have a million senior secured credit facility  with the ability to increase the size of the facility to million  which expires in april under the terms of this agreement  we may borrow in us dollars  british pounds sterling  and euros  which allows us to consolidate our us and european bank lines into a single multi borrower  multi currency facility 
in connection with obtaining this facility in april  we terminated our existing million long term credit facility and various lines of credit  which were used to fund local operations in british pounds sterling and euros 
the funds available under the new facility are approximately equal to the total of the funds that were available under the terminated facilities 
our obligations under the new facility have been guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of sitel corporation and such subsidiaries  including a pledge of our shares in such subsidiaries and certain other foreign subsidiaries 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and certain restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain restricted payments  make certain investments  sell assets  or merge with another company 
the facility becomes due and payable upon a change of control of the company as defined in the credit agreement 
at december   we had million of available borrowings under this facility 
we expect to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures  and internal growth for the foreseeable future using funds generated from operations  existing cash  leases of property and equipment  and the funds available under our credit facility 
we estimate that our capital expenditures will range from to million 
future acquisitions  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing 
we may also use these sources of funds to repurchase up to million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in february under the program  we may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on general business and market conditions 
the program will provide us with treasury shares for general corporate purposes  including stock to be issued under employee stock option plans 
at the date of this report  we had repurchased  shares under the program 
other matters quarterly results and seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our results of operations mostly due to the timing of our clients customer relationship management initiatives and customer acquisition and loyalty campaigns  the commencement and terms of new contracts  revenue mix  the timing of additional operating  selling  and administrative expenses to support new business  and the timing of recognition of incentive fees 
we experience periodic fluctuations in our results of operations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion and the implementation of clients crm activities 
in addition  our business tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe  and in the first quarter due to the changeover of client marketing strategies that often occurs at the beginning of the year 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on our operations in the future 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative investments and certain hedging activities 
the standard amends certain provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  which was issued in june to establish accounting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
we adopted these accounting pronouncements effective january  the adoption of these standards  including the valuation of derivative instruments outstanding on the effective date  will not significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated primarily with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have operations in many parts of the world  however  both revenues and expenses of those operations are typically denominated in the currency of the country of operations  providing a natural hedge 
we entered into certain hedging transactions during   and designed to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to short term intercompany loans  however the amounts involved were not material 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 
interest rates on the majority of our long term debt are fixed  but rates on borrowings under our bank credit facility are variable 
during the year ended december   our average borrowings under our bank credit facility were million 
based on our projected cash needs for the foreseeable future  we do not expect that our exposure to changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our interest expense
