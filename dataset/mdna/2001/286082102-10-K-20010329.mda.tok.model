item legal proceedings 
on december   a shareholder class action lawsuit  entitled steele  et al 
v 
electronics for imaging  inc  et al  no 
cv  was filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors in the california superior court  san mateo county the san mateo superior court 
five virtually identical class action complaints were subsequently filed in the san mateo superior court 
on december   a putative shareholder class action entitled smith v 
electronics for imaging  inc  et al  no 
c was filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the state court class actions allege that the company made false and misleading statements concerning its business during a putative class period of april  through december  and allege violations of california corporations code sections and and civil code sections and the federal court class action complaint makes the same factual allegations  but alleges violations of certain united states federal securities laws 
the complaints do not specify the damages sought 
the company believes that these lawsuits are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously  but there can be no assurance that if damages are ultimately awarded against the company  the litigation will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
on february   the us magistrate judge handling the patent litigation between the company and splash granted the company s motion to dismiss the complaint and splash s counterclaims 
the court s order ends the litigation and brings to a close all pending patent issues between the company and splash 
in january  two class action complaints were filed  and subsequently consolidated into one case  in the united states district court for the northern district of california against splash and certain of its officers 
the complaints allege that defendants made false and misleading statements about splash s business condition and prospects during a class period of january  october   and assert claims for violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and sec rule b the complaints in both actions seek damages of an unspecified amount 
there has been no discovery to date and no trial is scheduled in these actions 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses in this action and intends to defend it vigorously 
failure by the company to obtain a favorable resolution of the claims set forth in these actions could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
currently  the amount of such material effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
on august   after the announcement of the tender offer for splash  a shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against splash and its directors for violation of federal and state securities laws 
the plaintiffs  splash and the company have agreed in principle to enter into a settlement agreement that would resolve the outstanding disputes and dismiss the case with prejudice 
the parties are currently finalizing the details of the settlement agreement 
the company and splash deny any wrongdoing whatsoever  but agreed to the settlement to eliminate the burden and expense of further litigation 
in addition  the company is involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of its business 
the company believes that the ultimate resolution of such claims will not materially affect the company s business or financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
all assumptions  anticipations  expectations and forecasts contained herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
for a discussion of the factors that could impact the company s results  readers are referred to the section below entitled factors that could adversely affect performance 
results of operations the following tables set forth items in the company s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenue for  and  and the year to year percentage change from over and from over  respectively 
these operating results are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
years ended december  change over over revenue cost of revenue gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related charges merger related expenses operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue the company s revenue in was principally derived from three major categories 
the first category was made up of stand alone servers which connect digital color copiers with computer networks 
this category includes the fiery x  x  zx and z products and accounted for a majority of the company s revenue prior to the second category consisted of embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions and chipsets primarily for the office market 
the third category consisted of controllers for digital black and white products 
the following is a break down of revenue in dollars and volumes as a percentage of total units shipped by category 
change revenue over over in thousands revenue revenue revenue stand alone servers connecting to digital color copiers    embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions chipset solutions    controllers for digital black and white solutions    spares  licensing other misc 
sources    total revenue    volume volume volume volume stand alone servers connecting to digital color copiers embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions chipset solutions controllers for digital black and white solutions spares  licensing other misc 
sources total volume revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in  which yielded a increase in as compared to and a increase in as compared to the corresponding unit volume increased by in over and by in over the increase in revenue in from and in from was primarily due to increases in unit volumes and positive market acceptance of new product introductions  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices due to changes in product mix 
the small sequential increase in from compared to the increase from over was due to delays in oem partner product launches  disruption in distribution channels due to financial and operating constraints in the imaging market and worsening general economic conditions the category of stand alone servers made up of total revenue and of total unit volume in the increase in revenue over was driven by introduction of new products by our oem partners 
it made up of total revenue and of total unit volume in and of total revenue and of total unit volume in the products in this category continue to offer higher margins relative to the other product lines 
as products that were previously only offered with the stand alone servers are now offered with embedded controllers  some of the volume in this category will transition to the embedded category 
the desktop product category made up of total revenue and of total unit volume in it made up of total revenue and of total unit volume in and of total revenue and of total unit volume in the decline from in absolute dollars in this category was primarily the result of product transitions 
as oem partners planned to move to new platforms  sales of existing products declined 
these products  except for the chipset solutions  are also generally characterized by much higher unit volumes but lower unit prices and associated margins than the company has experienced in its more traditional stand alone server line of products 
the chipset solutions can be characterized by lower unit prices but significantly higher per unit margins compared to the traditional stand alone server line of products 
the black and white product category made up of total revenue and of total unit volume in this category  first introduced in  has seen continued growth  with of the revenue and of the volume in and only of the revenue and of the unit volume in this product category can be characterized by much higher unit volumes and lower unit prices and associated margins than the company has experienced in its more traditional stand alone server line of products 
the company anticipates further growth in the black and white as well as in the desktop category as a percentage of total revenue 
to the extent these categories do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if the company is not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the new products for will be qualified by all the oems  or that they will successfully compete  or be accepted by the market  or otherwise be able to effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from the older products 
the company also believes that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for all of its products may affect revenues in the future 
the company has made and may in the future make price reductions for its products 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for the company s products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and profits 
if the company is not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the company s revenue in the future depends more upon sales of products with relatively lower gross margins than the company obtained in such as embedded controllers for printers  embedded controllers for color and black and white copiers  and stand alone controllers for black and white copiers  results of operations may be adversely affected 
shipments by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended december  change over over in thousands north america    europe    japan    rest of world    while shipments to north america and europe saw a increase in over  japan saw a decrease of and the rest of world region  primarily asia pacific  remained flat 
the asia pacific and japan drop in revenue stems from increasing sales of low end products as well as the continuing difficult economic times in these regions 
worldwide economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
as shipments to some of the company s oem partners are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations which in turn sell through to other locations  the company believes that export sales of its products into each region may differ from what is reported  though accurate data is difficult to obtain 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue 
substantially all of the revenue for the last three years was attributable to sales of products through the company s oem channels with such partners as canon  encad  epson  fuji xerox  ibm  hewlett packard  kodak danka business systems  konica  lanier  minolta  oce  ricoh  sharp  xerox and others 
during  the company has continued to work on both increasing the number of oem partners  and expanding the size of existing relationships with oem partners 
the company relied on three oem customers  canon  xerox and ricoh in aggregate for   and of its revenue for  and  respectively 
in the event that any of these oem relationships are scaled back or discontinued  the company may experience a significant negative impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the company s relationships with these oem partners will continue 
the company continues to work on the development of products utilizing the fiery  splash and edox architecture and other products and intends to continue to introduce new generations of server and controller products and other new product lines with current and new oem s in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of new  current or future products will be successful 
cost of revenue the company s color servers as well as embedded desktop controllers and digital black and white products are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
the company sources directly processors  memory  certain asics  and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which the company licenses from adobe systems  inc gross margins the company s gross margin was  and for  and respectively 
the decrease in gross margin from to from to was primarily due to a higher mix of low end products with relatively lower margins as well as increased component costs in the volatile components market experienced throughout most of the increase in gross margin from to from to was attributable to volume driven economies of scale as well as increased outsourcing of manufacturing operations to lower cost subcontract manufacturers 
the company expects that sales of products with relatively lower margins may further increase as a percentage of revenue 
such products include embedded products for both desktop printers and copiers  stand alone servers  embedded controllers for black and white copiers and older products for which prices are reduced during product transitions 
if such sales increase as a percentage of the company s revenue  gross margins may decline 
in general  the company believes that gross margins will continue to be impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on the company s current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of the company s product transitions and new products  competition  and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  the company anticipates gross margins will fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  the company expects to be subject to pressures to reduce prices  and as a result  gross margins for all of its products may be lower and therefore the company s ability to maintain current gross margins may not continue 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue amounted to  and for  and  respectively 
increases in operating expenses in absolute dollars of million before the amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related charges in compared to and million in compared to  were primarily caused by costs associated with the development and introduction of new products and the hiring of additional full time employees to support the growing business a net increase of people at december  over december  and a net increase of people at december  over december  
the company hired additional employees to support product development as well as to support expanded operations  including new operations and functions being performed in the netherlands 
operating expenses for included approximately million of acquisition related costs and the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in connection with the acquisition of splash in october in the company incurred million of merger related expenses associated with the merger of mgi 
in addition  the company incurred additional non recurring expenses during in connection with the company s move to a new central facility in foster city  california 
total moving costs amounted to million of which approximately million related to cost of revenue 
the company anticipates that operating expenses will continue to grow and may increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
the components of operating expenses are detailed below 
research and development expenses for research and development consist primarily of personnel expenses and  to a lesser extent  consulting  depreciation and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the year over year increase in research and development expenses was mainly due to an increase in research and development projects 
the majority of the increase in research and development expenses in compared to and in compared to was due to a and growth  respectively  in engineering headcount 
the company believes that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to its continued success  and intends to continue to devote substantial resources to research and product development efforts 
accordingly  the company expects that its research and development expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel expenses  costs for trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  japan and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in and million or in sales and marketing expenses showed no change in over as a percentage of revenue 
the nominal increase in absolute dollars is primarily due to the broader product line the company now supports offset by continued efforts to control spending across the company during in addition the gravitation toward desktop and embedded products require less support from the company as the oem s take over some of the financial responsibilities for the support 
the decrease of sales and marketing expenses in over is primarily due to tightly controlled spending  offset by a increase in headcount 
the company expects that its sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue as it continues to actively promote its products  launch new products and continue to build its sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and asia pacific  including japan 
this expected increase might not proportionally increase with increases in volume if the company s sales continue to gravitate toward desktop and embedded products which require less support from the company as the oem partners take over this role 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and facility costs  professional fees and other costs associated with public companies 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in while general and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue over the three year period ended  these expenses have increased in absolute dollars 
the increases in over and in over were primarily due to the increase in headcount to support the needs of the growing company s operations  including a growing business development department  the establishment of a dutch transaction processing center which now handles the majority of the company s international business and higher legal costs to register and defend our intellectual property 
the company expects that its general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue in order to support the company s efforts to grow its business 
amortization of goodwill and acquisition related charges in october of  the company acquired splash for approximately million  net of cash received 
the acquisition was intended to expand the company s product line and further increase the company s market share  primarily in the graphic arts arena 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company recorded a charge of million for in process research and development 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisition were million for the year ended december  at december  the unamortized portion of goodwill and other intangibles totaled million and will be amortized over estimated lives ranging from to years 
merger related expenses on august  the company merged with mgi  a minnesota based corporation that develops digital print on demand products and other digital imaging products through a pooling of interests transaction 
the company incurred approximately million of non recurring expenses related to the merger which consisted primarily of professional fees  severance costs  and travel expenses 
other income other income relates mainly to interest income and expense  and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
other income of million in increased by from million in other income of million in increased by from million in the increase in from and in from is due to an increase in the average investment balance as well as a higher return on investments as a result of more favorable market interest rates in compared to income taxes the company s pro forma effective tax rate  excluding the effect of non deductible in process technology and goodwill  was in  while the actual tax rate was 
in and  the actual effective tax rate was and  respectively 
in each of these years  the company benefited from tax exempt interest income  a foreign sales corporation  and the utilization of the research and development credits in achieving a consolidated effective tax rate lower than that prescribed by the respective federal and state taxing authorities 
the company anticipates that the pro forma effective tax rate for will remain approximately 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million to million as of december   from million as of december  working capital decreased by million to million as of december   down from million as of december  these decreases are primarily the result of the repurchase of approximately million of the company s common stock during in addition  the company has classified million as restricted investments as of december  these funds collateralize the lease discussed below 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities decreased in primarily due to a decrease in net income and an increase in deferred income taxes and inventories 
the company has continued to invest cash in short term investments  mainly municipal securities 
sales in excess of purchases of short term investments were million in  while purchases in excess of sales were million and million in and  respectively 
the company s capital expenditures generally consist of investments in computers and related peripheral equipment and office furniture for use in the company s operations 
the company purchased approximately million  million and million of such equipment and furniture during  and  respectively 
during the company invested million  net of cash received  in the acquisition of splash 
in  the company began development of a corporate campus on a acre parcel of land in foster city  california 
during and the company spent approximately million on the land and associated improvement costs 
in addition to purchasing the land  the company entered into an agreement lease to lease a ten story  square foot building to be constructed on the site 
the lessor of the building funded million for the construction of the building 
in july the company completed construction of the building and began making rent payments 
also in conjunction with the lease  the company has entered into a separate ground lease with the lessor of the building for approximately years 
in december the company entered into a second agreement lease to lease a maximum of  square feet of additional facilities  to be constructed adjacent to the first building discussed above 
as of december  the lessor has funded million of a maximum commitment of million for the construction of the facilities  with the portion of the committed amount actually used for construction to be determined by the company 
rent obligations for the building will bear a direct relationship to the carrying cost of the commitments drawn down 
construction of the facilities began in january and is scheduled for completion over the next months 
in connection with the lease  the company entered into a lease of the related parcels of land in foster city to the lessor of the buildings at a nominal rate and for a term of years 
if the company does not renew the building lease  the ground lease converts to a market rate 
both leases have an initial term of seven years  with options to renew subject to certain conditions 
the company may  at its option  purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the lease for the amount expended by the respective lessor to construct the facilities 
the company has guaranteed to the lessors a residual value associated with the buildings equal to approximately of the their funding 
the company may be liable to the lessor for the amount of the residual guarantee if it either defaults on a covenant  fails to renew the lease  or does not purchase or locate a purchaser for the leased building at the end of the lease term 
during the term of the leases the company must maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
in addition  the company has pledged certain marketable securities  which are in proportion to the amount drawn under each lease 
under the lease  the pledged collateral million at december  may be withdrawn at any time  but withdrawal results in an increase to the lease rate and the imposition of additional financial covenant restrictions 
the funds pledged under the lease million at december  may be invested by the company in certain securities  however the funds are restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
net cash used in financing activities of million in was primarily the difference between the million used to repurchase common stock and the cash received from exercises of common stock options  net of the tax benefits associated with the exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively  were primarily the result of exercises of common stock options and the tax benefits to the company associated with those exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities in  and includes approximately million  million and million of cash used to repay long term obligations 
the company s inventory consists primarily of memory subsystems  processors and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing the company s products 
should the company decide to purchase components and do its own manufacturing  or should it become necessary for the company to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for its contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially fixed assets would increase significantly  thereby reducing the company s available cash resources 
further  the inventory the company carries could become obsolescent thereby negatively impacting the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the company is also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
the company  along with its directors and certain officers and employees  has been named in class action lawsuits filed in both the san mateo county superior court and the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the lawsuits are all related to the precipitous decline in the trading price of the company s stock that occurred in december the company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously  but there can be no assurance that if damages are ultimately awarded against the company  the litigation will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
splash  along with former splash officers were named in class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the lawsuits are related to a decline in splash s stock price during the company became successor to the lawsuits when it acquired splash in october the company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously  but there can be no assurance that if damages are ultimately awarded against the company  the litigation will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with cash generated from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund its operations and meet capital requirements through at least euro assessment eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union have established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro and have adopted the euro as a common currency as of january  the euro is trading on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company as the company predominantly invoices in us dollars 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the reporting requirements in the respective countries and the related system  legal and taxation requirements 
the company expects that required modifications will be made on a timely basis and that such modifications will not have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance  however  the company will be able to complete such modifications to comply with euro requirements 
failure to comply euro requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
factors that could adversely affect performance our performance may be adversely affected by the following factors we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem partners  and the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues because we sell our products primarily to our oem partners  we rely on high sales volumes to a relatively small number of customers 
we expect that we will continue to depend on these oem partners for a significant portion of our revenues 
if we lose an important oem or we are unable to recruit additional oems  our revenues may be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that our major customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels or that they will continue to purchase our products at all 
in addition  our results of operations could be adversely affected by a decline in demand for copiers or laser printers  other factors affecting our major customers  in particular  or the computer industry in general 
xerox  our second largest customer  has experienced serious financial difficulties in their business over the past year 
if xerox continues to face such difficulties  our short term revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected through  among other things  decreased sales volumes and write offs of accounts receivables and inventory related to xerox products 
we rely upon our oem partners to develop new products  applications and product enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner 
our continued success depends upon the ability of these oems to meet changing customer needs and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
however  we cannot assure you that our oems will effectively meet these technological challenges 
these oems  who are not within our control  may incorporate into their products the technologies of other companies in addition to  or instead of our products 
these oems may introduce and support products that are not compatible with our products 
we rely on these oems to market our products with their products  and if these oems do not effectively market our products our sales revenue may be materially and adversely affected 
with the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations  these oems are not obligated to purchase products from us 
we cannot assure you that our oems will continue to carry our products 
our oems work closely with us to develop products that are specific to each oem s copiers and printers 
for many of the products we are developing  we need to coordinate development  quality testing  marketing and other tasks with our oems 
we cannot control our oems development efforts and coordinating with our oems may cause delays that we cannot manage by ourselves 
in addition  our sales revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot meet our oem s product needs for their specific copiers and printers  as well as successfully manage the additional engineering and support effort and other risks associated with such a wide range of products 
we are pursuing  and will continue to pursue  the business of additional copier and printer oems 
however  because there are a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that customer concentration will continue to be a risk 
if we are unable to develop new products  or execute product introductions on a timely basis  our future revenue and operating results may be harmed 
our operating results will depend to a significant extent on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new products and technologies 
our success depends not only on our ability to predict future requirements  but also to develop and introduce new products that successfully address customer needs 
any delays in the launch or availability of new products we are planning could harm our financial results 
during transitions from existing products to new products  customers may delay or cancel orders for existing products 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully manage product transitions or provide adequate availability of products after they have been introduced 
in this environment  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance performance and functionality of our products  including product lines different than our fiery servers and embedded controllers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and introduce new products to market in a timely manner  and achieve market acceptance of our products 
also  if we decide to develop new products  our research and development expenses may increase in the short term without a corresponding increase in revenue 
finally  we cannot assure you that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated  and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products under our license agreements with adobe  a separate license must be granted from adobe to us for each type of copier or printer used with a fiery server or controller 
if adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals  if the adobe license agreements are terminated  or if our relationship with adobe is otherwise impaired  our financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
to date  we have successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript tm software for our products  where required 
however  we cannot assure you that adobe will continue to grant future licenses to adobe postscript tm software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  we cannot assure you that adobe will continue to give us the quality assurance approvals we are required to obtain from adobe for the adobe licenses 
if the demand for products that enable color printing of digital data decreases  our sales revenue may decrease our products are primarily targeted at enabling the color printing of digital data 
if demand for this service declines  or if the demand for our oem s specific printers or copiers that our products are designed for should decline  our sales revenue may be adversely affected 
although demand for networked color printers and copiers has increased in recent years  we cannot assure you that such demand will continue  nor can we control whether the demand will continue for the specific oem printers and copiers that utilize our products will continue 
we believe that demand for our products may also be affected by a variety of economic conditions and considerations  and we cannot assure you that demand for our products will continue at current levels 
if we enter new markets or distribution channels this could result in delayed revenues or higher operating expenses we continue to explore opportunities to develop product lines different from our servers and embedded controllers  such as our new line of software products and efi professional services that we announced in february we expect to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these new products and services 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services 
in addition  even if we are able to introduce new products or services  the lack of marketplace acceptability of these new products or services may adversely impact the company s operating results 
we sell products that are large capital expenditures as well as discretionary purchase items 
in difficult economic times  such as the current economic climate  spending on information technology is often decreased 
as our products are of a more discretionary nature than many other technology products  we may be more adversely impacted than other technology firms 
we are subject to economic sensitivity that could harm our results of operations 
we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers  and if we are not able to compete successfully then our business may be harmed our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological changes 
we compete against a number of other suppliers of imaging products 
we cannot assure you that products or technologies developed by competing suppliers will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
while many of our oem s sell our products on an exclusive basis  we do not have any formal agreements that prevent the oems from offering alternative products 
if an oem offers products from alternative suppliers our market share could decrease  which could reduce our revenue and negatively affect our financial results 
our oem partners may themselves internally develop and supply products similar to our current products 
these oems may be able to develop similar products that are compatible with their own products more quickly than we can 
these oems may choose to market their own products  even if these products are technologically inferior  have lower performance or cost more 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to successfully compete against similar products developed internally by our oems or against their financial and other resources 
if we cannot compete successfully against our oems internally developed products  our business may be harmed 
if we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees  we may not be able to develop products or meet demand for our products in a timely fashion we depend upon skilled employees  such as software and hardware engineers  quality assurance engineers and other technical professionals 
we are located in the silicon valley where competition among companies to hire engineering and technical professionals is intense 
it is difficult for us to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and for us to retain these people 
there are many technology companies located nearby that may try to hire our employees 
the movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees 
if we do not offer competitive compensation  we may not be able to recruit or retain employees 
if we cannot successfully hire and retain employees  we may not be able to develop products timely or to meet demand for our products in a timely fashion and our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors  which could adversely affect our stock price we expect our stock price to vary with our operating results and  consequently  adverse fluctuations in operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
operating results may fluctuate due to o varying demand for our products  o success and timing of new product introductions  o changes in interest rates and availability of bank or financing credit to consumers of digital copiers and printers  o price reductions by us and our competitors  o delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders  o product performance  o availability of key components  including possible delays in deliveries from suppliers  o the status of our relationships with our oem partners  o the performance of third party manufacturers  o the status of our relationships with our key suppliers  o the financial and operational condition of oem partners and key suppliers o potential excess or shortage of skilled employees  and o general economic conditions 
many or our products  and the related oem copiers and printers  are purchased utilizing lease contracts or bank financing 
if prospective purchasers of digital copiers and printers are unable to obtain credit  or interest rate changes make credit terms undesirable  this may significantly reduce the demand for digital copiers and printers  negatively impacting our revenues and operating results 
typically we do not have long term volume purchase contracts with our customers  and a substantial portion of our backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less 
our customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times for product they have ordered from us without penalty 
however  a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in advance  and we plan these expenditures based on the sales forecasts from our oem customers and product development programs 
if we were unable to adjust our operating expenses in response to a shortfall in our sales  it could harm our quarterly financial results 
we attempt to hire additional employees to match growth in projected demand for our products 
if we project a higher demand than materializes  we will hire too many employees and incur expenses that we need not have incurred and our financial results may be lower 
if we project a lower demand than materializes  we will hire too few employees  we may not be able to meet demand for our products and our sales revenue may be lower 
if we cannot successfully manage our growth  our results of operations may be harmed 
the value of our investment portfolio will decrease if interest rates increase we have an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available for sale securities 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure to interest rate risk by investing primarily in short term securities 
we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations and this may cause our investment portfolio to decrease in value 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile our common stock  and the stock market generally  have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for securities of technology companies have been especially volatile  and fluctuations in the stock market are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our common stock price may also be affected by the factors discussed in this section as well as o fluctuations in our results of operations  revenues or earnings or those of our competitors  o failure of results of operations  revenues or earnings to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  o changes in stock market analysts recommendations regarding us  o real or perceived technological advances by our competitors  o financial performance of oem partners and key suppliers  o political or economic instability in regions where our products are sold or used  and o general market and economic conditions 
we face risks from our international operations and from currency fluctuations approximately of our revenue from the sale of products for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   came from sales outside north america  primarily to europe and japan 
we expect that sales to international destinations will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue 
you should be aware that we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations 
these risks include the regulatory requirements of foreign governments which may apply to our products  as well as requirements for export licenses which may be required for the export of certain technologies 
the necessary export licenses may be delayed or difficult to obtain  which could cause a delay in our international sales and hurt our product revenue 
other risks include trade protection measures  natural disasters  and political or economic conditions in a specific country or region 
we believe that economic conditions in other parts of the world  such as brazil and japan  may also limit demand for our products 
the move to a single european currency  the euro  and the resulting central bank management of interest rates to maintain fixed currency exchange rates among the member nations may lead to economic conditions which adversely impact sales of our products 
given the significance of our export sales to our total product revenue  we face a continuing risk from the substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  the euro and other major european currencies  and numerous southeast asian currencies  which could cause lower unit demand and the necessity that we lower average selling prices for our products because of the reduced strength of local currencies 
either of these events could harm our revenues and gross margin 
although we typically invoice our customers in us dollars  when we do invoice our customers in local currencies  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates between the currency of the invoice and the us dollar 
we attempt to limit or hedge these exposures through operational strategies and financial market instruments where we consider it appropriate 
to date we have mostly used forward contracts to reduce our risk from interest rate and currency fluctuations 
however  our efforts to reduce the risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements  and licensing and cross licensing arrangements to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
we have patent applications pending in the united states and in various foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from these pending applications or from any future applications  or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot be certain that any patents that may be issued to us  or which we license from third parties  or any other of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents  licenses or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information 
from time to time  litigation may be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources 
we face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation third parties may claim that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights 
such claims could result in lengthy and expensive litigation 
such claims and any related litigation  whether or not we are successful in the litigation  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we cannot guarantee that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
seasonal purchasing patterns of our oem customers have historically caused lower fourth quarter revenue  which may negatively impact the stock price our results of operations have typically followed a seasonal pattern reflecting the buying patterns of our large oem customers 
in the past  our fiscal fourth quarter the quarter ending december results have been adversely affected because some or all of our oem customers wanted to decrease  or otherwise delay  fourth quarter orders 
in addition  the first fiscal quarter traditionally has been a weaker quarter because our oem partners focus on training of their sales forces 
the primary reasons for this seasonal pattern are o fluctuation in demand for our products from our oem customers  who have historically sought to minimize year end inventory investment including the reduction in demand following introductory channel fill purchases 
fluctuation in demand is also caused by timing of new product releases and training by our oem partners  and o the fact that our oem partners have typically achieved their yearly sales goals during the fourth quarter and consequently delayed further purchases into the next fiscal year  and the fact that we do not know when the oems reach these sales goals as they generally do not share them with us 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful  and you should not rely on such comparisons to predict our future performance 
we anticipate that future operating results may fluctuate significantly due to this seasonal demand pattern 
we may make acquisitions and acquisitions involve numerous financial risks we seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources 
as part of this effort  we may make  and have in the past made  acquisitions of other companies or other companies technology assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following o difficulties in integration of operations  technologies  or products  o risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions  o possible write downs of impaired assets  and o potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not harm our business  operating results  financial condition  or stock price 
we may incur losses on our equity investments 
we recently announced the creation of a fund to invest in the equity securities of privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose a substantial part of or our entire initial investment in these companies 
the location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes  floods or other natural disasters our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development facilities and manufacturing operations  are located in the san francisco bay area of northern california  an area known for seismic activity 
this area has also experienced flooding in the past 
in addition  many of the components necessary to supply our products are purchased from suppliers subject to risk from natural disasters  based in areas including the san francisco bay area  taiwan  and japan 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or a flood  could harm our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we are dependent on sub contractors to manufacture and deliver products to our customers we subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products 
we are totally reliant on the ability of our subcontractors to produce products to be sold to our customers  and while we closely monitor our subcontractors performance we cannot assure you that such subcontractors will continue to produce our products in a timely and effective manner 
we also can not assure you that difficulties experienced by our subcontractors such as interruptions in a subcontractor s ability to make or ship our products  or fix quality assurance problems would not harm our business  operating results  or financial condition 
if we decide to change subcontractors we could experience delays in setting up new subcontractors which would result in delay in delivery of our products 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
foreign exchange contracts during the company utilized forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
the transactions hedged were intercompany accounts receivable and payable between the company and its japanese subsidiary 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the reporting periods of the hedged transactions 
foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances and the offsetting losses and gains on forward foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income statement 
as of december   the company had one outstanding forward foreign exchange contract to sell yen equivalent to approximately million with an expiration date of january  the estimated fair value of the foreign currency contract represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices 
as of december   the difference between the fair value of the outstanding contract and the contract amount was immaterial 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase of the amount of yen to purchase one us dollar 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate for this currency would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since the contract hedges foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contract would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
interest rate risk the fair value of the company s cash portfolio at december   approximated carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from an instantaneous hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates for any debt instruments in the company s investment portfolio 
as of december   the company s cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio includes debt securities of million subject to interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of fair value of approximately million 
the fair value of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   and equaled the carrying value 
the company s long term debt requires interest payments based on a variable rate and therefore its fair value is not subject to interest rate risk
