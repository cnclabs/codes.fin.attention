item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in this section  we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition 
we also make some statements relating to the future which are called forward looking statements 
although we do our best to make clear and accurate forward looking statements  the actual results and outcomes could be significantly different from those that we discuss in this document 
for this reason  you should not rely too heavily on these forward looking statements 
we encourage you to read the risk factors section below  where we discuss these statements in more detail 
general the majority of our operating revenues  operating expenses and net income are derived from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds  institutional  high net worth and private accounts  and other investment products 
this is our primary business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we advise  collectively called our sponsored investment products  are distributed to the public globally via five distinct names franklin templeton mutual series bissett fiduciary our sponsored investment products include a broad range of domestic and global international equity  balanced  fixed income  sector and money market mutual funds  as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions 
in fiscal  we broadened our product lines with funds currently offered by two companies 
in october  the acquisition of bissett and associates investment management ltd 
bissett  added funds to our canadian product line  primarily in the balanced and growth asset classes 
it also brought a number of institutional and private clients to the group 
in april  we completed the acquisition of fiduciary trust company international fiduciary  a global investment management organization providing services to institutions and private clients through its bank and trust charters 
the level of our revenues is largely dependent upon the level and relative composition of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues are also dependent on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts between our subsidiary entities and our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business activity and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals and corporations and consumer lending 
at september   we employed over  people in countries  serving customers on six different continents 
assets under management in billions as of september  vs vs equity global international domestic us total equity hybrid fixed income tax free taxable domestic global international total fixed income money total simple monthly average for the year investment management fees from approximately of our assets under management at september  are calculated using daily average assets under management 
our assets under management at the end of fiscal were billion  higher than the prior fiscal year end 
the simple monthly average value of these assets during fiscal was billion as compared to billion in fiscal  a increase 
the change in simple monthly average assets under management is generally more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the period end change year over year 
the following table shows the relative composition of assets under management 
as of september  percentage of total assets under management equity fixed income hybrid money total the change in the composition of assets under management was largely due to the inclusion of the fiduciary assets under management in fiscal and the market depreciation in equity assets 
approximately of fiduciary s assets under management were classified as hybrid assets at the time of acquisition in april this change in mix had the additional effect of lowering our effective fee rate on assets managed as a greater percentage of assets under management are in the fixed income and hybrid categories which generally carry a lower management fee than equity assets 
the change in our assets under management was as follows 
in billions year ended september  vs vs beginning assets under management sales reinvested dividends redemptions acquisitions  depreciation appreciation n a ending assets under management the acquisitions of bissett in october and fiduciary in april increased our assets under management by and billion  respectively 
during fiscal  our sponsored investment products experienced overall net cash inflows  including reinvested dividends  in contrast to the net cash outflows experienced in fiscal and gross product sales increased while redemptions decreased 
we experienced sales increases in the fixed income  hybrid  and money market products which more than offset a decline in equity product sales 
the chart below summarizes changes in assets by product class 
in billions global domestic hybrid tax free taxable money total year ended september  international equity income fixed funds equity income beginning assets under management sales reinvested dividends redemptions acquisitions depreciation appreciation ending assets under management global domestic hybrid tax free taxable money total year ended september  international equity income fixed funds equity income beginning assets under management sales reinvested dividends redemptions acquisitions appreciation depreciation ending assets under management despite a relative improvement in the investment performance of our sponsored investment products  we experienced market depreciation in fiscal  mainly in the final quarter of the year  as a result of an overall decline in domestic and global equity markets 
the market depreciation led to the decline in assets under management absent the addition of the bissett and fiduciary acquisitions 
in fiscal and fiscal  net outflows were offset by market appreciation thereby allowing our ending assets under management to grow by in both years 
results of operations the table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years 
in millions except per share amounts vs vs net income earnings per common share basic diluted without restructuring charge operating margin as reported without restructuring charge ebitda margin as reported without restructuring charge ebitda margin is earnings before interest  taxes on income  depreciation and the amortization of intangibles divided by total revenues 
net income and diluted earnings per share decreased by and respectively in fiscal slightly higher revenue and investment income this fiscal year over the prior fiscal year were offset by higher operating expenses resulting from cost increases in distribution  compensation and benefits  information systems  technology and occupancy  advertising and intangibles amortization 
earnings per share in fiscal decreased from the prior year primarily due to decreased net income and an increase in the number of the company s shares outstanding  primarily resulting from the fiduciary acquisition which was paid for through the issuance of company stock 
net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal increased by and  respectively  principally as a result of increased investment management fee revenue from increased average assets under management  higher investment income  and lower operating costs driven predominantly from the restructuring charge taken in fiscal the table below presents the percentage change in each category between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal operating revenues as a percentage of total revenues vs vs investment management fees underwriting and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees other  net total operating revenues summary in fiscal  total operating revenues increased over the prior year 
the acquisition of fiduciary in april provided higher investment management fees from higher average assets under management  despite lower effective fee rates resulting from the change in the mix of assets under management  and increased banking revenues included in other  net 
these increases were offset by a decrease in shareholder servicing revenue  resulting from a decline in shareholder billable accounts year over year 
in fiscal  total operating revenues increased due primarily to increased simple monthly average assets under management and shareholder servicing fee increases 
investment management fees investment management fees  accounting for of our operating revenues in fiscal  include both investment advisory and business management fees 
these fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management 
annual rates vary by product  region and investment objective and  in certain instances  decline as the average net assets of the individual portfolios exceed certain threshold levels 
in return for these fees  we provide investment advisory  administrative and other management services 
investment management fees increased in fiscal  primarily due to the fiduciary acquisition  which increased the simple monthly average assets under management in the latter half of the fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by a shift in our asset mix toward lower management fee fixed income and hybrid investment products 
this shift toward fixed income and hybrid investment products led to a decrease in our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management in fiscal the effective investment management fee rate declined to for the fiscal year compared to in fiscal in the latest quarter  the effective fee rate reflects the full impact of the current change in asset mix and was calculated as 
in fiscal  investment management fees increased  primarily due to higher simple monthly average assets under management 
underwriting and distribution fees underwriting commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products that have a sales commission paid at the time of purchase 
distribution fees are paid by our sponsored investment products in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
while other contractual arrangements exist in other locations  in the united states  distribution fees include b plan fees  which are subject to maximum pay out levels based upon a percentage of the assets in each fund 
a significant portion of underwriting commissions and distribution fees are paid to the brokers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the investing public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees remained constant in fiscal  despite a increase in product sales 
sales at reduced or zero commissions are offered on certain classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts 
thus  as the mix of sales change  so will our commission revenue 
commission revenues remained constant with the prior year due to a greater percentage of sales at no or lower commission levels offsetting the sales increase in fiscal distribution fees also remained consistent with the prior fiscal year as the increase in simple average assets under management was largely caused by the fiduciary acquisition 
the fiduciary assets under management are not subject to distribution fees  therefore  these assets did not affect distribution fee income as would be expected with a year over year increase in average assets under management 
we experienced similar trends in fiscal where underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal  despite a increase in product sales 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered  although some funds are charged fees based on the level of assets under management 
fees are received as compensation for providing transfer agency services which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service and tax reporting 
in the us  transfer agency services agreements provide that closed accounts in a given calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate 
in canada  the agreements provide that accounts closed in the previous calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the split of total billable accounts between open and closed accounts  the date on which accounts are no longer billable  and the growth in new accounts 
shareholder servicing fees decreased during fiscal as a result of a decrease in the total number of billable accounts 
in fiscal  shareholder servicing fees increased over fiscal this was due to increased fees from funds whose servicing fees are based on assets under management and increases in the per account charge  partially offset by a decrease in the average number of billable accounts for the fiscal year 
other  net other  net consists primarily of revenues from the banking finance operating segment and custody services related to fiduciary 
revenues from the banking finance operating segment include operating revenues  consisting primarily of interest income on loans  servicing income  and investment income on banking finance investment securities  which are offset by interest expense  and the provision for anticipated loan losses 
other  net increased in fiscal this increase was principally due to the addition of the fiduciary banking and custody activities from the date of acquisition to those of franklin templeton bank and trust  fsb and franklin capital corporation 
other  net remained relatively constant during fiscal securitization of a portion of the auto loan portfolio in march resulted in a loss that was offset by revenues from the residual portfolio 
in january  we sold auto loans receivable with a net book value of million 
the gross sales proceeds of this securitization  including interest and before underwriting discount  were million 
a gain of million has been recorded on the transaction 
operating expenses as a percentage of total expenses vs vs underwriting and distribution compensation and benefits information systems  technology and occupancy advertising and promotion amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of intangible assets other restructuring charges n a n a september  expense  net n a n a total operating expenses summary operating expenses increased during fiscal primarily caused by increased compensation and benefits  information systems  technology and occupancy costs  the addition of the operating costs of fiduciary  increased underwriting and distribution expenses and increased amortization of intangible assets 
in fiscal  operating expenses decreased primarily due to the restructuring charge of fiscal underwriting and distribution underwriting and distribution includes sales commissions and distribution fees paid to brokers and other third parties for selling  distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products 
during fiscal  underwriting and distribution expenses increased 
total sales increased in fiscal by  but a significant number of those additional sales were at a low or zero commission rate  resulting in a smaller proportional increase in the commissions paid to intermediaries in fiscal compared to fiscal distribution fee expense was consistent with the prior fiscal year distribution expense 
we experienced similar trends in fiscal compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of approximately fiduciary employees from the date of acquisition  retention bonuses for fiduciary employees  annual salary increases  and an increase in employee benefit and recruiting costs 
salary awards are normally given annually in october and are based upon the performance of the individual employee 
the number of employees at september  was more than  as compared to the approximately  at the same time last year 
compensation and benefits increased in fiscal  primarily due to annual salary increases awarded in october and market adjustments awarded throughout fiscal for certain employees  partially offset by a decrease in the average employee headcount during fiscal as compared to fiscal in order to hire and retain our key employees  we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive  which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenues at certain points in our growth cycle 
information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal this increase was primarily due to continued expenditure on new technology initiatives  an investment in the technology infrastructure of the company  the charges and costs in connection with ibm s assumption of the management of our data center and distributed server operations  and the added technology and occupancy costs of the fiduciary acquisition 
during the past year  we embarked on a number of hardware upgrades  purchased  developed and installed new software applications  re engineered our technology infrastructure and global network architecture  replaced or upgraded older versions of software applications  and developed e business strategies to improve our service levels  work environment and productivity 
we expect that similar activities will continue to impact our overall expenditures through fiscal and beyond  as the organization looks to technology and process enhancement to improve efficiency  lower costs and add capacity as our business continues to expand globally 
we also experienced an increase in occupancy costs related to our expansion in asia  canada  and europe as well as costs related to the relocation to our new worldwide headquarters in san mateo  california 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal this increase was not indicative of the actual increase in technology expenses  as we significantly increased our expenditure on technology initiatives in fiscal however  that increase was offset by a decrease in year expenses and increased capitalization of technology costs following the adoption of a new accounting rule 
in addition  during fiscal  we incurred slightly higher occupancy costs related to our site consolidation efforts  new facilities and the pending relocation to our san mateo worldwide headquarters 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs were as follows 
in thousands net book value at beginning of period    additions during period  net of disposals and other adjustments    net assets acquired through acquisitions  amortization during period    net book value at end of period    advertising and promotion advertising and promotion increased during fiscal this increase resulted primarily from increased promotion and advertising activity in the latter half of the fiscal year to assist in educating the sales channels and the investing public about the strong relative investment performance of our sponsored investment products during the year 
advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal due primarily to cost efficiencies associated with printing and marketing material production expenditures 
amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease was principally as a result of the financing arrangements described below 
certain fund classes  namely class b  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  while  at the same time  our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission to selling brokers and other intermediaries 
similarly  class a shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when certain minimum investment criteria are met  yet our us distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale 
we have arranged to finance certain deferred commission assets dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations through lightning finance company limited lfl  a company in which we have an ownership interest 
dca that are recorded on our balance sheet  principally consisting of commissions arising from the sale of class a  b and c shares sold in the us  including dca financed through lfl  are amortized 
as a result of the arrangement with lfl  all canadian and european dca are no longer recorded in our financial statements 
generally  us dca sold to lfl under the us agreement are retained in our financial statements since they are not considered sold under this agreement until resold by lfl  which occurs at least once annually 
during fiscal  we sold or financed sales commissions globally totaling million to lfl  compared to million in fiscal other income expense investment and other income is comprised primarily of dividends from investments in our sponsored mutual funds interest income from investments in bonds and government securities realized gains and losses on investments foreign currency exchange gains and losses other miscellaneous income  including gain or loss on disposal of company property other income expense increased in fiscal  primarily due to higher realized gains 
during fiscal  we recognized net realized gains of approximately million from the sale of certain sponsored investment products held by the company for investment 
in addition  other realized gains of million were recognized related to the sale of our headquarters building in san mateo 
investment income increased in fiscal  due to higher average available cash balances to invest  higher interest rates  and greater realized gains 
interest expense decreased in fiscal this decrease was mainly due to the relatively low interest rate of on the convertible notes issued in may  the redemption of outstanding commercial paper  and generally lower interest rates in fiscal interest expense decreased in fiscal following a reduction in our average outstanding debt during the fiscal year 
taxes on income our effective income tax rate for fiscal and remained constant at on an annual basis compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate will continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at september  liquid assets  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  investments available for sale and current receivables increased to  million at september  from  million at september  at september   approximately million was available to us under unused commercial paper and medium term note programs 
in addition  in fiscal we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission permitting the issuance of debt and equity securities of up to million 
our revolving credit facilities at september  totaled million  of which  million was under a day facility 
the remaining million facility will expire in may we also have million available in uncommitted bank lines under the federal reserve funds system 
cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due mainly to lower operating income resulting from higher operating expenses offsetting a small increase in operating revenues 
during fiscal  we used a total of million for investing activities  including million related to the purchase of investments  net of liquidations  million in connection with the banking finance segment  and million primarily related to the fiduciary and bissett acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million as net debt issued of approximately million exceeded other uses of cash in financing activities  including stock repurchases of million 
outstanding debt increased to million at september  compared to million at september  after may  debt consists primarily of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes carry a yield to maturity of per annum to maturity 
prior to may  debt primarily consisted of commercial paper that carried interest at variable rates and fixed interest medium term notes 
during the quarter ended june   our remaining commercial paper was redeemed 
other long term debt totaling million has various maturity dates through fiscal and thereafter 
we had previously entered into a series of agreements to finance the construction of a new corporate headquarters on a acre site in san mateo  california 
an owner lessor trust was set up to finance the construction and lease the completed facility 
the construction was completed and we moved into our new headquarters in fiscal the lease agreement is not expected to impact our cash flows or financial condition materially during the initial five year lease period 
we have arranged with lfl for non recourse financing of sales commissions advanced on sales of our b shares globally 
the cumulative sales commissions that we have financed through lfl since inception approximated million at september  we expect that the principal uses of cash will be to increase assets under management through expansion of our business  make strategic acquisitions  fund property and equipment acquisitions  pay operating expenses of the business  enhance our technology infrastructure  improve our business processes  pay shareholder dividends  repay and service debt  and acquire shares of the company 
we expect to finance future increases in investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  or through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities 
we believe that our existing liquid assets  together with the expected continuing cash flow from operations  our borrowing capacity under current credit facilities  our ability to issue debt or equity securities and our sales commission financing arrangement will be sufficient to meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs 
risk factors forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  words or phrases about the future such as expected to  will continue  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of statements about our future cash needs  our anticipated uses of cash  the expected sources of future cash inflows  and the anticipated costs related to the september  tragedy  are also forward looking statements 
these types of statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  such as the factors described in the risk factors outlined below 
these risks and uncertainties could cause our current expectations and predictions in the forward looking statements to be wrong 
forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made  and you should not rely on them 
rather  you should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk disclosures in this annual report 
if a circumstance occurs that causes any of our forward looking statements to be inaccurate  we have no obligation to publicly announce the change in our expectations  or to revise the forward looking statements 
we face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with numerous investment management companies  stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions 
continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own 
additionally  competing securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products  which could limit the distribution of our investment products 
to the extent that existing or potential customers  including securities dealers  decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors  the sales of our products as well as our market share  revenues and net income could decline 
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 
we derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker dealers and other similar investment advisors 
increasing competition for these distribution channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future 
higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings 
additionally  if one of the major financial advisors who distribute our products were to cease their operations  it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
moreover  our failure to maintain strong business relationships with these advisors would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products  which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management  related revenues and overall business and financial condition 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the global equity markets 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global equity markets due to the recent terrorist attacks 
declines in these markets have caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our revenue and income 
the levels of our assets under management  which in turn impact revenues  are subject to significant fluctuations 
global economic conditions  changes in the equity market place  interest rates  inflation rates  the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix  market values  and levels of our assets under management 
changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income  since we derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage 
similarly  our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation 
we face risks associated with conducting operations in numerous foreign countries 
we sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world  and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally 
regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets 
our inability to meet cash needs could have a negative effect on our financial condition and business operations 
our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value  our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock 
similarly  our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables  and to obtain continued financing for class b shares  is also subject to the market s perception of those assets  finance rates offered by competitors  and the general market for private debt 
if we are unable to obtain these funds and financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plan 
we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 
our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified employees  our overall business condition and revenues could suffer 
our emerging market portfolios and related revenues are vulnerable to market specific political and economic risks 
our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability  changes in governmental polices  expropriation  nationalization  asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership 
foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile than the us and other established markets 
diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans 
we compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans  which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales 
our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business 
economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans  which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase 
the september  world trade center tragedy may adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefits we expect from the recent acquisition of fiduciary 
the september  tragedy at the world trade center resulted in the destruction of our fiduciary headquarters  loss of of our employees  additional operating expenses to re establish and relocate our operations  and asset write offs  all of which could adversely affect or delay our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition 
overcoming this tragedy and achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend on close collaboration between management and key personnel of the two companies in a timely and efficient manner 
the fiduciary acquisition could adversely affect our combined financial results or the market price of our common stock 
if the benefits of the acquisition over time do not exceed the costs associated with the acquisition  including the costs arising from the september  tragedy and any dilution to our shareholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition  our financial results  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected 
we are subject to federal reserve board regulation 
upon completion of our acquisition of fiduciary  we became a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of the federal reserve board may impose limitations  restrictions  or prohibitions on our activities if the federal reserve board believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition  and the federal reserve board may take actions as appropriate to enforce applicable federal law 
technology and operating risk could constrain our operations 
we are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology  operating systems and premises 
although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans  we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters  power failures  acts of war  and third party failures  which could negatively impact our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk the potential loss due to changes in the value of investments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange and or equity prices 
management is responsible for managing this risk 
we have also established a risk management committee to provide a framework to assist management to identify  assess and manage market and other risks 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily in our debt transactions and portfolio debt holdings available for sale  which are carried at fair value 
as of september   a significant percentage of our outstanding debt is at fixed interest rates 
in our banking finance segment  we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets and funding sources 
in addition  we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance segment  our outstanding debt and portfolio debt holdings  individually and collectively  of a basis point movement in market interest rates 
we do not expect this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario 
we operate primarily in the united states  but also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe  asia  south america  africa and australia 
the majority of these revenues and associated expenses  however  are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not material at this time 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states 
we are exposed to equity price fluctuations 
investments available for sale are carried at fair value 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain a diversified investment portfolio
