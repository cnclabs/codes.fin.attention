on september   penton entered into a credit agreement with several banks under which it can borrow up to million 
the agreement provided for a revolving credit facility of up to million  a long term loan of million term loan a and a long term loan of million term loan b 
the proceeds of this credit agreement were used to repay penton s debt outstanding under the million credit facility obtained when penton purchased internet world media  inc iwm 
at december   penton had million outstanding under its term loans and million available under its revolving credit facility 
see note debt for additional information 
on april   penton amended its credit agreement to give the company the flexibility to sell assets of up to million and the ability to monetize the company s joint venture investments 
on october   penton amended its credit agreement to give the company the option to increase  in the aggregate  its term loan a  term loan b and or its revolver by million

based upon current and anticipated levels of operations  management believes that cash on hand and cash flow from operations  combined with borrowings available under penton s credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable penton to meet current and anticipated cash operating requirements  including scheduled interest and principal payments  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
however  actual capital requirements may change  particularly as a result of any acquisitions that penton may make 
penton s ability to meet current and anticipated operating requirements will depend upon its future performance  which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond penton s control 
depending on the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions  penton may be required to raise additional capital through additional financing arrangements or the issuance of private or public debt or equity securities 
management cannot assure that such additional financing will be available at acceptable terms 
substantially all of penton s debt bears interest at floating rates 
therefore  penton s liquidity and financial condition are  and will continue to be  affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
seasonality the introduction of trade shows and conferences into penton s product mix through the acquisition of index and isoa in late  the acquisition of iwm in november  the acquisition of new hope in may and the acquisition of streaming media in september has changed the seasonal pattern of revenue and profit because all five companies have pronounced seasonal patterns in their businesses 
the majority of the trade shows of isoa  streaming media and iwm are held in the second and fourth quarters and  accordingly  the majority of their revenue is recognized in these quarters 
furthermore  the majority of the index shows historically have been held in the fourth quarter  and the new hope shows have been held in the first and third or fourth quarters 
accordingly  these acquisitions have had and will have a positive impact on revenue and profit for these quarters 
penton also may experience seasonal fluctuations as trade shows and conferences held in one period in the current year may be held in a different period in future years 
inflation the impact of inflation on penton s results of operations has not been significant in recent years 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
penton was required to adopt this statement in the first quarter of in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas 
sfas deferred the effective date of adoption of sfas to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas was subsequently amended by sfas accounting for certain derivative and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
penton is required to adopt this statement effective january  even though penton has entered into interest rate cap  collar and swap agreements  management does not believe that these statements  when adopted  will have a material impact on penton s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provided guidance on applying existing generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
the company adopted sab during the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company 
euro conversion on january   of the participating countries that are members of the european union established a new uniform currency known as the euro 
the currency existing prior to such date in the participating countries will be phased out during the transition period commencing january   and ending january  during this transition period  both the euro and the existing currency will be available in the participating countries 
although penton generates revenues in some of the participating countries  management does not anticipate that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect penton s business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
penton does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the normal course of business  penton manages fluctuations in interest rates through interest rate derivative agreements and  at a minimum  hedges of the current outstanding term loans maintained as floating rate borrowings 
penton s objective in managing this exposure is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates 
see note fair value of financial instruments 
penton maintains assets and operations in europe and asia  and as a result  may be exposed to cost increases relative to the markets in which it sells 
for  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of foreign countries in which penton operates created only an immaterial impact on its financial results
