item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leader in the development of intuitive interface devices for a variety of home and business applications 
we were incorporated in california in february and reincorporated in delaware in july from to  we developed and refined our force sensing resistor  or fsr  technology and sold it to customers for electronic  musical  medical and other applications  which we now refer to as the specialty components market 
in  we introduced our first branded computer pointing device  portapoint  and in  we introduced our first wireless pointing device  remotepoint 
with the advent of this latter device  we established ourselves as a leading supplier to oems in the computerized presentation system market  which we now call the business communications market 
in  we introduced the epad product for e transactions applications and intuitouch technology for the home entertainment market 
revenue  net of allowances for returns and warranty  is recognized upon shipment of product 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned 
revenues have increased steadily during the last six years as we have established ourselves in new markets and built a base of oem customers in the computer  computer peripheral and business communications industry 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  varies depending on product and licensing revenue mix 
product development and research expenditures  which includes engineering  contract engineering and development and material costs of development  have generally increased as revenue has increased but has remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain a leadership position in existing markets and to develop new ones 
selling  general and administrative expense  which includes sales  marketing and administrative personnel  advertising  sales commissions  reseller incentives  tradeshow costs and other sales expenses  declined through  stabilized in  as a percentage of sales  reflecting the amortization of a relatively fixed expense requirement over a larger revenue base 
because of net operating loss carryforwards available both for our us based and japan based operations  we historically have not paid income tax 
beginning in  some of these loss carryforwards began to expire or became fully utilized  therefore income taxes are expected to increase on both a percentage and absolute dollar basis 
other income expense was significant in and as the result of a non recurring legal settlement expense and the cancelled offering cost 
prior to  operations was a net user of cash and we funded this through existing cash balances  private placements of equity and to a lesser extent  bank and lease financing 
in  operations was a net provider of cash  generating million and was essentially break even in sales of business communications intuitive interface devices accounted for of our total sales in and of our total sales in the three years ended december  our business communications sales in dollars grew at an average annualized rate of in because our market share for business communications interface devices is approximately  we expect that our ability to achieve further revenue growth in this market will largely depend on growth in the market itself 
we have established relationships with most of the major oems in the business communications market 
many of these oems are based in japan and approximately of our revenues came from japanese customers 
as a result we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we have licensed certain technology related to the production of fsr sensors to international electronics and engineering  a former affiliate based in luxembourg  for use in connection with sales of sensors to the automotive industry 
we are entitled to royalties in connection with sales of automotive sensors outside europe 
we have occasionally licensed other aspects of our technology in connection with the settlement of intellectual property disputes and expect to continue to do so in the future 
in june and june  the aicpa issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
and required its adoption beginning january  we adopted this standard in january  however  we do not expect its implementation to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues gross profit operating expenses product development and research selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense income tax net income fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  revenues increased from million in to million in this revenue growth is a result primarily of growth in sales to the business communications market and  to a lesser extent  from a twofold increase in home entertainment sales to million reflecting our initial penetration of that market 
gross profit as a percent of sales improved to in from in due to growth in home entertainment and million in licensing revenues 
product development and research expense increased from million in to million in while increasing marginally as a percentage of sales 
the increase reflects our continuing commitment to develop products that will support our leadership position in our existing and targeted markets 
selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of sales from in to in 
the percentage increase reflects the creation of sales and marketing teams for the home entertainment and e transaction markets

operating income was million and net income was million in  the increases over were primarily attributable to increased sales 
fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december revenues increased from million in to million in this revenue growth is a result primarily of growth in sales to the business communications market and  to a lesser extent  from a threefold increase in home entertainment sales to million reflecting our initial penetration of that market 
gross profit as a percent of sales did not change appreciably 
product development and research expense increased from million in to million in while increasing marginally as a percentage of sales 
the increase reflects our continuing commitment to develop products that will support our leadership position in our existing and targeted markets

income taxes were significant for the first time in at  as our japanese subsidiary fully utilized its tax loss carryforwards and began to accrue tax on income 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of revenue 
we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to fairly present the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter

operations was essentially break even from a cash standpoint in as compared to a cash provider of million in our growth into two new business sectors as well as the inventory investment required for the transition to a new contract manufacturer resulted in the cash flow difference 
we spent  in and  in to purchase additional manufacturing equipment and computer equipment related to our internal computer network 
we invested  in new patents in and  in we have a maximum amount available under our japanese bank line of credit to million  none of which was used as of december  our us line of credit was unused at december  and had million of availability as of that date 
we have a million equipment lease line  unused at december  the exercise of outstanding stock options is a potential source of equity capital that may be available to us 
we believe that our current cash balances and lines of credit will allow us to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  an unforeseen downturn of results in sufficient magnitude could adversely affect our ability to meet that forecast 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our japanese subsidiary  interlink electronics kk  generally transacts its sales and collects its accounts receivable in japanese yen 
to hedge these revenues against future movements in exchange rates  we will from time to time purchase foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains or losses on the forward contracts are then offset by gains or losses on the underlying exposure and consequently a sudden or significant change of foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on net income or cash flows to the extent future revenues are protected by forward currency contracts 
during  the company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in the normal course of business to manage its exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
the principle objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and costs associated with financial and global operating activities 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of million 
during fiscal  the company recognized  of gains on foreign currency exchange contracts which is reflected in income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
