item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the corporation for the three years ended december  and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
differences from united states gaap are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  and  the corporation s primary mining operation and principal source of earnings was the hycroft mine in nevada  which began gold production in in december  mining activities were suspended at the hycroft mine 
gold processing and recovery continued from previously mined ore in and and is expected to continue in  with gold production for estimated to be in excess of  ounces 
on december   mineral ridge inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  voluntarily filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code after the mineral ridge mine failed to meet minimum cash flow levels required under mineral ridge inc s loan with dresdner bank due to ore reserve deficiencies and low gold prices 
the loan was not guaranteed by  and the lender has no recourse to  the corporation 
the corporation recognized no revenue  production or operating expenses at mineral ridge inc in the year results of operations compared with the net loss was million as compared to the net loss of million 
the net loss included a million write down of mineral properties and other assets and a million gain from sale of assets and marketable securities 
in  the net loss included a million write down of mineral properties 
excluding the write down of mineral properties and disposal of assets  the net loss of million decreased million from the loss of million 
the million decrease in net losses in was due to substantially lower operating costs partially offset by lower gold revenues  both of which reflect the corporation s lower gold production and operating levels in as compared to the corporation s average gross realized price declined in reflecting the absence of any benefit from forward sales 
gold sales of million in decreased million  or  from million in the decrease in gold sales was primarily because of lower gold production combined with the lower average gold price realized by the corporation 
average gross realized price average spot price gold sales s   gold production ounces   gold production decreased  ounces from  in to  ounces in the decrease in gold production was attributable to the closure of the mineral ridge mine in and the progressive depletion of recoverable gold in the leach pads at the hycroft mine 
gold production from the two mines was as follows 
ounces hycroft mine   mineral ridge mine  total gold production   there was no ore mined at the hycroft mine in all gold production from the hycroft mine was from previously mined ore 
operating costs from mining operations decreased million from million in to million in mining  processing and other costs accounted for million  million and million of the decrease in operating costs  respectfully 
the decrease was primarily due to the closure of the mineral ridge mine  and the progressive reduction of leach solution volume processed at the hycroft mine  with related reductions in manpower and in the consumption of reagents and electric power 
operating costs at the two mines were as follows 
in thousands hycroft mine   mineral ridge mine  total operating costs   the cash operating cost per ounce at the two mines was as follows 
per ounce hycroft mine mineral ridge mine cash operating costs mining costs in were zero due to the closure of the mineral ridge mine in and the prior suspension of mining activity at the hycroft mine in processing costs  including changes in inventory  decreased million in due to the closure of the mineral ridge mine in and the progressive reduction in the volume of leach solution processed at the hycroft mine during the year 
the corporation processed no newly mined ore in the year processing activities at the hycroft mine continued throughout the year as previously mined ore was treated for gold extraction 
other operating costs including mine administration  refining and freight costs  and silver credits decreased million in excluding silver credits  other operating costs decreased million reflecting the closure of the mineral ridge mine in and a reduced operating level at the hycroft mine 
however  lower silver production and sales offset million of the decrease 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a in of million decreased million from million in at the hycroft mine  dd a decreased million and was a result of the write down of certain depreciable assets in the prior year and the sale of assets including crushing and conveying equipment during the year 
dd a at the mineral ridge mine decreased million to nil as a result of the bankruptcy of mineral ridge inc in the corporation did not have any major equipment leases 
mineral exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were million in as compared to million in the costs included million in holding costs for the corporation s bolivian properties as compared to million in the corporation incurred these holding costs while maintaining and protecting its property interests in bolivia 
also included in the costs were million for exploration and evaluation work and holding costs at the hycroft mine  and million of other exploration and evaluation expenditures 
corporate administration and investor relations costs were million in  unchanged from expenses included approximately million of one time expenses related to the closing of mineral ridge inc and merger and acquisition studies 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in  reflecting the corporation s lower average debt balance during the year 
the decrease in the average debt balance was directly related to the bankruptcy of mineral ridge inc and paying down of debt at the hycroft mine 
in  the gain on the sale of assets and marketable securities was million 
there was no similar gain or loss from the disposal of assets in other income received in included insurance settlements totaling million 
there was no similar settlement in management regularly reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets and investments 
these evaluations indicated that the carrying values of certain properties and investments were overstated at december  and  accordingly  were written down to estimated recoverable amounts 
based upon management s evaluation  million was written down in  of this  million was related to the bolivian mineral properties and other bolivian assets and million was related to hycroft equipment 
million was written down in  including bolivian mineral properties million  mineral ridge mine net assets million  and zamora accounts receivable million 
additionally in  the corporation wrote off its remaining investment of million in zamora  reflecting its decreased levels of ownership and control 
income tax in was a  refund of canadian income tax  as compared to nil in compared with the net loss was million as compared to the net loss of million 
the net loss included a million write down of mineral properties 
there was no similar write down in the net loss included a one time gain on the liquidation of gold futures of million and a million gain from the disposal of assets  while there were no similar gains in excluding the write down of mineral properties and the gains from the liquidation of gold futures and disposal of assets  the net loss of million increased million from the loss of million 
the million increase in net losses in was due to substantially lower gold revenues partially offset by lower operating costs  both of which reflect the corporation s lower gold production and operating levels in as compared to the corporation s average gross realized price continued to decline in reflecting the lower average spot price of gold for gold sales of million in decreased million  or  from million in the decrease in gold sales was primarily due to lower gold production combined with the lower average gold prices realized by the corporation 
average gross realized price average spot price gold sales s   gold production ounces   gold production decreased  ounces from  in to  ounces in the decrease in gold production was attributable to the suspension of mining activities at the hycroft mine in  which was partially offset by the start up of mining activities at the mineral ridge mine in gold production from the two mines was as follows 
ounces hycroft mine   mineral ridge mine  total gold production   there was no ore mined at the hycroft mine in all gold production from the hycroft mine was from previously mined ore 
at the mineral ridge mine  million tons of ore were mined in  as compared to million tons of ore in the average grade of the ore mined in was ounces of gold per ton 
during the initial mining and processing start up activities at mineral ridge inc  various mechanical problems were encountered 
these problems  primarily in the crushing plant  inhibited the mine s ability to place ore onto the heaps for leaching and gold extraction 
as the mine continued to operate in  the mechanical problems were addressed and crusher production improved in the third quarter of to an average of  tons per month  which was in line with corporation s projections 
however  the mine then began to experience ore deficiencies during mining operations  as compared to original ore reserve estimates  and gold production failed to meet expectations 
operating costs from mining operations decreased million from million in to million in mining  processing and other costs accounted for million  million and million of the decrease in operating costs  respectfully 
the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of mining activities at the hycroft mine  which was partially offset by the commencement of mining activities at the mineral ridge mine 
operating costs at the two mines were as follows 
in thousands hycroft mine   mineral ridge mine  total operating costs   the cash operating cost per ounce at the two mines was as follows 
per ounce hycroft mine mineral ridge mine total operating costs the cash operating costs at the mineral ridge mine for the two months ended december  have been omitted because the mine was in the initial start up phase and  accordingly  it is not possible to accurately determine the true cash operating costs 
mining costs in decreased million as a result of mining fewer tons at a lower average cost per ton 
total tons mined  including waste tons  decreased to million tons in from million tons in the average cost per ton mined decreased to in  as compared to in in  inefficiencies associated with the reduction in mining activities at the hycroft mine resulted in a higher average mining cost per ton 
in  there was no mining at the hycroft mine and all mining activities occurred at the mineral ridge mine 
processing costs  including changes in inventory  decreased million in as a result of treating fewer tons of ore as compared to ore tons processed decreased to million tons in from million tons in at the hycroft mine  while no additional ore was placed on the heaps in  processing activities still continued throughout the year as previously mined ore was treated for gold extraction 
processing activities at the mineral ridge mine included placing and treating million tons of ore in other operating costs including mine administration  refining and freight costs  and silver credits decreased million in excluding silver credits  other operating costs decreased million reflecting the efficiencies of combining the administrative functions of the two mines and the corporation s efforts to minimize costs 
however  lower silver production and sales offset million of the million decrease 
dd a in of million decreased million from million in at the hycroft mine  dd a decreased million and was directly related to the suspension of mining activities in dd a at the mineral ridge mine increased million reflecting the start up of mining activities in the provision for reclamation and closure costs of million in decreased significantly from million in in  the higher provision compensated for the revised hycroft mine plan  which called for the reduction and subsequent suspension of mining activities in december in  the provision of million was solely from the mineral ridge mine 
operating lease costs in decreased to  as compared to million in during  the leases on several large pieces of mobile mining equipment terminated and the equipment was purchased at the end of the leases 
during  the corporation did not have any major equipment leases 
mineral exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were million in as compared to million in the costs included million in holding costs for the corporation s bolivian properties as compared to million in the corporation incurred these holding costs while maintaining and protecting its property interests in bolivia 
also included in the costs were million for exploration and evaluation work at the hycroft mine  million for exploration at the mineral ridge mine  and million of other exploration and evaluation expenditures 
corporate administration and investor relations decreased million in to million as the corporation continued to reduce its overhead and administrative costs 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in  reflecting the corporation s higher average debt balance during the year 
the increase in the average debt balance was directly related to the additional debt of mineral ridge inc in  the gain on the disposal of assets was million and primarily consisted of the sales of surplus mining equipment from the hycroft mine and the sale of the corporation s non producing tartan mine in canada 
there was no similar gain or loss from the disposal of assets in management regularly reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets and investments 
these evaluations indicated that the carrying values of certain properties and investments were overstated and  accordingly  were written down 
based upon management s evaluation  million was written down in  including bolivian mineral properties million  mineral ridge mine net assets million  and zamora accounts receivable million 
additionally  the corporation wrote off its remaining investment of million in zamora  reflecting its decreased levels of ownership and control 
there were no similar write downs in income tax expense in was nil as compared to million in the income tax expense was primarily the result of us alternative minimum taxes  which limited the corporation s ability to utilize existing loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation s consolidated cash balance at december  was million  a decrease of million from the end of the previous year 
during  operating activities consumed million  as follows 
in thousands hycroft mine bolivian properties corporate activities  net operating activities  the hycroft mine consumed million in operating activities net of million for reclamation costs 
before reclamation  the mine generated million of cash 
in december  mining activities were suspended at the hycroft mine 
gold processing and gold recovery continued in from previously mined ore 
the mine produced  ounces in  at a cash operating cost of per ounce 
bolivian and corporate activities required million and million in cash  respectively 
during  the corporation held and maintained its bolivian properties  and at the same time steps were undertaken to minimize future property holding costs 
the corporation continues to investigate alternatives to reduce its corporate overhead 
investing activities provided million in mainly from the sale of hycroft crushing and conveying equipment and spare parts 
the corporation made no material capital expenditures in in  financing activities used million to reduce the long term equipment loan from finova inc reclamation and environmental costs management estimates the current reclamation and closure costs for the corporation s hycroft mine to be million 
these costs have been charged to earnings over the life of the mine and the provision for reclamation as of december  is million 
in april  the nevada bureau of land management blm approved an amended hycroft mine reclamation plan that included the brimstone deposit  and an uncollateralized surety bond in the amount of million was posted to secure reclamation obligations under the plan 
regulatory compliance and other matters during  there were no material environmental incidents or non compliance with any applicable environmental regulations 
going concern the corporation s consolidated cash balance and working capital balance were both million as of december  million has been realized from the sale of mining equipment in the first quarter of management estimates consolidated total cash expenditures of million for  including debt repayments of million with an estimated december  cash balance of million 
management continues to pursue cost cutting measures and is actively pursuing additional sources of capital  including debt financing  the issuance of equity  mergers with other companies  and the sale of property interests and other assets 
management estimates that the corporation will have sufficient cash resources to continue its current level of activity through to the end of march the corporation relies on the hycroft mine as its only current source of operating cash flows 
mining activities at hycroft were suspended in during  hycroft produced gold from previously mined ore on the leach pads  a process that will continue through however  hycroft s remaining gold inventory is decreasing and  therefore  gold production will continue to decrease throughout the year the corporation is investigating the economic feasibility of restarting the hycroft mine and developing the amayapampa project in bolivia 
the corporation s ability to restart the hycroft mine and develop the amayapampa project is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital 
outlook following a brief rally in february and a minor readjustment in june  the price of gold has continued to remain low  finishing the year at approximately per ounce 
amayapampa cannot be developed economically at current gold prices 
the resumption of mining at hycroft  although economic at current gold prices  would attract more favorable financing terms and yield a greatly improved return for shareholders at a gold price over the corporation is reluctant to deplete its valuable gold resources before ensuring a higher return on the necessary investment 
hycroft continues to produce gold at higher than anticipated rates and will continue to produce gold into gold production  however  is dropping and management expects to produce about  ounces in to enhance the corporation s gold resource position  management has rigorously re evaluated the brimstone reserve at the hycroft mine under the scrutiny of an independent consulting firm and continues to systematically re log drill hole data and compile all existing exploration data for the hycroft property 
this exercise together with some additional field work  by the corporation s in house geologist  has identified several areas on the property for additional exploration as well as firming up drill targets to add additional oxide reserves and explore for high grade feeder zones 
the corporation will be in a position  if funding is available  to restart operations immediately if the price of gold recovers above per ounce or to start a comprehensive drilling program to expand the reserve 
in bolivia  holding costs have been reduced by the sale of yamin and capa circa to a worker s co operative and by the elimination of the stand by work force at amayapampa 
development of amayapampa will require initial capital of million and a gold price of around per ounce 
again  this project is dependent on a higher gold price and in the meantime the corporation continues to explore every avenue to maintain the asset at minimum cost until the gold price improves 
at the corporate level  management has reduced staff  moved into more economic office space and continues to explore all avenues to ensure the future of vista gold and to protect and enhance shareholder value 
in the first quarter of  four haul trucks and a shovel from the hycroft mine were sold to provide an additional million in operating capital  without shareholder dilution 
this will allow the corporation to continue on the present course into  and continue to pursue merger or acquisition opportunities and promote company growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the corporation is engaged in gold mining and related activities  including exploration  extraction  processing  and refining and reclamation 
gold bullion is the corporation s principal product 
changes in the price of gold could affect the corporation s profitability and cash flows 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time 
for a description of factors that affect gold prices  see note a to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  under item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements 
using current estimates of production  a change in the gold price would result in a corresponding change in net income and cash flows of approximately the corporation occasionally utilizes derivative commodity instruments for purposes other than trading purposes to manage the corporation s exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of gold by protecting the selling price of a portion of its production 
the market risk of these commodity instruments to the corporation s cash flow is related to the possible failure of all counterparties to honor their contractual obligations 
also  precious metals contracts between the corporation and various counterparties involve the requirement that the corporation deliver gold to the counterparty at agreed upon prices 
if the counterparty is unable to fulfill its purchase obligations  there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to receive the agreed upon sales price in the open market 
if the corporation is unable to produce sufficient gold to meet its hedging contract obligations  it may be obligated to purchase such gold at the then market price 
at december   the corporation s had no outstanding forward sales contracts 
interest rate risk at december   the corporation had a  term note bearing a fixed rate of interest at 
management does not believe that the corporation is exposed to major interest rate risk and the corporation does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the price of gold is denominated in us dollars  and all of the corporation s revenues and a majority of its expenses are incurred in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the corporation is exposed to any noteworthy foreign currency exchange rate risk and the corporation does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
