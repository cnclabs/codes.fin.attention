cpi anticipates the annual expenditures for preclinical studies  clinical trials  product development  research  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in future years 
cpi anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital 
there can be no assurance that cpi will be able to successfully complete the clinical development of aptosyn tm for any indication  that the fda will grant approval with respect to any indication within the time frame expected  if at all  that the other developments or expansions in cpi s research  development and commercialization programs will ultimately lead to revenues for the company 
cpi cannot predict the date of its first product approval  if any  the rate of revenue generated from initial product sales  if achieved  or the level of expense which may be associated with such initial product sales 
the company anticipates that it will require additional financing in the future to continue its research and development programs 
until such time as cpi is able to generate sufficient revenue from product sales  if ever  cpi plans to finance its anticipated growth and development largely through equity or debt financing and or strategic or corporate alliances 
cpi believes  based on its current operating plans  that its existing cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately million as of december   together with interest earned on this balance  will provide sufficient working capital to sustain operations into the second half of however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding prior to that time  as the company must adapt to changing circumstances arising from within the company s programs as well as from outside the company 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaborations will be available on terms acceptable to cpi  if at all 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
corporate alliances would generally require the company to give up certain marketing rights or other rights to its potential products and technology 
if additional funds should be needed but are not available  cpi may be required to modify its operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaborative arrangements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
the failure by cpi to raise capital on acceptable terms if and when needed would have a material adverse effect on cpi s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation cpi does not believe that inflation has had any significant impact on cpi s business to date 
income taxes as of december   cpi has net operating loss carryforwards nols for income tax purposes available to offset future federal income tax  subject to limitations for alternative minimum tax 
in addition  the company has other significant deferred tax assets which will also offset future income tax 
as the company has not yet achieved profitable operations  management believes the tax assets do not satisfy the realization criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes and therefore the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the entire amount of its net tax asset as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the nols available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
a change in ownership of a company of greater than within a three year period results in an annual limitation on cpi s ability to utilize its nols from tax periods prior to the ownership change 
cpi believes that the transaction with tseng triggered such limitation 
however  cpi does not expect such limitation to have a significant impact on its operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which must be adopted by the company in the year ending december   provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
as the company does not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities  the adoption of this pronouncement will have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on revenue recognition of up front non refundable license fees 
as the company has not had any license fee revenue  the adoption of sab did not have any impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the company s investment portfolio 
the company is averse to principal loss and seeks to limit default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
in particular  the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio  places its investments with high quality issuers and  except for investments with the us government  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities  predominantly those of the us government  and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and has historically been invested in securities which have original maturities of less than three months to ensure principal preservation
