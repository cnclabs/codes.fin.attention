item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in important factors regarding forward looking statements attached hereto as exhibit overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states  including cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders  inflammation and cancer 
since our inception in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  product and clinical development 
additionally  through our wholly owned subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc or aat  we are engaged in discovering and developing a portfolio of additional antibody therapeutics targeting severe unmet medical needs 
we are currently examining our two lead antibody product candidates in eight clinical development programs 
one of our antibody product candidates  pexelizumab  is an antibody fragment being developed in collaboration with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  and has completed a phase iib study in cpb or cardiopulmonary bypass surgery patients undergoing cabg or coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
pending fda or food and drug administration discussions  we expect to initiate a phase iii efficacy trial with pexelizumab in cpb patients at the earliest possible opportunity 
also in collaboration with procter gamble  we are currently conducting two additional large phase ii studies with pexelizumab in acute myocardial infarction or heart attack patients one study in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy  a procedure for dissolving clots that block heart vessels  and the other in patients receiving angioplasty  a procedure for opening up narrowed or blocked arteries that supply blood to the heart 
in september  the fda granted fast track status for the development of pexelizumab in cpb 
our other lead antibody product candidate  g  is in clinical development for the treatment of a variety of chronic autoimmune diseases 
we initiated a phase ii study in lupus nephritis  a kidney disease  and a separate phase ii study in membranous nephritis  a kidney disease  is ongoing 
we completed a phase ii clinical study in rheumatoid arthritis or ra patients and we are planning to initiate two phase iib ra studies  one of which we expect may serve as a pivotal study if we obtain strong efficacy and safety results 
in both rheumatoid arthritis and membranous nephritis  enrollment has commenced in additional month open label extension studies to test long term safety 
in addition  we have two separate on going early stage clinical programs to study g in patients with dermatomyositis  a muscle disorder  and bullous pemphigoid  a severe inflammatory skin disorder 
in october  the fda granted us orphan drug status for the development of g for the treatment of dermatomyositis 
we recently completed a phase i pilot safety trial of g in psoriasis patients 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of july  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating loses for the next several years due to expenses associated with 
product research and development  
pre clinical studies and clinical testing  
regulatory activities  
manufacturing development  scale up and commercial manufacturing  and 
developing a sales and marketing force 
in september  we acquired prolifaron  inc a privately held biopharmaceutical company located in san diego  california  through the issuance of common stock and fully vested options having an aggregate fair value of approximately million at the date of acquisition 
prolifaron was developing therapeutic antibodies addressing multiple diseases  including cancer 
the acquisition was in the form of a merger between our new wholly owned subsidiary of alexion to form alexion antibody technologies  inc  and prolifaron 
we accounted for the acquisition of prolifaron using the purchase method of accounting 
through aat  we have developed important additional capabilities to discover and develop additional antibody product candidates for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer 
in october  we contributed technology to help form a new company  arradial inc  which is aimed at commercializing our novel  desktop silicon based microarray assay technology 
the technology is expected to have applications in genomics and drug discovery 
we are a minority shareholder of arradial  inc we plan to develop and commercialize on our own those product candidates for which the clinical trials and marketing requirements can be funded by our own resources 
for those products which require greater resources  our strategy is to form corporate partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies for product development and commercialization 
results of operations fiscal years ended july    and we earned contract research revenues of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to lower contract research revenues resulting from the completion of the phase ii pexelizumab cpb study related to our collaborative research and development agreement with procter gamble 
the increase in revenues in fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to the increased contract revenues from our collaborative research and development agreement with procter gamble 
during fiscal year  we incurred research and development expenses of million  excluding non cash charges related to our acquisition of prolifaron 
these non cash charges included the in process research and development charge of million and the amortization of goodwill or purchased intangibles of million 
for fiscal years and  we incurred research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal as compared to was primarily attributable to lower clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs associated with the completion of the phase ii pexelizumab cpb study 
these lower costs were offset by increased costs from clinical trials  manufacturing development  and manufacturing of our other lead c inhibitor product candidate  g  and the consolidated on going research and development costs of aat which was formed through the september acquisition of prolifaron 
the increase in research and development costs for fiscal as compared to was primarily attributable to the on going clinical trials of our lead c inhibitor product candidates and the cost of manufacturing development and manufacturing of our c inhibitors for our clinical trials 
our general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to was principally due to increased personnel and professional fees as well as higher facilities expenses resulting from our relocation and expansion of our operations to support its growth  including our acquisition of prolifaron 
the increase in fiscal as compared to was principally due to higher payroll related costs  as well as higher facilities expenses related to increased rent expense and professional fees related to public relations and patent legal costs 
total operating expenses were substantially higher in the twelve months ended july  due principally to the one time non cash in process research and development charge of million and the non cash amortization of goodwill of million resulting from the september acquisition of prolifaron 
other income  net  was million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year as compared to was due to increased interest income from higher cash balances resulting from the million of net proceeds received from the sale of common stock in november the increase in other income  net  for fiscal as compare to was due to increased interest income from higher cash balances resulting from the net proceeds obtained from the issuance of million of subordinated convertible notes in march during fiscal year  we recorded a million non cash charge that is related to the cumulative change in accounting principle per the adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 
or sab we were required to adopt sab no later than july  we elected to adopt sab in the quarter ended april  and recognized the non cash cumulative effect adjustment of million as of august  as a result of the above factors  we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
shown below are our statements of operations for fiscal years ended   and excluding the impact of the non cash charges resulting from our acquisition of prolifaron  we incurred a pro forma net loss of million for the fiscal year ended july  twelve months ended july  amounts in s  except per share data pro forma a contract research revenues     operating expenses research and development     general and administrative     in process research development iprd  amortization of goodwill gw  total operating expenses     operating loss     other income  net     loss before cumulative effect of sab     cumulative effect of adoption of sab  net loss     net loss per share a excludes non cash iprd  amortization of gw  and cumulative effect of adoption of sab liquidity and capital resources since our inception in january  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures principally through private placements of our common and preferred stock  an initial public offering of our common stock and subsequent follow on offerings  convertible subordinated notes  other debt financing  payments under corporate collaborations and grants  and equipment and leasehold improvements financing 
in october  we filed a shelf registration statement to offer up to million of equity securities 
on november   we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million  net of fees and other expenses of approximately  related to the transaction 
in march  we completed a million private placement of our convertible subordinated notes due march  the notes bear interest semi annually on september and march of each year  beginning september  the holders may convert all or a portion of the notes into common stock at any time on or before march  at a conversion price of per share 
we incurred issuance costs related to this offering of approximately million  which are being amortized into interest expense over the seven year term of the notes 
in may  pursuant to a registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement under the securities act of with the sec to register resales of the notes and the shares of common stock into which the notes are convertible 
in november  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a follow on public offering  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in february  we acquired the manufacturing assets  principally land  buildings and laboratory equipment  for the xenotransplantation program developed by us surgical 
we financed the purchase of the manufacturing assets through a million term note payable to us surgical 
interest is per annum and is payable quarterly 
the principal balance under the note is due in may security for this term note is the manufacturing assets that we purchased 
as of july   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million 
at july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted of million that we hold in short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared to july  was due to the increase in available cash resulting from our follow on public offering of our common stock in november as of july   we have invested million in property and equipment to support our research and development efforts 
we anticipate our research and development expense will increase significantly for the foreseeable future to support our clinical and manufacturing development of our product candidates 
we lease our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut that we relocated to in november the lease has a term of ten years and six months 
at this site  we lease a total of  square feet of space  which includes approximately  square feet related to research and laboratories 
we have incurred initial leasehold improvements aggregating approximately million 
in addition  we are paying a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses 
our pilot manufacturing plant  which may be used for producing compounds for some of our current and anticipated clinical trials  is expected to remain in new haven  connecticut and encompasses approximately  square feet of labs and offices 
we are currently negotiating a longer term arrangement for the facilities in new haven  connecticut 
we believe our new space and our pilot manufacturing facility will be adequate for our current ongoing activities 
alexion antibody technologies  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  leases approximately  square feet of labs and office space in san diego  california 
procter gamble has agreed to fund clinical development and manufacturing of pexelizumab  initially for use in cardiopulmonary bypass surgery  myocardial infarction and angioplasty 
the procter gamble collaboration does not involve any of our other product candidates 
we anticipate that our existing available capital resources together with the anticipated funding from our collaboration agreement with procter and gamble  as well as the addition of our interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next thirty six months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including 
progress of our research and development programs  
progress and results of clinical trials  
time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  
costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents and any necessary licenses  
dependence on procter gamble for performance of development and commercial matters related to pexelizumab  
delays in development of or changes in status of commercial relationships  
delays in developing or arranging satisfactory manufacturing capability  
costs of manufacturing scale up and commercial manufacturing  
our ability to establish marketing and sales capabilities  and 
our ability to establish development and commercialization relationships 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  for 
research  
pre clinical studies and clinical testing  
manufacturing process development  
additional capital expenditures related to personnel  and facilities expansion  
clinical and commercial manufacturing requirements  and  
marketing and sales 
if and when we achieve contractual milestones related to product development and product license applications and approvals  additional payments would be required if we elect to continue and maintain our licenses with our licensors  aggregating up to million 
furthermore  we will owe royalties to parties we have licensed intellectual property from in connection with the sale of our products 
in addition to funds we may receive from our collaboration with procter gamble  we will need to raise or generate substantial additional funding in order to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
our additional financing may include public or private debt or equity offerings  equity line facilities  bank loans and or collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available on terms acceptable by us  if at all  or that discussions with potential strategic or collaborative partners will results in any agreements on a timely basis  if at all 
the unavailability of additional financing could require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain research and product development programs or to license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise undertake ourselves  any of which could have a material adverse effect 
for tax reporting purposes  as of july   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards  which expire through and million of tax credit carryforwards  which expire commencing in fiscal provisions of the tax reform act of may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year if certain events occur  including a provision relating to cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we believe that we have triggered these limitation provisions 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which together significantly change the accounting and disclosures required for these activities and related assets 
the primary changes resulting from these standards consist of the cessation of the pooling of interests method of accounting and how goodwill and intangible assets will be segregated  amortized or not amortized  reviewed for impairment if any  and disclosed within the footnotes to financial statements 
our adoption of sfas no 
will have no impact on the historical financial statements 
we elected to adopt sfas no 
effective august  the adoption of sfas no 
will cause the amortization as it relates to the million of goodwill acquired in connection with acquisition of prolifaron to cease at this date 
prior to the adoption of this standard  this annual amortization was expected to be approximately million annually over a seven year period 
on a prospective basis  this goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews  and  if conditions warrant  interim reviews based upon its estimated fair value 
impairment charges  if any  will be recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period in which the impairment is determined 
we have not yet determined whether an impairment charge  if any  would need to be recorded as a result of the adoption of this standard 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
an amendment of sfas no 
for the sole purpose of updating the effective date of adoption of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition as we do not currently hold derivative financial instruments and do not engage in hedging activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we account for our marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our marketable securities are held for purposes other than trading and we believe that we currently have no material adverse market risk exposure 
the marketable securities as of july   had maturities of less than two years 
the weighted average interest rate on marketable securities at july  and was and  respectively 
the fair value of marketable securities held at july  was million 
at july   we had aggregate fixed rate debt of approximately million 
if interest rates associated with this debt were increased  a corresponding increase in our annual interest expense of approximately  would occur
