item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in general proxymed is an electronic healthcare transaction processing services company providing connectivity services and related value add products to physicians  payers  medical laboratories  pharmacies and other healthcare providers 
our electronic transaction processing services support a broad range of both financial and clinical transactions 
to facilitate these services  we operate proxynet  our secure  proprietary national electronic information network  which provides physicians and other primary care providers with direct connectivity to one of the industry s largest group of payers  the largest group of clinical laboratories and the largest group of chain and independent pharmacies 
our products and services are provided from our three operating facilities located in fort lauderdale  florida  new albany  indiana  and santa ana  california 
in march  we sold our non core network integration and prescription drug dispensing segments 
these two segments are shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
in may  a number of factors  including a weak nasdaq stock market  particularly in the ehealth segment  and sales into the market of a significant number of shares of our common stock resulting from margin calls against our then largest shareholder  contributed to the decline in the price of our common stock below for a period of ten consecutive trading days in april and may certain contractual provisions were triggered which would have permitted our series b preferred shareholders to convert their preferred shares and exercise their warrants into a significant number of shares of common stock 
as a result  we entered into a redemption and exchange agreement with holders of  of the  shares of the series b preferred stock 
in order for us to comply with the terms of the redemption and exchange agreement and continue to fund our operating requirements  we were required to raise additional capital  and in june  we sold  in a private placement to institutional and individual investors  a total of  of convertible debt securities and issued five year warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share to the investors and the placement agent  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately  on june   upon the completion of the redemption of the  series b preferred  the convertible debt automatically converted into series c preferred shares

as a result of our reassessment of our business plan under our new management team  our new strategy is now more tightly focused on leveraging our leading position as a neutral  independent back end connectivity provider rather than developing software products and applications for the physician s desktop

after these proceeds and expenditures  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  as of december  these available funds continue to be used for operations  the further development of our products and services  and other general corporate purposes 
as a result of the completed sales of our network integration and prescription drug dispensing segments in march  we received payments of approximately  through december  under the notes issued to us by the purchasers of these businesses 
additionally  as a result of acquisitions made in and  we paid i approximately  in april for the final assessment of a tax audit at key communications services  inc  ii  in april to the former owner of clinical microsystems with  in cash and  shares of common stock  and iii  in june to the former owner of our prescribe software system 
we are continuously evaluating acquisition opportunities and other strategic alternatives that may add synergies to our product offerings and business strategy 
in may  we announced a reorganization plan aimed at reducing costs and reallocating resources 
as a result  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  including the resignation of our chief executive officer  president chief operating officer  chief financial officer  chief marketing officer  and other management positions  and our former chief executive officer was appointed interim chief executive officer 
we estimated that our annual expenses would be reduced by approximately million under this plan  and with additional personnel and other expense reductions in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we have exceeded the expense reduction goal 
our previous chairman interim chief executive officer has become our vice chairman 
we have since appointed a new chairman chief executive officer and a new chief operating officer 
through the second quarter of  we had been aggressively implementing our strategic plan which concentrated on providing a one stop solution for physicians and empowering them with internet enabled tools as desktop solutions 
as a result of our reassessment of our business plan  our new strategy is now more tightly focused on leveraging our leading position as an independent back end connectivity provider rather than developing products and services for the physician s desktop 
through strategic relationships and partnerships with front end solutions providers  our goal is to drive more healthcare transactions through proxynet while remaining neutral in the battle for the physician s desktop 
additionally  since we do have an existing customer base of physicians and other healthcare providers  we expect that there will be opportunities to increase revenues by cross selling our existing products and services to these current customers  as well as revenue opportunities from the development of new services from our development efforts  including proxymed 
com  our healthcare internet portal 
while we have reduced the specific groups within our development workforce in an effort to control expenses  nevertheless  we remain committed to developing additional capabilities and value added products and services to our back end connectivity network and to proxymed 
com 
in june  we paid in full and terminated our accounts receivable based revolving line of credit that had an outstanding balance of  we have not entered into any other line of credit arrangement at this time 
at the current time  we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  we have identified approximately  in capital expenditure purchases to be made in relating to hipaa compliance for our computer networks and facilities 
as we have continued to reduce our expenses subsequent to december in order to achieve our goal of operational cash flow break even  we must be able to maintain and increase our revenues 
we believe that we can continue to make progress in our business strategy and achieve bottom line profitability by the beginning of the third quarter of while our payer services and laboratory services business units continue to generate positive cash flows  our prescription services business unit has not generated positive cash flow to date 
in addition  we were incurring significant expense to expand our proxymed 
com portal and to support our corporate staff 
as a result  we reduced expenditures  including the layoff of operations and corporate employees between the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  in order to achieve overall profitability 
we continue to believe that there will ultimately be significant opportunities in the electronic prescription transaction space 
today  we continue to support our existing prescription services customers with appropriate levels of service 
going forward  as the market grows transaction volume through increased physician adoption and utilization  we intend to be ready to take advantage of such opportunities 
while we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to fund our future operational capital requirements based on our current level of revenues and expenditures  we may need to raise funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt in the public or private capital markets in order to fund specific research and development projects or pursue additional strategic acquisitions 
our ability to raise any additional funds may be adversely affected if  among other things  we do not continue to improve our operating performance or achieve increased market acceptance of our products and services 
there can be no assurance that any additional funding will be available to us  or if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of significantly diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we believe that if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing for further product development or strategic acquisitions  such inability may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our business plan and may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles for recognizing revenue 
sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this document contains forward looking statements that reflect our current assumptions and expectations regarding future events 
while these statements reflect our current judgment  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from projected results due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the soundness of our business strategies relative to the perceived market opportunities  our ability to successfully develop  market  sell  install and upgrade our clinical and financial transaction services and applications to physicians  payers  medical laboratories and pharmacies  our ability to compete effectively on price and support services  our assessment of the healthcare industry s need  desire and ability to become technology efficient  and our ability and that of our business associates to comply with various government rules regarding healthcare information and patient privacy 
these and other risk factors are more fully discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  which we strongly urged you to read 
we expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements 
when used in this document  the words believes  estimated  expects  anticipates  may and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the following are additional factors to those appearing in this document affecting our business and operations 
you should carefully read these together with this document and our other sec filings before considering investing in our company we have important business relationships with other companies to market and sell some of our clinical products and services which have not resulted in significant sales yet and if these companies are unsuccessful  we will need to add this emphasis internally  which may divert our efforts and resources from others projects 
for the marketing and sale of some of our clinical products and services  we entered into important business relationships with physician office management information system vendors and electronic medical record vendors and through other agreements 
these important business relationships  which have required and may continue to require significant commitments of effort and resources  have yet to generate substantial recurring revenue  and we cannot assure that they will ever generate substantial recurring revenue 
most of these relationships are on a non exclusive basis  and we cannot assure that our electronic commerce partners and other strategic partners  most of whom have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do  will not develop and market products and services in competition with us in the future or will not otherwise discontinue their relationship with us 
also  our arrangements with some of our partners involve negotiated payments to the partners based on percentages of revenues generated by the partners 
if the payments prove to be too high  we may be unable to realize acceptable margins  but if the payments prove to be too low  the partners may not be motivated to produce a sufficient volume of revenues 
the success of our important business relationships will depend in part upon our partners own competitive  marketing and strategic considerations  including the relative advantages of alternative products being developed and marketed by such partners 
if any such partners are unsuccessful in marketing our products  we will need to place added emphasis on these aspects of our business internally  which may divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects 
our laboratory communication devices may be replaced with web based technology for lab results delivery  and we may not be successful in converting our customers to our own internet portal  proxymed 
com  which would adversely impact our revenues 
a key element of our laboratory services business strategy is to market our laboratory results reporting devices and related services  and our web based solutions  directly to independent and hospital based medical laboratories 
as the internet becomes a more acceptable method of transmitting laboratory orders and reporting results because of the efficiencies and savings believed to be available  we are leveraging our plus years of goodwill and reputation for quality of products and superior service to migrate our customers over to our own internet portal  proxymed 
com 
we expect others to develop similar web based solutions and compete aggressively in an attempt to capture our large customer base 
we have no assurances that we will be able to retain or continue to grow our customer base 
further  even as to the continuing sales of our laboratory communication devices  we are unable to control many of the factors that influence our customers buying decisions  including our customers budgets and procedures for approving expenditures  and the changing political  economic and regulatory influences which affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
the acceptance of electronic transaction processing in the healthcare industry is still in its early stages  thus  the future of our business is uncertain 
our strategy anticipates that electronic processing of healthcare transactions  including transactions involving clinical as well as financial information  will become more widespread and that providers and third party payers increasingly will use electronic transaction processing networks for the processing and transmission of data 
electronic transmission of healthcare transactions and  in particular  the use of the internet to transmit them is still developing  and complexities in the nature and types of transactions which must be processed have hindered  to some degree  the development and acceptance of electronic transaction processing in this industry 
we cannot assure that continued conversion from paper based transaction processing to electronic transaction processing in the healthcare industry  using proprietary physician management systems or the internet  will occur 
our clinical transaction products and services have yet to be tested on a large scale and could fail under a heavy customer load 
the quality of our clinical transaction products and services is important to our business 
although we have completed the development of most of our electronic transaction processing network  which we believe efficiently performs the principal functions for which it has been designed  our clinical transaction products and services and the network are currently being utilized only by a limited number of customers for these transactions 
we cannot assure that  upon widespread commercial use of our clinical transaction products and services  they will satisfactorily perform all of the functions for which we have designed them or that unanticipated technical or other errors will not occur which would result in increased costs or material delays 
any of these errors could delay our plans  result in harmful publicity or cause us to incur substantial remedial costs 
since an error by any party in the process of prescribing drugs and filling prescriptions could result in substantial injury to a patient  our liability insurance may not be adequate in a catastrophic situation 
our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are unavoidably part of being in the healthcare electronic transaction processing industry 
many of our products and services relate to prescribing and refilling of drugs and the transmission of medical laboratory results  an error by any party in the process could result in substantial injury to a patient 
as a result  our liability risks are significant 
we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims arising out of our current or proposed operations  or that our present level of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable cost 
a partially or completely uninsured claim against us  if successful and of sufficient magnitude  would have significant adverse financial consequences 
our inability to obtain insurance of the type and in the amounts we require could generally impair our ability to market our products and services 
we depend on connections to insurance companies and other payers  and if we lose these connections  our service offerings would be limited and less desirable to healthcare participants 
our business is enhanced by the substantial number of payers  such as insurance companies  medicare and medicaid agencies to which we have electronic connections 
these connections may either be made directly or through a clearinghouse 
we have attempted to enter into suitable contractual relationships to ensure long term payer connectivity  however  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our links with all these payers 
in addition  we cannot assure that we will be able to develop new connections  either directly or through clearinghouses  on satisfactory terms 
lastly  some third party payers provide systems directly to healthcare providers  bypassing us and other third party processors 
our failure to maintain existing connections with payers and clearinghouses or to develop new connections as circumstances warrant  or to increase the utilization of direct links between providers and payers  could cause our electronic transaction processing system to be less desirable to healthcare participants  which would slow down or reduce the number of transactions that we process and for which we are paid 
if electronic transaction processing penetrates the healthcare industry  we may face pressure to reduce our prices which potentially may cause us to no longer be competitive 
if electronic transaction processing extensively penetrates the healthcare market or becomes highly standardized  it is possible that competition among electronic transaction processors will focus increasingly on pricing 
this competition may put intense pressure on us to reduce our pricing in order to retain market share 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in our prices  or if we are unable to introduce new  innovative service offerings with higher prices  we may not be competitive 
computer network systems like ours could suffer security and privacy breaches that could harm our customers and us 
we currently operate servers and maintain connectivity from multiple facilities 
despite our implementation of network security measures  such as limiting physical and network access to routers  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems caused by customers or other users 
computer viruses  break ins or other security problems could lead to interruption  delays or cessation in service to our customers 
these problems could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in the computer systems of our customers  which may deter potential customers from doing business with us and give rise to possible liability to users whose security or privacy has been infringed 
the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential customers may inhibit the growth of the healthcare information services industry in general  and our customer base and business in particular 
a significant security breach could result in loss of customers  damage to our reputation  direct damages  costs of repair and detection and other unplanned expenses 
we depend on uninterrupted computer access for our customers  any prolonged interruptions in our operations could cause our customers to seek alternative providers of our services 
our success is dependent on our ability to deliver high quality  uninterrupted computer networking and hosting  requiring us to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in servers against damage by fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events 
we plan to develop additional back up site capability and a program to manage technology to reduce risks in the event of a disaster  including periodic back ups of our computer programs and data 
any damage or failure resulting in prolonged interruptions in our operations  such as the current california rolling blackouts  could cause our customers to seek alternative providers of our services 
in particular  a system failure  if prolonged  could result in reduced revenues  loss of customers and damage to our reputation  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
while we carry property and business interruption insurance to cover operations  the coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that may occur 
we may not be able to retain key personnel or replace them if they leave 
our success is largely dependent on the personal efforts of michael k 
hoover  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
although we have entered into employment agreements with mr 
hoover and other senior executives  the loss of any of their services could cause our business to suffer 
our success is also dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified operations  development and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the healthcare information services industry is intense  and we cannot assure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our planned operations 
we may issue additional shares which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain events over which you have no control could result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock  which would dilute your ownership percentage in proxymed and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock for many reasons including o to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions  o upon the exercise or conversion or an exchange of outstanding options  warrants and shares of convertible preferred stock  or o in lieu of cash payment of dividends 
in addition  the number of shares of common stock that we are required to issue upon conversion or exercise  as the case may be  of series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock and many of our outstanding options and warrants may increase if certain anti dilution events occur such as  certain issuances of common stock  options and convertible securities
