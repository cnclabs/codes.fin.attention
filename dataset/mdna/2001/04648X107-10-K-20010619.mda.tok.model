item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements which involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading provider of integrated automation systems for the semiconductor and related electronics manufacturing industries 
we design systems that enable semiconductor manufacturers to increase their manufacturing productivity and protect their investment in silicon wafers during the manufacture of ics 
we sell our systems directly to semiconductor manufacturers  as well as to oems that integrate our systems with their equipment for sale to semiconductor manufacturers 
our sales are tied to capital expenditures at fabs and as such are cyclical in nature 
fiscal years  and have demonstrated the cyclical nature of our business  as discussed below 
we use a dedicated direct sales force worldwide  which is supported by distributors in europe 
our functional currency is the us dollar  except in japan where our functional currency is the japanese yen 
to date  the impact of currency translation gains or losses has not been material to our sales or results of operations 
during fiscal year  we experienced a sharp downturn in our business in response to a dramatic slowdown in the asian economies and an over capacity of memory chip manufacturing 
in fiscal year  we experienced significant growth due to the dramatic growth in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
the increase in capital spending was driven by the growth in demand for both memory and logic chips in a broad variety of products  particularly those of internet and telecommunications equipment manufacturers 
in the first half of fiscal year  the demand for our products remained strong  but in the second half of fiscal year  the demand for our products decreased significantly as semiconductor manufacturers sharply reduced capital expenditures 
this decrease in capital expenditures resulted in slower bookings and significant order push outs and cancellations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition to the changes in the business cycle impacting demand for our products  we are beginning to see a shift from mm and mm to mm products 
in fiscal year  mm and mm products comprised virtually all of our net sales 
these products generate higher gross profit than our new mm products 
while mm products remain dominant in our product mix  the contribution of mm products has increased from percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year to percent of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year this shift negatively impacted our gross profit  particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during fiscal years and  our customers added significant capacity in mm and mm and in response we increased production of our related products 
meanwhile  we continued to develop updated versions of these products 
as a result  the severity and quickness of the recent downturn in the semiconductor business cycle left us with substantial raw material and purchase commitments for our older mm and mm products 
we do not believe that our customers will continue to purchase older versions of our mm and mm products when capital spending resumes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded million of inventory reserves and took an additional million charge for purchase commitments related to mm and mm products that we do not believe are going to be consumed in the next upturn 
in may  we announced our intention to discontinue production of our mm products due to our belief that there will be limited future spending on mm fabs 
prior to fiscal year  our revenue policy was to recognize revenue at the time the customer took title to the product  generally at the time of shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts was recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
we changed our revenue recognition policy during fiscal year  based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we now recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
some of our products are large volume consumables that are tested to industry and or customer acceptance criteria prior to shipment 
revenue for these types of products is recognized at shipment 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize the product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder recognized when the other elements  primarily installation  have been completed 
certain other products are highly customized systems that cannot be completed or adequately tested to customer specifications prior to shipment from the factory and we do not recognize revenue until these products are formally accepted by the customer 
revenue for spare parts sales is recognized on shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in accrued liabilities and other 
we account for software revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenues for integration software work are recognized on a percentage of completion 
software license revenue  which is not material to the consolidated financial statements  is recognized when we ship the software  payment is due within one year  collectability is probable and there are no significant obligations remaining 
the majority of our revenues in any single quarter are typically derived from a few large customers  and our revenues will therefore fluctuate based on a number of factors  including 
the timing of significant customer orders  
the timing of product shipment and acceptance  
variations in the mix of products sold  
the introduction of new products  
changes in customer buying patterns  
fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  
the availability of key components  
pressure from competitors  and 
general trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry  electronics industry and overall economy 
acquisitions during the three fiscal years ended march   we acquired the following companies in june  we acquired all of the shares of pst  which manufactures wafer sorting equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers 
the acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been restated to include the financial statements of pst 
in july  we acquired hdi  which develops robotics equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in august  we acquired pat  which develops continuous flow transport systems for use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in  we increased our ownership percentage of mecs  a japanese engineering and robotics manufacturing company  to percent 
we subsequently merged mecs into aji 
the transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in february  we acquired amp  a manufacturer of precision parts 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in february  we acquired semifab  a manufacturer of environmental control equipment and a contract manufacturer 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
fiscal years ended march   and the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development of acquired business and product line amortization of acquired intangible assets non recurring charges total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes income loss before effect of change in accounting policy cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax benefit net income loss net sales 
our net sales in the fiscal year ended march  increased by percent to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  net sales in the fiscal year ended march  increased percent to million 
our fiscal year net sales were negatively impacted by reduced capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers because of a slowdown in asian economies and demand for semiconductor devices 
fiscal year  on the other hand  benefited from a sharp upturn in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers and our mm product market leadership and positioning 
our increase in net sales in fiscal year over fiscal year resulted from approximately million of net sales contributed by mecs  amp and semifab  which were not part of our consolidated results for fiscal year  and continued growth in demand for our other products 
while we had sequential growth in net sales for the first three quarters of fiscal year  fourth quarter net sales declined by percent from the third quarter 
this decline resulted from a substantial reduction in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers worldwide 
we experienced a material decline in net sales of our mm products  which was partially offset by increased sales of our mm products 
for the first quarter of fiscal year  we currently expect that net sales will be to million 
our international sales  including the local revenues recorded at our foreign locations  were as follows dollars in millions fiscal year ended march  of of of sales sales sales taiwan japan other total asia europe total international direct sales to international customers remain a substantial portion of our net sales 
the increase in japan s share of our international net sales in fiscal year is due to the million contribution to net sales from mecs products 
during fiscal year  we achieved our first sales in malaysia to two new semiconductor manufacturers  and our systems were shipped to the people s republic of china for a new semiconductor manufacturing facility of a major us electronics company 
net sales to our european customers in fiscal year grew by approximately percent compared to fiscal year net sales 
this increase was primarily the result of our ability to leverage a successful retrofit of a texas instruments us semiconductor facility using smif technology to win a subsequent texas instruments mm project in germany 
as mm products comprise a higher percent of our net sales  over time we expect that us sales will continue to grow as a percent of total net sales 
this is because most of our mm products will be sold to oems  most of which are located in the united states and japan and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
during fiscal year  we had one reportable segment 
the net sales by product or service categories comprising our net sales for the three fiscal years ended march   and were as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year ended march  smif systems    robotics    smart traveler systems    non smif systems    services other    total    gross profit 
our gross profit was percent  percent and percent of net sales for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
gross profit in fiscal year was negatively impacted because we were unable to reduce our manufacturing overhead to compensate for the percent decrease in revenues compared to fiscal year we also increased our inventory reserves by million during fiscal year in response to a rapid decline in sales activity during that period resulting in increased excess and obsolete inventories 
in addition  significant orders were received and shipped near the end of each quarter requiring higher levels of overtime by our employees 
during fiscal year  the increase in gross profit resulted from the combined effect of materials cost reduction achieved through product re design efforts and the dramatically increased rate of absorption of fixed costs resulting from the percent increase in net sales over fiscal year the decrease in our gross profit in fiscal year to percent is primarily due to the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in mecs in late march  other changes in product mix and the need to take substantial inventory and loss reserves in the fourth quarter of fiscal year since we acquired a majority ownership interest in mecs  we have made substantial improvements in the gross profit at mecs through cost reduction engineering efforts and improved absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead through higher sales volumes 
however  the gross profit on mecs products is significantly lower than the average gross profit produced on our other products 
other changes in product mix that negatively impacted our fiscal year gross profit include the increase in the percent of net sales of mm products 
as our mm products are still very early in their product life cycle  the gross profit on these products are significantly lower than on our mm and mm products 
in march  we expensed million for excess inventories  purchase commitments and losses on system sales for which future revenue would not cover our expected costs to complete 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we currently expect that gross profit will be in the range of to percent of net sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing percent  percent and percent of net sales for the respective periods then ended 
we increased research and development spending in both fiscal years and to support ongoing product development needs of acquired companies 
this increase is also due to increased spending to support our new smif product series  plus portal  transport product technologies  robotic products and increased expenditures for the development of automated material handling technology for the mm market 
our research and development expenses as a percent of net sales can vary significantly based on the level of net sales and our need to continue investing in research and development activities to remain competitive 
we capitalize certain legal costs related to our patents 
we have not capitalized costs associated with software development because such costs incurred to date that are eligible for capitalization have not been material 
we expect our research and development activities and related expenditures to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing percent  percent and percent of net sales for the respective periods then ended 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales are subject to significant variation with changes in net sales because it consists of many activities that have costs which are either fixed or semi variable 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing percent  percent and percent of net sales for the respective periods then ended 
the increasing trend in selling and marketing expenses in the fiscal years ended march   and is the result of our expanding presence in europe  japan and asia 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing percent  percent and percent of net sales for the respective periods then ended 
general and administrative expenses have increased largely as a result of our acquisitions in fiscal years and in fiscal year  we also increased our infrastructure to support the percent increase in net sales 
as a result of our acquisitions during the last three years  we currently operate with a number of independent systems 
in order to position ourselves for future growth opportunities  we will need to increase our investment in administrative systems and processes which will increase the fixed costs associated with general and administrative functions 
while these investments should provide long term productivity improvements  our transition to new systems may result in increased expense levels before expense reductions from any productivity improvements are realized 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization expenses relating to acquired intangible assets were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing percent  percent and percent of net sales for the respective periods then ended 
we amortize the acquired intangible assets over periods ranging from four to fourteen years 
non recurring charges 
in the fiscal year ended march  we underwent significant restructuring of our operations to reduce our cost structure in response to a percent reduction in net sales 
we also restructured activities in japan and europe to reposition those activities to compete more effectively 
in addition  we repositioned or eliminated certain product offerings 
the restructuring resulted in terminating the employment of us employees and international employees 
during fiscal year  we decided to move to a purely direct sales channel in japan  replacing a distributorship arrangement 
as a result  we paid a fee of million to cancel the distribution agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in response to the drop in net sales and new orders in the fourth quarter  we reduced our workforce by approximately regular full time employees and approximately temporary employees and contractors primarily based in fremont  california  and shut down a small manufacturing facility in japan 
the charge associated with these actions was million 
in process research and development of acquired businesses and product line 
charges to in process research and development of acquired businesses and product line were million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and respectively  representing percent and percent of net sales for the respective periods then ended 
there were no charges in fiscal year during the fiscal year ended march   we completed the acquisitions of the fluorotrac product line and hdi 
we accounted for the acquisition of hdi using the purchase method of accounting during the quarter ended september  in connection with the purchase price allocation of fluorotrac  we recorded a write off of approximately million of in process research and development costs in the quarter ended june  in connection with the purchase price allocation of hdi  we recorded a write off of approximately million of in process research and development costs in the quarter ended september  during the year ended march   we completed the acquisition of pat and a majority interest in mecs 
the pat acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting during the quarter ended september  and the mecs acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting during the quarter ended march  in connection with the purchase price allocation of pat  we recorded a write off of approximately million of in process research and development costs in the quarter ended september  in connection with the purchase price allocation of mecs we recorded a write off of approximately million of in process research and development costs in the quarter ended march  the decision to write off these costs was primarily due to the fact that the acquired in process research and development related to the fluorotrac product line  hdi  pat and mecs had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no perceived alternative future uses 
actions and comments regarding other companies from the commission have indicated that they are reviewing the current valuation methodology of purchased in process research and development relating to acquisitions 
the commission is concerned that some companies are writing off more of the value of an acquisition than is appropriate 
we believe that we are in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist 
however  the commission may seek to reduce the amount of purchased in process research and development we have previously expensed 
this would result in the restatement of our previously filed financial statements and could have a material negative impact on the financial results for the period subsequent to the particular acquisition 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing percent  percent and percent of net sales for the respective periods then ended 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales during fiscal year over fiscal year was largely due to the percent increase in net sales activity during fiscal year the decrease as a percentage of net sales during fiscal year over fiscal year was largely due to the percent increase in net sales activity during fiscal year although other income expense  net  has fluctuated over the past several years  other income expense  net  has increased primarily because of the increase in interest income on our increasingly higher cash levels 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing an effective tax rate of percent  percent and percent for the respective periods then ended 
in fiscal year  we experienced a lower effective tax rate compared to the prior year s effective tax rate of percent due to the impact of prior year non deductible in process research and development write offs related to the acquisition of pat and mecs  respectively 
as of march   we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  of which million relates to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits generated by us and our domestic subsidiaries 
these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits expire at various dates through march  included in this amount are pre merger federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million generated by pat  pst and semifab  which will expire at various dates through march  the utilization of the net operating losses are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
as of march   million of the mecs deferred tax asset related to pre merger foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which expire in the deferred tax asset related to these foreign net operating loss carryforwards is included in the foreign deferred tax asset related to mecs 
the utilization of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards is subject to the ability of mecs to generate future foreign taxable income 
a valuation allowance has been recorded related to pre merger net operating losses and other deferred tax assets of pst  amp  semifab and mecs of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
although the deferred tax asset is considered realizable  actual amounts could be reduced if sufficient future taxable income is not achieved 
cumulative effect on an accounting change  net of tax 
we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  or a loss of per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change to comply with sab as of the beginning of the year 
selected quarterly financial data the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statement of operations for each of the eight quarterly periods ended march  the data for the four quarterly periods for fiscal year show the pro forma effect of applying sab throughout fiscal year  and reconciles the differences with those amounts previously reported 
the data for the four quarterly periods for fiscal year show the effect of restating the first three quarters of fiscal year as if the provisions of sab had been applied  and reconciles the differences with those amounts previously reported 
you should read this information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we have prepared this unaudited consolidated information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements  reflecting all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the operating results for any quarter

 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
 which is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not currently engage in any material hedging activities  we believe that the application of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities and public stock offerings  customer pre payments  bank borrowings and cash generated from operations 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash equivalents and short term investments  million in short term investments  million in working capital and million in long term debt and finance leases 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to our net income of million and non cash charges to net income including depreciation and amortization of million and inventory reserve adjustments of million  partially offset by an increase in inventories of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million 
we used million in connection with a synthetic lease for land and land improvements 
in addition  we used million in connection with the acquisition of additional ownership interest in mecs  million in connection with the acquisition of amp and million in connection with the acquisition of semifab 
we also used million to modify our facilities and purchase new equipment and furniture used in our operations 
the uses were partially offset by the sale of short term investments of million  net 
cash flows from financing activities 
during fiscal year  we made net principal payments on short term and long term debt and finance leases of million 
during fiscal year  we issued  shares of common stock in connection with our employee stock programs for an aggregate of million 
effective as of june   we entered into a synthetic lease transaction with abn amro bank nv  or abn  as agent for certain lenders  to acquire and finance certain unimproved real property in fremont  california 
in connection with that transaction  we leased the real property  committed to payments aggregating  plus interest over a five year lease period and agreed to construct a manufacturing and campus facility on the property thereon 
effective february   we amended the agreement with abn to obtain abn s commitment to fund an additional sum of approximately  for construction of improvements to the property  of which million was advanced by the syndicate for certain engineering costs incurred in preparation for making leasehold improvements to the land 
due to changes in our infrastructure needs  we later determined not to proceed with development of the property as required by the agreements  and effective may   amended our agreements with abn and committed to purchase the property for an aggregate purchase price of  plus interest and other charges on or before december  under these latest amendments  we are  among other things  released from our obligation to improve the property and abn is released from its commitment to fund construction costs 
we have not yet determined whether to sell the property or hold it for future development or sale 
we believe that the current fair market value of the land is substantially less than the original purchase price due to a decline in the real estate market in the freemont area 
if sold in today s market  we estimate that proceeds from the sale would be in the range of to million less than the amount due to the bank syndicate 
we also believe that we will be required to record an impairment charge or other reserve with respect to the land during the quarter ending june   the exact size of which has not yet been determined 
we anticipate that operating expenses will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
however  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements until the end of fiscal year at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
such financing may not be available to us on a timely basis if at all or  if available  on terms acceptable to us and not dilutive to our shareholders 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or forego acquisition opportunities which could reduce our revenues  increase our losses  and harm our business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risks interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of short term fixed income securities and by policy is limited by the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities have their fair market value adversely affected due to rise in interest rates 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for the investment portfolio at march  all investments mature  by policy  in twelve months or less dollars in thousands 
restricted cash equivalents and restricted short term investments represent amounts that are restricted as to their use in accordance with a lease agreement more fully described in note to our financial statements 
average carrying interest amount rate cash equivalents us corporate debt us  debt securities issued by states of the united states and political subdivisions of the states  total cash equivalents  short term investments us corporate debt us  restricted cash equivalents us corporate debt us  debt securities issued by states of the united states and political subdivisions of the states  total restricted cash equivalents  restricted short term investments us corporate debt us  debt securities issued by states of the united states and political subdivisions of the states  total restricted short term investments  foreign currency exchange risk 
we engage in international operations and transact business in various foreign countries 
the primary foreign currency cash flows are located in japan  europe  singapore and taiwan 
although we and our subsidiaries operate and sell products in various global markets  substantially all sales are denominated in the us dollar  except in japan  therefore reducing the foreign currency risk factor 
in march  we began to employ a foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts in japan 
to date  the foreign currency transactions and exposure to exchange rate volatility have not been significant 
there can be no assurance that foreign currency risk will not be a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future
