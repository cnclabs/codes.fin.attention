item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations change in accounting principle  and an exception item of  in representing the remaining book value of the vapor compression equipment previously used by our company that was written down to zero 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce and where the use of reverse osmosis technology to produce potable water is economically feasible 
we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water since there is no natural supply of fresh water on the cayman islands 
on july  we acquired seatec belize ltd  a company organized under the laws of belize 
seatec belize ltd  now renamed belize water ltd  owns and operates a reverse osmosis plant in ambergris caye  belize and provides potable water to wasa 
in december  we signed a water supply agreement with a bahamian developer  to provide potable water to bimini sands resort  a property in south bimini island  bahamas 
we are also in discussions with the government of the bahamas regarding the provision of potable water to other properties in bimini  including residential  commercial and tourist properties 
for the year ended december   our net income increased by to  when compared with net income of  in there are no income taxes in the cayman islands 
in october  we doubled our per share dividend to ordinary shareholders from to per year and in december  we increased it from to per year  payable on a quarterly basis 
as of february   our board of directors has established a policy that our company will maintain a dividend pay out ratio in the range of to of net income 
this policy is subject to modification by our board of directors 
we expect to continue increasing our dividend as our earnings grow 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to provide potable water in seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman island 
we obtain water from two reverse osmosis plants on grand cayman  which together are capable of producing million us gallons per day  or approximately million us gallons per year 
we own our reverse osmosis plants and substantially all of the miles of our underground distribution infrastructure 
for the year ended december   we supplied million us gallons of water to hotels  residential customers  condominiums  other commercial customers and government facilities 
we also have operations in ambergris caye  belize which provides water from one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant  capable of producing  us gallons per day or approximately million us gallons per year  to wasa which distributes the water to residential  commercial and tourist properties in ambergris caye  belize 
for the year ended december   we supplied approximately million us gallons to wasa 
we also entered into a water supply agreement with south bimini international ltd  a company incorporated in the commonwealth of bahamas 
under the agreement south bimini international ltd 
is committed to pay for a minimum of  us gallons of water per residential unit per month  us gallons residential per unit per year on a take or pay basis in relation to the bimini sands resort property in south bimini island  bahamas 
the price of water supplied is adjusted for inflation annually based on bahamas government indices 
the implementation of the agreement is subject to approval by certain regulatory bodies  which is expected by may no water sales resulted from this agreement for the year ended december  considerable development is taking place on grand cayman island  and particularly in our licensed areas  to accommodate both the growing local population and increased tourism 
because our license requires us to supply water to developments in our licensed area  the planning department of the cayman islands government routinely advises us of proposed developments in our licensed area 
this advance notice allows us to manage our production capacity to meet anticipated demand 
we believe that we have or have contracted for a sufficient supply of water to meet the foreseeable future demand 
we installed our first reverse osmosis plant in december at governor s harbour  located in the seven mile beach area  through a water purchase agreement with ocean conversion cayman ltd 
under the agreement  ocean conversion operates the plant  and we must purchase a minimum volume of water from ocean conversion 
in addition  ocean conversion has to provide to us additional volumes of water upon demand up to a fixed level  and any excess on a best efforts basis 
the agreement requires a plant capacity of million us gallons per day  which is the maximum capacity of the plant 
we make installment payments to ocean conversion against the cost of the plant as part of the purchase price of the water provided to us by them 
as of december   all installment payments against the cost of the plant have been completed and no amounts remain owing 
the agreement was amended in december to increase the production capacity of the plant to million us gallons per day 
the agreement expires on december   at which time we will have fulfilled our obligations under the agreement and we will be the sole owner and sole operator of the plant 
upon expiration of our agreement with ocean conversion  we expect that our operating costs at governor s harbour will decrease significantly 
in  we installed our second reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant  this one at our west bay site 
we own and are responsible for operation and maintenance of the west bay plant 
this plant is capable of producing  us gallons per day of potable water 
our operations under the license in the cayman islands the cayman islands government issued us an exclusive operational license under the water production and supply law of the license gives us the exclusive right to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman island 
the original twenty year license was renegotiated in and extended to expand our service area to include west bay 
the license terminates  unless further renewed  on july  two years prior to the expiration of the license  we have the right to negotiate with the government to extend the license for an additional term 
unless we are in default under the license  the government may not grant a license to any other party without first offering the license to us on terms that are no less favorable than those which the government offers to a third party 
we must provide  within our licensed area  any requested piped water service which  in the opinion of the executive council of the cayman islands government  is commercially feasible 
where supply is not considered commercially feasible  we may require the potential customer to contribute toward the capital costs of pipe laying 
we then repay these contributions to the customer  without interest  by way of a discount of on future billings for water sales until this indebtedness has been repaid 
we have been installing additional pipeline when we consider it to be commercially feasible  and the cayman islands government has never objected to our determination regarding commercial feasibility 
under the license  we pay a royalty to the government of of our gross potable water sales revenue 
the base selling price of water under the license presently varies between and per  us gallons  depending upon the type and location of the customer and the monthly volume of water purchased 
the license provides for an automatic adjustment for inflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary limited exceptions  and an automatic adjustment for the cost of electricity on a monthly basis 
the government reviews and approves the calculations of the price adjustments for inflation and electricity costs 
if we want to increase our prices for any reason other than inflation  we have to request prior approval of the executive council of the cayman islands government 
if the parties fail to agree  the matter is referred to arbitration 
the last price increase that we requested  other than automatic inflation adjustments since  was granted in full in june residential and commercial operations in the cayman islands we enter into standard contracts with hotels  condominiums and other properties located in our licensed area to provide potable water to such properties 
we currently have agreements on differing terms and rates to supply potable water to the room marriott hotel and the room westin hotel  and to supply non potable water to the safehaven golf course 
we bill on a monthly basis based on meter readings 
receivables are typically collected within or days after the billing date and receivables not collected within days subject the customer to disconnection from our water service 
in  we collected of our receivables 
customers who have had their service disconnected must pay re connection charges 
in the seven mile beach area  our primary customers are the hotels and condominium complexes which serve the tourists 
in the west bay area  our primary customers are residential homes 
occasionally  we also supply to  or buy from  on an as needed basis  the water authority cayman  which serves the business district of george town and other parts of grand cayman island 
wastewater services in the cayman islands we began providing sewerage services on grand cayman in the cayman islands government  through water authority cayman  constructed a public sewerage system in part of the seven mile beach area where governor s harbour is located 
on september   water authority cayman began processing sewage delivered by the pipelines and lift stations in that area 
we stopped our processing of sewage on that date 
water authority cayman currently directly bills our former sewerage customers for its services 
we have advised the cayman islands government that we do not intend to operate or maintain the system after march   after having extended a previous deadline of november  upon the request of the cayman islands government 
demand for water in the cayman islands in the past  demand on our pipeline distribution has varied throughout the year 
however  an increase in year round tourism in recent years has created more uniform demand for water throughout the year 
demand depends upon the number of tourists visiting the cayman islands and the amount of rainfall during any particular time of the year 
traditionally the highest demand arises in the first two quarters of the calendar year which corresponds with the high tourist season and the lowest demand arises in the third quarter of the year which corresponds with the period with the most rainfall and the least amount of tourist arrivals 
in general  of tourists come from the united states 
our operating results in any particular quarter are not indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year 
the table below lists the total volume of water we supplied on a quarterly basis for the years ended december     and to all our customers in thousands of us gallons first quarter      second quarter      third quarter      fourth quarter      total      our operations under the contract in belize we have entered into a contract with wasa to supply a minimum of  us gallons of water per day to wasa expiring in at the expiry of the contract  wasa may at its option extend the term of the agreement or purchase the plant outright 
the base price of water supplied  and adjustments thereto  are determined by the terms of the contract  which provides for adjustments based upon the movement in the government price indices specified in the contract  as well as  monthly adjustments for changes in the cost of fuel 
demand for water in belize we have not operated our plant in belize for a full year 
however we believe that water sales in belize will be cyclical  and on a similar cycle to sales in the cayman islands  since both operations cater to similar tourist markets 
we believe that water sales will be higher in the future since sales were limited before march because the production capacity of the water plant was lower than demand 
we have already generated sales in january and february which are higher than sales during the same period in while early sales indicate an increasing trend  it may not be indicative of similarly high percentage increases in the future because of production limitations in the first quarter of the total volume of water we supplied in thousands of us gallons to the water and sewage authority of belize in each of the third and fourth quarters of the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
water sales and other income total income our total income includes water sales income  other income and interest income from all of our business segments 
water sales income is comprised of water sales to our individual cayman islands customers and to the water and sewerage authority of belize 
other income consists of monthly meter rental charges  sales of water to trucks which deliver to customers not connected to our pipeline in the cayman islands  connection charges for new customers and re connection charges for delinquent accounts 
in april  we settled a dispute with the owner of the hyatt hotel and the developer of the britannia development  who supplied water to the hyatt hotel  a hotel located within our seven mile beach license area 
accordingly  other income also consists of settlement fee payments for the supply of water to the britannia development by the hyatt hotel  which has its own water production facility 
interest income relates to interest derived from excess cash balances placed on term deposit 
expenses expenses include cost of water sales direct production expenses and our indirect  or general and administrative expenses 
direct production expenses include royalty payments to the cayman islands government  electricity and chemical expenses  payments to ocean conversion relating to operation of the governor s harbour plant  production equipment and facility depreciation costs  equipment maintenance and expenses and operational staff costs 
indirect  or general and administrative expenses  consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits for personnel  administrative office lease payments  legal and professional expenses and financing costs 
there are no income taxes in the cayman islands and we are currently exempt from taxes in belize 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  water sales and other income total income total income increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
part of this increase is due to the income generated in a five month period ended december  by our newly acquired belize operation 
this income amounts to  which makes up of the increase 
the additional of the increase is due to a full twelve months of revenue from the hyatt settlement versus six months in  inflationary increase in base rates  as well as  generic growth in our customer base  due to increased housing and new hotel properties which came on line in our cayman islands franchise area 
expenses direct expenses increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
part of this increase is due to our newly acquired belize operation 
our direct expenses from belize  for the five month period ended december   amount to  which makes up of the increase 
the additional of the increase is due to costs of producing additional water to provide for the increased sales 
as a percentage of total income  direct expenses decreased from of total income to of total income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
indirect expenses increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
part of this increase is due to our indirect expenses from belize 
for the five month period ended december   indirect expenses from belize amounted to  which contributed to of the increase 
the additional of the increase is due to increase employment costs  increased professional fees due to the change in accounting policy and the voluntary increase of sec disclosure  increased financial and investor public relations and increased expenditures looking for new business 
as a percentage of total income  indirect expenses remained unchanged at of total income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  water sales and other income total income total income increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total income increased despite the closure of two hotels in may and august consisting of a total of rooms in the seven mile beach area 
the decline in available hotel rooms  in addition to year concerns over the christmas period  contributed to a corresponding decrease in tourist arrivals during the year 
in addition  our automatic inflation adjustment led to a slight decrease in prices for most of our customers in the west bay and seven mile beach areas 
the decline in water sales in the seven mile beach area  however  was more than offset by an increase in sales volume to new west bay customers and new six months of revenues from the hyatt settlement 
expenses direct expenses decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
direct expenses decreased primarily due to the termination of the united states filter contract  which immediately decreased costs at the west bay plant 
as a percentage of total income  direct expenses decreased from of total income to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
indirect expenses increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to substantial legal costs incurred in the first quarter of these legal costs principally relate to the final settlement of the britannia development lawsuit in april all legal costs were expensed as incurred 
other indirect costs  such as executive and administrative staff costs  rent and utilities  increased in line with inflation 
as a percentage of total income  indirect expenses increased from of total income to of total income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
change in accounting principle statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities requires start up costs to be expensed as incurred rather than deferred 
as a result  the cumulative effect of this change was  and this item was recorded as a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
liquidity and capital resources overview we generate cash from our plant operations at west bay  seven mile beach and ambergris caye  belize and from the sale of our shares and through our loans and facilities obtained from two banks 
cash flow from operating activities was provided by our plant operations  and is impacted by operating and maintenance expenses  the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases  excluding automatic adjustments to our rates for inflation and electricity costs  and various factors affecting tourism in the cayman islands and belize  such as weather conditions and the economy 
we use cash to fund our operations in the cayman islands and belize  to make payments under our operating agreement with ocean conversion for our governor s harbour plant  to expand our infrastructure  to pay dividends  to repay principal on our loans and to repurchase our shares when appropriate 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in was  compared to  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash generated from operations 
we expect cash from operating activities to continue to increase in as we continue to generate customer revenues from our belize operations acquired in july working capital at december   we had a working capital deficiency of  primarily due to the fourth quarter interim dividends payable which is recorded as a liability within accounts payable and other liabilities for unexercised stock option compensation costs 
management believes that sufficient resources  from funds generated by operations and existing unutilized credit lines  are available to maintain liquidity 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in was  compared to  in on july   we acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of seatec belize ltd  now renamed belize water ltd 
also in we purchased water production and distribution equipment to expand our infrastructure in the cayman islands 
in  investing activities consisted primarily of purchase of property  plant and equipment 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities in was  compared to cash used in of  in may and june  we completed a second public offering totaling  ordinary shares at a per share price of 
after deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses  our net proceeds from the offering was  we used the proceeds from this offering to retire approximately million of existing debt  for implementation of our growth strategy and for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
on december   our shareholders approved a share repurchase program 
as of december   we had repurchased  ordinary shares at an average cost of per share  and on january  we repurchased  shares at per share from a shareholder whose assets were being liquidated 
no other shares were repurchased during the year ended december  as of october   we suspended the open market repurchase of our shares 
our governor s harbour plant was financed  through a capital lease  by an increase in our long term water purchase obligation 
in  we financed the expansion of the water distribution system in the west bay area with a  loan issued by the european investment bank and our existing credit facility with the royal bank of canada 
the interest rate on the european investment bank loan is the bank s prevailing lending rate at the time of draw down less a subsidy of 
as of december    is outstanding under the european investment bank loan 
our total lending facility from the royal bank of canada comprises a revolving line of credit with a limit of  and term loans with a limit of  in  a term loan of  was drawn down 
we made an accelerated payment of  against this loan in using excess operating cash flow and repaid the outstanding amount of approximately  during the year ended december  from the proceeds of our second public share issue 
the royal bank of canada lending facility and the european investment bank loan are secured by all of our land and other assets 
during the year ended december   we declared three quarterly interim dividends of per share per quarter and an interim dividend of per share for the fourth quarter  compared to per share interim dividends declared in the first three quarters of and an interim dividend of per share for the forth quarter of material commitments for capital expenditures as at december   we had approximately  committed for capital expenditures for the bimini sands resort development 
these expenditures are for the construction of the plant site  as well as  installation of pipeline for distribution 
we intend to finance this project using existing credit facilities 
impact of inflation under the terms of our cayman islands license and belize water sales agreement  there is an automatic price adjustment for inflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary exceptions 
we therefore believe that the impact of inflation on our net income will not be material 
exchange rates the official exchange rate for conversion of united states dollars into cayman islands dollars has been fixed since at us per ci 
the official exchange rate for conversion of united states dollars into belizian dollars has been fixed since at us per bze 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements we are subject to the following recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
among other things  sab discusses the sec staff s view on accounting for connection fees received from customers 
we have determined that sab does not impact our revenue recognition policy and that no adjustments arise from compliance with this pronouncement 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion was effective july  this interpretation clarifies the application of apb opinion for certain issues 
we have determined that the interpretation does not impact our treatment of stock compensation and that no adjustments arise from compliance with this pronouncement 
forward looking statements we discuss in this annual report and in documents which we have incorporated into this annual report by reference matters which are not historical facts  but which are forward looking statements 
we intend these forward looking statements to qualify for safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  our future plans  objectives  expectations and events  assumptions and estimates about our company and our industry in general 
the forward looking statements in this annual report reflect what we currently anticipate will happen 
what actually happens could differ materially from what we currently anticipate will happen 
we are not promising to make any public announcement when we think forward looking statements in this annual report are no longer accurate whether as a result of new information  what actually happens in the future or for any other reason 
important matters that may affect what will actually happen include  but are not limited to  tourism in the cayman islands  belize and bahamas  scheduled new construction within our operating areas  the us  cayman islands  belize and bahamas economies  regulatory matters  weather conditions in the cayman islands  belize and bahamas  availability of capital for expansion of our operations  and other factors described in the risk factors section below as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
risk factors we have described for you below some risks which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we rely on an exclusive license in the cayman islands which may not be renewed in the future and under which we must obtain prior approval for an increase in our rates for any reason other than inflation 
we presently operate as a public water utility under an exclusive license originally issued to us in december by the government of the cayman islands 
we own our production infrastructure and substantially all of our distribution infrastructure 
our license expires on july  if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those which the government offers to a third party 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the government will renew our license or that we will be able to negotiate a new license on satisfactory terms 
under our license  we must obtain prior approval from the cayman islands government to increase our rates for any reason other than inflation 
our ability to raise our rates is limited by this requirement  including potential delays and costs involved in obtaining government approval for a rate increase 
our business is affected by tourism  weather conditions  the cayman islands economy  the belize economy and the us economy 
tourist arrivals and weather conditions within our operating areas impact the demand for our water 
normally  the highest demand is in the first two quarters of each calendar year  which corresponds with the high tourist season 
lowest demand for water arises in the third quarter of each calendar year  which corresponds with the period with the most rainfall and the least tourist arrivals 
approximately of tourists to the cayman islands come from the us in addition  development activity in the cayman islands often decreases during downturns in the us economy  which is tracked by the cayman islands economy 
accordingly  a significant downturn in tourist arrivals to the cayman islands or in the us economy for any reason would be detrimental to our revenues and operating results 
as a result of the seasonal nature of our operations  the revenues and profitability we achieve in any one quarter is not indicative of our expected profitability for a full fiscal year 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
even though we have an exclusive license for our present service area  our ability to expand our service area in the cayman islands is limited at the discretion of the cayman islands government 
further  part of our long term growth strategy is to expand our water supply and distribution operations to locations outside the cayman islands  such as belize and the bahamas 
our expansion into new locations depends on our ability to identify suitable new service territories and to obtain necessary permits and licenses to operate in these territories 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy our capital requirements for expansion in the cayman islands  belize and bahamas for the next twelve months  we will need additional financing to further expand our operations elsewhere 
we cannot make any assurances to you that we will be able to obtain the additional financing which we may need to expand our operations on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our expansion to territories outside our current operations includes significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following o regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations and currency controls  o risks related to operating in foreign countries  including political instability  reliance on local economies  environmental or geographical problems  shortages of materials and skilled labor  and o risks related to development of new operations  including assessing the demand for water  engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled 
if our expansion plans are successful  we may have difficulties in managing our growth outside our current operations 
expanding our operations to areas outside the cayman islands  belize and bahamas will require us to hire and train new personnel  expand our management information systems and control our operating expenses 
we cannot currently estimate the costs required or assure you that any new operations outside our current operations will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not negatively impact our overall profitability 
our operations in the caribbean could be harmed by hurricanes 
the cayman islands  belize and bahamas  like the rest of the caribbean  are susceptible to damage from hurricanes 
a significant hurricane could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties 
this would result in decreased revenues from water sales until the damaged equipment and properties are repaired and the tourism industry returned to the status quo before the hurricane 
we are not fully insured against hurricane damage 
the cayman islands have been directly hit by one hurricane since we began operations in and belize has been directly hit by one hurricane since we began operations on july   and the damage to our properties and equipment was minimal 
we are not fully insured on our underground water distribution system on the cayman islands  or the governor s harbour reservoirs which are constructed from earthen berms  although we are fully insured on all of our other above ground property and equipment including our reverse osmosis equipment  machinery  other equipment  buildings and the west bay reservoir tanks at their estimated replacement value 
we will evaluate our needs and obtain the insurance coverage that we believe is necessary for any new operations outside our current operating areas 
a severe hurricane which resulted in major damage to our properties and equipment could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
even though we are not fully insured  we have mitigated the risks by implementing disaster recovery plans and obtaining insurance for loss of revenue 
we could be negatively affected by potential government actions and regulations 
there is always a possibility that the government may issue legislation or adopt new regulations o restricting foreign ownership of our company  o providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  o providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  o providing for different water quality standards  o resulting in unilateral changes to or renegotiation of our exclusive license or water supply contracts  or o causing currency exchange fluctuations or devaluations or changes in tax laws 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
service of process on our company and our directors and officers  nine out of twelve of whom reside outside the united states  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
also  since substantially all of our assets are located in the cayman islands  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states 
civil liabilities under the securities act of or the securities exchange act of for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
there is no reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  so foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
any action would have to overcome available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  but not limited to o lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts including competent jurisdiction according to the rules of private international law currently in effect in the cayman islands  o lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding  o that united states judgments or their enforcement are contrary to the law  public policy  natural justice  security or sovereignty of the cayman islands  o that united states judgments were obtained by fraud or conflict with any other valid judgment in the same matter between the same parties  and o that proceedings between the same parties in the same matter were pending in a cayman islands court at the time the lawsuit was instituted in the united states court 
a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any action in the courts of the cayman islands for example  treble damages  which would probably be regarded as penalties  probably would not be enforceable under any circumstances 
we rely heavily on the efforts of several key employees 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of jeffrey parker  our chairman and chief executive officer  at any time could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
although mr 
parker has entered into an employment agreement extending until december   which extend automatically every year for an additional one year term  we cannot guarantee that mr 
parker will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement 
also  none of our employees has entered into a non compete agreement with us 
provisions in our articles of association  requirements of government approval and an option deed adopted by our board of directors may discourage a change in control of our company and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares 
an issuance or transfer of a number of shares which a exceeds of the issued shares of our company  or b would  upon registration  result in any shareholder owning more than of the issued shares  requires the prior approval of the cayman islands government 
it may be difficult for a shareholder to acquire more than of our shares and be able to influence significantly our board of directors or obtain a controlling equity interest in our company and change our management and policies 
our articles of association include provisions which may discourage or prevent a change in control of our company 
for instance  our board of directors consists of three groups 
each group serves a staggered term of three years before the directors in the group are up for re election 
also  the board of directors may refuse to register any transfer of shares on our books 
this provision of the articles of association ensures that the board of directors is not legally obligated to register a share transfer which would cause us to be in breach of the government license in the cayman islands as discussed above 
our board of directors has never refused to approve the registration of the transfer of shares 
we have also adopted an option deed  which is similar to a poison pill 
the option deed will discourage a change in control of our company by causing substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire our company on terms not approved by the board of directors 
as a result of these provisions which discourage or prevent an unfriendly or unapproved change in control of our company  you may not have an opportunity to sell your ordinary shares at a higher market price  which  at least temporarily  typically accompanies attempts to acquire control of a company through a tender offer  open market purchases or otherwise 
we are in technical breach of the terms of our license 
as stated above  our cayman islands license requires that government approves in advance any issuance or transfer of ordinary shares which represents more than of the issued shares  or which would increase the ownership of any shareholder above of the issued shares of our company 
more than of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares are and in the future may be registered in the name of cede and co 
cede and co 
is the nominee for the depository trust company  otherwise know as dtc  which is a clearing agency for shares held by participating banks and brokers 

we do not believe that these shareholdings by cede and co 
constitute a breach of the intent of the license 
we believe that the purpose of this clause of the license is to allow the government to approve significant shareholders of the company 
cede and co 
and depository trust company  however  act solely as the nominee for banks and brokers  and have no beneficial ownership in the ordinary shares of common stock 
nevertheless  our cayman islands legal counsel has advised us that these shareholdings by cede co  which were not approved by the government  are probably a technical breach of its license 
on june   we received a letter from an official of the cayman islands government stating that a public offering which we completed in without government approval was a breach of our license 
we have responded to this letter and stated that we do not believe that we are in breach of our license 
a meeting with officials of the cayman islands government  to discuss this matter  was held on june  in accordance with the government s suggestion in the june st letter 
discussion of the matter is ongoing as of the date of this annual report 
we have been advised by our cayman islands legal counsel that this letter does not constitute a formal notice of breach as contemplated in the license 
however  if a court determined that the government s approval of these offerings was required under the license  we would be in breach of the license 
our legal counsel has advised us that in order to make this determination  a court would have to disagree with our interpretation of the license and dismiss several defenses that would be available to us 
these defenses include acquiescence and waiver on the part of the government with respect to these offerings 
there may be a risk of variation in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenue is earned in both cayman islands dollars and belizian dollars 
the cayman islands dollar is presently fixed at us per ci and the belizian dollar is presently fixed at us per bze 
these rates of exchange have been fixed since and respectively 
as a result  we do not hedge against any exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
however  if either of the fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate  our results of operations could be affected 
shares eligible for future sale under rule of the securities act may adversely affect the market price of the ordinary shares 
as of march   there were  ordinary shares issued and outstanding
