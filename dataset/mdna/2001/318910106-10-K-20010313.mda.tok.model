analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  occupancy expense  equipment expense and other overhead costs  as well as the effects of income taxes 
restatement of prior period results and discussion of nonrecurring items of income and expense the results of operations for the year were significantly impacted by the company s merger acquisition of first savings 
as noted above  in accordance with pooling of interests accounting requirements  all financial results of the company have been restated to include the operations of first savings 
in addition  there were several material nonrecurring items of income and expense related to the merger  as follows o  in expenses  after tax that were incurred in completing the september  merger with first savings 
these expenses consisted primarily of investment banker fees  attorney fees  employment contract payments  accountant fees  and early termination fees associated with vendor contracts 
these expenses were all recorded in the third quarter of o  in losses  after tax from sales of securities 
the merger with first savings increased the company s liability sensitive position 
to reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure  approximately million in securities were sold at a total loss of  the proceeds from the sale were first used to repay short term debt  with the remaining proceeds invested in investments with a shorter average life and a higher yield than the securities sold 
o  was recorded  after tax as a one time adjustment to the allowance for loan losses during the third quarter of this provision for loan losses was recorded in order to align the credit risk methodologies of the company and first savings 
o  was realized as a gain  after tax from the sale of the company s carthage branch during the fourth quarter of the sale of this branch was a regulatory requirement for approval of the merger with first savings 
while less significant in amount  the years and also contained items of a nonrecurring nature 
nonrecurring items are items that are not a part of the company s day to day operations and include items such as merger related expenses  gains and losses from securities sales  loan sales  fixed assets  other real estate  and other items of a similar nature 
the following table presents a summary of items for each of the past three years that are nonrecurring in nature 
the impact on net income and impact on diluted earnings per share columns reflect the after tax amount of the nonrecurring item at the blended federal and state tax rate

excluding the nonrecurring items discussed above  recurring net income for the year ended december  amounted to  an increase from the  in recurring net income for the recurring net income amounted to basic earnings per share of  a increase from the basic earnings per share in diluted earnings per share on a recurring basis for amounted to  a increase from the recurring diluted earnings per share amount of reported for the increase in recurring earnings is primarily a result of the growth the company has experienced in its loan and deposit bases 
in  loans grew by and deposits grew by 
additionally since january   the company s loans have grown by a total of and deposits have increased by 
the effect of recognizing the net interest income on a full twelve months of the loan and deposit growth  as well as the incremental impact of the growth  resulted in an increase in net interest income of in compared to partially offsetting the effects of the loan and deposit growth on net interest income was a slight decrease in the company s net interest margin from in to in the company s provision for loan losses amounted to  in compared to  in as noted above  a provision for loan losses of  was recorded at the time of the merger with first savings to align the credit risk methodologies of the two companies 
excluding this one time provision  the provision for loan losses amounted to  in  a increase over the  recorded for this increase in the provision for loan losses is consistent with higher loan growth experienced in compared to in  loans outstanding increased by million compared to net loan growth of million in asset quality indicators remained strong in reported noninterest income for was  compared to  reported for noninterest income for was significantly impacted by the merger with first savings as a result of losses from securities sales that were executed to reposition the company s bond portfolio  as well as a gain realized from the sale of a branch that was required to be divested to gain regulatory approval 
core noninterest income  which excludes the merger related items discussed above  as well as gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  increased  or  during  from  in to  in the increase in core noninterest income was associated with the general growth of the company 
reported noninterest expense for amounted to  compared to  for the year included  in merger expenses incurred in connection with the merger with first savings 
excluding the merger related expenses  noninterest expense amounted to  an increase from the increase in noninterest expense was also associated with the general growth of the company 
the company s income taxes decreased from  in to  in the decrease in income tax expense was a result of lower income before income taxes  which was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate that was caused by the nondeductibility of certain merger related expenses 
overview compared to net income for amounted to  an increase over the  recorded in the net income amounted to basic earnings per share of  a increase from the basic earnings per share in diluted earnings per share for amounted to  a increase from the reported for nonrecurring items of income and expense did not have a significant effect on net income for either year 
comparing to  increases of were experienced in net interest income  noninterest income  and noninterest expenses as a result of growth in the company s business 
loans increased and deposits increased during partially offsetting the positive effects that growth in loans in deposits has on net interest income and net income was a decrease in the company s net interest margin from in to in due to lower loan growth experienced during the year  the company s provision for loan losses in was lower compared to  amounting to  compared to the amount of  the company s effective tax rate during was compared to an effective rate of in the reduction in the effective tax rate was largely due to the favorable tax treatment of the company s real estate investment trust first troy 
net interest income net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to  in   in  and  in table analyzes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in as illustrated in table  these increases in net interest income were primarily a result of increases in the amount of average loans and deposits outstanding when comparing to and to in  the average amount of loans outstanding grew by  while the average amount of deposits increased by 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding increased and the average amount of deposits outstanding increased 
the effects of the increases in average loans and deposits on taxable equivalent net interest income in both and were partially offset by a slight narrowing of the company s interest rate spread 
the company s net interest margin net yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points to in compared to in s net interest margin of was basis points lower than the margin realized in the company s interest rate spread the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities also declined  with a decrease of basis points in to from in s interest rate spread of was basis points lower than the realized in the decrease in the net interest margin and spread is primarily related to the company s increasing reliance on higher cost sources of funding 
in  average time deposits greater than  and borrowings the two highest cost source of funds for the company comprised of the company s average total funding sources 
in  the average percentage of these higher cost funds to total funds increased to  and in the percentage was 
the increased reliance on higher cost funding sources has been due to the need to fund the strong loan demand experienced by the company 
see additional information regarding net interest income on page in the section entitled interest rate risk 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the company made provisions for loan losses of  in compared to  in and  in as noted earlier  in connection with the merger with first savings  a provision for  was recorded in order to align the risk methodologies of the two merging companies 
excluding the merger related provision  the company recorded loan loss provisions of  in  a increase over the provision of  with asset quality remaining relatively stable and strong during   and  the variance in the provision for loan losses for each year has been due primarily to variances in the amount of loan growth experienced 
net new loan growth for amounted to million compared to million in  thus resulting in the higher provision in compared to the million in net loan growth during was less than the million net loan growth experienced in  thus resulting in the lower provision in compared to see the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the company s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income recorded by the company amounted to  in   in  and  in the decrease in noninterest income for was due to losses incurred from sales of securities that were made in relation to the merger acquisition of first savings see additional discussion below 
as shown in table  core noninterest income  which excludes gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  as well as nonrecurrring items  amounted to  in  an increase of over the  recorded in the core noninterest income of  was higher than the  recorded in see table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased in to  from  in the amount of  was higher than the amount of  the majority of charges in this category relate to fees earned on transaction accounts 
therefore changes in this account generally track the changes in the amount of transaction accounts held by the company 
average transaction deposit accounts increased in and in other service charges  commissions and fees amounted to  in  a increase from the  earned in the amount of  was higher than the  recorded in this category of noninterest income includes items such as safety deposit box rentals  check cashing fees  credit card and merchant income  and atm surcharges  and is thus more dependent on the overall level of total customers of the company 
this category of income grew primarily because of increases in these activity related fee services as a result of overall growth in the company s total customer base 
fees from presold mortgages amounted to  in  a decrease from the amount of  the amount was substantially the same as the  earned in the decrease in these fees in compared to and was due to the significantly higher interest rate environment in effect during higher interest rates generally reduce mortgage origination activity  particularly refinancings 
the average prime rate in was compared to in and in commissions from sales of credit insurance amounted to  in compared to  in and  in the changes in this line item over that three year period have been primarily due to fluctuations in the experience bonus paid to the company from the company that provides the credit life insurance that the company earns commissions from selling 
the amount of any experience bonus payment is computed once per year and is dependent on the actual loss experience on credit insurance policies that the company sold 
in the first quarter of  the company received an experience bonus of  compared to  received in the first quarter of  while no bonus was received in data processing fees amounted to  in   in  and  in as noted earlier  montgomery data makes its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
montgomery data did not have any nonaffiliated customers from december to december in december  a contract was signed to provide data processing for a nearby de novo bank 
since that time  montgomery data has added three additional nonaffiliated clients 
assuming montgomery data retains all four nonaffiliated customers for  the company estimates that gross revenue related to those customers will be approximately  noninterest income not defined as core amounted to net losses of  in compared to gains of  in  and gains of  during the net losses of  recorded in primarily related to two merger related events a  loss resulting from a restructuring of the combined company s investment portfolio and an  gain realized from the fourth quarter sale of a branch that was required to be divested in order to gain regulatory approval 
at the time of the merger  the company analyzed the combined investment portfolio in relation to its overall asset liability management 
the merger with first savings increased the company s liability sensitive position 
to reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure  approximately million in available for sale securities were sold at a total loss of  during the third quarter of the proceeds from the sale were first used to repay short term debt  with the remaining proceeds invested in investments with a shorter average life and a higher yield than the securities sold 
partially offsetting the  in losses related to this transaction were net gains of  primarily related to gains realized from the second quarter sale of equity securities that were received as a result of an investment in a north carolina partnership that promoted new business in the state 
net noncore noninterest income of  realized in primarily was comprised of immaterial gains and losses from sales of securities and loans 
noncore noninterest income in amounting to  primarily related to loan sale gains of  transacted by the company in order to manage the significant loan growth experienced in  as well as to maintain a proper balance between the amount of loans and deposits that the company maintained 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were  compared to  in and  in table presents the components of the company s noninterest expense during the past three years 
the noninterest expense recorded in includes  in merger expenses 
these expenses consisted primarily of investment banker fees  attorney fees  employment contract payments  accountant fees  and early termination fees associated with vendor contracts 
these expenses were all recorded in the third quarter of excluding merger expenses  noninterest expenses recorded by the company in amounted to  an increase from the  recorded in the amount represented a increase over the  recorded in the increases in noninterest expenses in the past two years occurred in almost all categories and were due primarily to the company s growth 
the company incurred higher expenses in order to properly process  manage  and service the increase in loans and increase in deposits that have occurred over the past two years 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the decrease in tax expense in compared to is a result of a decrease in pretax income  which was partially offset by an increase in the company s effective tax rate from in to in the increase in the effective tax rate for is due to the nondeductibility for tax purposes of certain merger expenses 
the increase in tax expense in compared to is a result of a increase in pretax income  which was partially offset by a reduction in the company s effective tax rate from in to in the reduction in the effective tax rate for is largely due to the favorable tax treatment of the company s real estate investment trust first troy 
table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates 
analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition overview over the past two years the company has experienced strong loan growth  with loans increasing by million  or  in and million  or  in deposit growth  while strong by industry standards  has not occurred at comparable rates 
deposits outstanding grew million  or  in and million  or  in the company believes higher loan demand compared to deposit growth has been caused by several factors including economic expansion coupled with lower consumer savings rates  increased competition for deposits  new types of competitors for deposits including brokerage houses and the internet  and the stock market being increasingly viewed as a savings vehicle 
the higher loan growth when compared to deposit growth has resulted in a reduction of the company s liquidity 
the company has increased its use of borrowings over the past two years  reduced its investment portfolio  and  in an effort to fund loan growth as much as possible with deposits  has aggressively priced large time deposits 
the increased use of borrowings and large time deposits has impacted the company s net interest margin  as discussed above 
asset quality has been strong over the past three years 
the company s market area  the central piedmont region of north carolina  has had a healthy economy in recent years  with low unemployment rate and low business failure rate 
the company does not participate in large syndicated credits that have resulted in large credit losses at several other north carolina based banks 
the company s and bank s capital ratios are strong and far exceed the minimum regulatory thresholds for classification as a well capitalized institution 
distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the most significant variance in this table is the relative increase in loans compared to total assets 
the higher reliance on time deposits greater than  and borrowings over the past two years can also be seen in this table the level of borrowings at december  was affected by excess borrowings obtained for yk liquidity concerns 
securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
the investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in securities in was primarily due to the sale of million in securities at a loss of million discussed earlier  most of which was not reinvested into securities  but rather used to pay down debt and invested in overnight investments 
in addition  a portion of the securities portfolio that matured during the year was used to fund loan growth 
the increase in securities held at december  compared to december  was primarily due to a higher level of borrowings million in compared to million in  the proceeds of which were partially invested in securities 
over the past three years  the composition of the securities portfolio has not varied significantly  with the majority of the securities comprised of us government agencies and mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies 
these two categories of investments generally provide the company with the preferred balance of yield and credit quality 
included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  the cmo s that the company has invested in are substantially all early tranche pieces of the cmo 
at december   net unrealized gains of  were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale compared to a net unrealized loss of  at december  and a net unrealized gain of  at december  approximately half of the favorable  change experienced in in the unrealized gain loss position of the available for sale portfolio was due to the company realizing million in losses in connection with the merger related security sale  while the other half was due to an increase in the value of the bond holdings as a result of the lower interest rate environment in effect at the end of the  unfavorable change in the unrealized gain loss position of the available for sale portfolio experienced in was caused by the generally rising rate environment experienced in management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains losses  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as of december    and  respectively 
the fair value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  was less than the carrying value at december  and by  and  respectively 
management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  mortgage backed securities  by nature  have lives that are shorter than their contractual life due to prepayment volatility and monthly returns of principal 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds  the maturity date for all other non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities  was years 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds  the maturity date for all other non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities  was years 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
other than the collateralized mortgage obligations previously discussed  the company owned no securities considered by regulatory authorities to be derivative instruments 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
the loan portfolio is the largest category of the company s earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans  real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  and consumer loans 
the company restricts virtually all of its lending to its county market area  which is located in the central piedmont region of north carolina 
the diversity of the region s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment 
loans increased by million  or  in to million from the million held at december  the year end amount was million  or  higher than the million balance at december  the majority of the and loan growth occurred in loans secured by real estate  with approximately million  or in and million  or  in of the net loan growth occurring in real estate mortgage or real estate construction loans 
over the years  the company s loan mix has remained fairly consistent  with real estate loans mortgage and construction comprising approximately of the loan portfolio  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans comprising  and consumer installment loans comprising approximately of the portfolio 
at december   million or of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total real estate loans  in loans secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total real estate loans  in loans secured by liens on other types of real estate 
the company s million in real estate mortgage loans can be further classified as follows o million  or  are traditional residential mortgage loans in which the borrower s personal income is the primary repayment source 
o million  or  are primarily dependent on cash flow from a commercial business for repayment 
o million  or  are for personal consumer installment loans in which the borrower has provided real estate as collateral 
o million  or  are for real estate construction loans 
o million  or  are home equity loans 
o million  or  are primarily dependent on cash flow from agricultural crop sales 
table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately 
approximately of the company s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and  respectively  as of december  the company intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and other real estate 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no such loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the placing of loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to   and  at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in nonperforming loans over the past two years has been primarily due to a decrease in nonaccrual loans  as restructured loans have not changed significantly 
the decrease in nonaccrual loans from december  to december  was primarily a result of a  loan that was paid off during the second quarter of  and the removal of substantially all of the nonaccrual loans on the books at december  by reason of payoff  charge off  foreclosure  or return to accrual status  with a lower amount of loans being placed on nonaccrual status during as of december   the largest nonaccrual balance to any one borrower was  with the average balance for the nonaccrual loans being approximately  if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in   and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that  in management s opinion  have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts included above  management believes that an estimated million of large loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at december  had the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
approximately million of the potential problem loans just discussed relate to one borrower that has liquidity problems 
the loans related to this borrower are collateralized by real estate  the value of which the company believes exceeds the outstanding loan balance 
the borrower has been actively selling the real estate to pay down the loan balance 
however  several real estate sales scheduled for did not occur due to the filing of a lawsuit against the borrower during the first quarter of as a result of this development  management determined that million in loans related to this borrower should be placed on nonaccrual status  and they were classified as such in february loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
other real estate includes foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties 
other real estate totaled  at december  compared to  at december   and  at december  other real estate represented   and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the increase in the level of other real estate at december  compared to december  primarily relates to the reclassification of two bank branches that were closed during from premises and equipment to other real estate 
the company s management has reviewed recent appraisals of its other real estate and believes that their fair values  less estimated costs to sell  exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented 
allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions 
the company uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the company s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at december  compared to  as of december  and  at december  this represented   and  of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans amounted to at december   compared to at december  and at december  as noted above  a million loan relationship was placed on nonaccrual status subsequent to december  if this loan had been classified as nonaccrual at december   the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans would have been 
table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to specific loan types in the loan portfolio increased from  at december  to  at december  the december  allocated amount of  was an increase from the december  amount of  the increase in the allocated amount during was primarily due to loan growth and the company segregating and assigning higher reserve percentages to particular loan types that were identified during as having inherently higher risk 
these additional risk characteristics were noted by management as a part of its ongoing analysis and review of its loan portfolio and historical charge off experience  and did not result from any deterioration of the portfolio which developed during the increase in the allocated amounts for was primarily due to growth in the company s loan portfolio 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the company maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans  but rather is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the overall portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
the general increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses through was consistent with overall loan growth  while the decrease in was primarily associated with the higher risk percentages assigned to a portion of the loan portfolio discussed above 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by category  and additions to the allowance that have been charged to expense 
the company s net loan charge offs were approximately  in   in  and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and  respectively 
deposits the average amounts of deposits of the company and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended december   and are presented in table average deposits grew million or in to million 
average deposits for grew million  or  over the average to million 
average time deposits greater than  experienced the highest percentage growth of any of the deposit categories in each of the past two years 
in  average time deposits greater than  increased million  or  while in these deposits increased million  or 
time deposits in denominations of less than  was the other major component of average deposit growth during with growth of million  or  during the year 
the primary reason for the high growth within these categories of deposits is that the company began more competitively pricing time deposits in order to help fund the strong loan growth experienced in both years 
time deposits are generally more rate sensitive than the other categories of deposits  and thus can be more easily accumulated by more aggressively pricing their rates 
as noted above  in each of the past three years  the company s growth in deposits has not keep pace with loan growth 
the company believes higher loan demand compared to deposit growth has been caused by several factors including economic expansion coupled with lower consumer savings rates  increased competition for deposits  new types of competitors for deposits including brokerage houses and the internet  and the stock market being increasingly viewed as a savings vehicle 
accordingly  the company anticipates that  in order to continue to provide funding for loan growth  it will have to continue to aggressively price deposits  particularly time deposits  and that heavier reliance on alternative funding sources may be necessary 
as of december   the company held approximately million in time deposits of  or more and other time deposits of million 
table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  this table shows that of the company s time deposits greater than  mature within one year 
the company does not issue any time deposits through foreign offices  nor does the company believe that it holds any deposits by foreign depositors 
borrowings the company has three sources of borrowing capacity an approximately million line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s frb discount window 
the company s line of credit with the fhlb totaling approximately million can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings  depending on the particular funding or liquidity need and is secured by the company s fhlb stock and a blanket lien on its one to four family residential loan portfolio 
as of december   million of the million in outstanding fhlb borrowings were due within one year and million were due beyond one year 
the company had a total of million in borrowings outstanding at december   with million of those borrowings being due within one year 
the higher level of borrowings outstanding at december  was due to the company s yk liquidity plan  as well as the company s use of a portion of the proceeds from the merger related security sale see above to pay down outstanding borrowings 
the company also has a correspondent bank relationship established that allows the company to purchase up to million in federal funds on an overnight  unsecured basis 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under this line at december  or there was insignificant use of this line for the three years ended december   and  with total interest expense incurred amounting to approximately  each year 
during  the company established a line of credit with the frb discount window 
this line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the company s commercial  consumer and real estate portfolio not including family 
based on the collateral owned by the company as of december   the available line of credit is approximately million 
this line of credit was established primarily in connection with the company s yk liquidity contingency plan 
this line of credit has not been drawn on since inception and subsequent to december   the frb stated that it would not expect lines of credit that have been granted to financial institutions to be a primary borrowing source 
the company plans to maintain this line of credit  although it is not expected that it will be drawn upon except in unusual circumstances 
the total amount of average borrowings was million in compared to million in and million in as noted in deposits above  the company expects it to be increasingly difficult to fund all loan growth with deposits 
accordingly  the company expects average borrowings to continue to increase 
average short term borrowings for each year presented were less than thirty percent of total shareholders equity at each period 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains additional information regarding the company s borrowings 
interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past five years the company s net interest margin has ranged from a low of realized in to a high of realized in 
during that five year period the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of to a high of 
table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   using stated maturities for all instruments except mortgage backed securities which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called which are shown in the period of their expected call 
as illustrated by this table  the company has million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities at december  subject to interest rate changes within one year are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that in the near term twelve months  net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates 
generally  when rates change  the company s interest sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change  while the company s interest sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full amount of the rate change 
the net effect is that in the twelve month horizon  as rates change  the impact of having a higher level of interest sensitive liabilities is substantially negated by the later and typically lower proportionate change they experience compared to interest sensitive assets 
while the company can not guarantee stability in its net interest margin in the future  at this time management does not expect significant fluctuations 
however  assuming a static interest rate environment  the company does expect that its net interest margin will continue to experience gradual pressure because of continued difficulties expected in growing deposits at their historical rate spreads and at rates sufficient to fund loan growth  which could result in additional reliance on the higher funding costs to the company which generally carry higher rates than deposits 
see additional discussion in the section entitled deposits above 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes  nor does it maintain any foreign currency positions 
table presents the expected maturities of the company s other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments 
table also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the difference between the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the company s market sensitive assets and market sensitive liabilities is not material  with each varying by less than 
see additional discussion regarding net interest income  as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin in the section entitled net interest income above 
off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  that are not reflected in the financial statements 
as of december   the company had outstanding loan commitments of  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
additionally  standby letters of credit of approximately  and  were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the company s exposure to credit loss for the aforementioned commitments in the event of nonperformance by the party to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
however  management believes that these commitments represent no more than the normal lending risk that the company commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the company plans to obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
the types of collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory and commercial or residential real estate 
management expects any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations 
the company is not involved in any legal proceedings that  in management s opinion  could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the company 
off balance sheet derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company does not engage in off balance sheet derivatives activities

liquidity the company s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and to maintain required reserve levels  pay expenses and operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary liquidity sources are net income from operations  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the company s securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash 
in addition to internally generated liquidity sources  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the following three sources an approximately million line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window 
see the section above entitled borrowings for additional detail about these credit lines 
although the company has not historically had to rely on these sources of credit as a source of liquidity but has chosen to do so at various times instead of selling securities  the company has experienced an increase in its loan to deposit ratio over the past three years  from at december  to at december  to at december  to at december   as a result of strong loan growth that has outpaced deposit growth 
this strong loan growth has reduced the company s liquidity sources 
at december   balance sheet assets that are generally regarded as being liquid consisting of cash  due from banks  federal funds sold  presold mortgages in process of settlement and securities amounted to of total deposits and borrowings 
at december   this percentage had been reduced to 
although liquidity has lessened in recent years  the company s management believes its liquidity sources  including unused lines of credit  are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet its operating needs 
capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  the two primary components affecting shareholders equity are net income  which increases shareholders equity  and dividends declared  which decreases shareholders equity 
in  net income of  increased equity  while dividends declared of  reduced equity 
in  two other items had a significant effect on shareholders equity other comprehensive income  which for the company is comprised entirely of the change in the unrealized gain or loss of the company s available for sale securities and amounted to  in see additional information in the securities discussion above and purchases and retirement of common stock  which amounted to  in in december  the company announced that its board of directors had authorized stock repurchases for up to  shares of the company s common stock 
this authorization was designed to provide the company flexibility in managing its capital and enhance shareholder value 
approximately  shares of the company s common stock were repurchased under this authorization during the first four months of at an average price of 
prior to the company s acquisition of first savings  this authorization was rescinded 
on october   the company announced an agreement to acquire century bancorp in a part cash part stock transaction 
in connection with this transaction  the company announced its intent to repurchase up to the number of shares that is expected to be issued to complete the acquisition approximately  shares 
subsequent to the date of the announcement and through december   the company repurchased approximately  shares at an average cost of 
in addition to the items noted above that affected shareholders equity in  the company received proceeds of  in connection with the issuance of  shares related to exercises of stock options  issued  shares and received  in proceeds from issuances of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  and recorded a  increase to equity related to the tax benefit that the company realized due to exercises of nonqualified stock options 
the company is regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve board fed and is subject to securities registration and public reporting regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the bank is regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the north carolina office of the commissioner of banks 
the company is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the company and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the fed and fdic 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
these capital standards require the company and the bank to maintain minimum ratios of tier capital to total risk weighted assets tier i capital ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets of and total capital ratio  respectively 
tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale  less intangible assets  and total capital is comprised of tier capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the company and the bank is the allowance for loan losses 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the company and the bank  adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in fed and fdic regulations 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements described above  the company and the bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement  which calls for a minimum ratio of tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets leverage ratio of to  depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators 
the fed has not advised the company of any requirement specifically applicable to it 
table presents the company s regulatory capital ratios as of december    and in addition to the minimum capital requirements described above  the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank s classification as well capitalized 
the specific guidelines are as follows tier i capital ratio of at least  total capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least 
the bank s regulatory ratios are not materially different from the company s ratios  and thus exceeded the threshold for well capitalized status at december   and due to the increase in assets and the addition of intangible assets that will be recorded in connection with the company s pending acquisition of century bancorp and the four first union branches  regulatory capital ratios will be significantly impacted 
if the acquisitions had taken place on december   the company estimates that the tier i capital ratio would have been  the total risk based capital ratio would have been  and the leverage capital ratio would have been  all of which would have continued to exceed the minimum required regulatory ratios 
see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
inflation since the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses 
current accounting matters the company prepares its financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by  among others  the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic  the fasb frequently issues new rules and proposed new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities 
the fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
this statement  as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   and was adopted by the company on january  on january   the company transferred held to maturity securities with an amortized cost of approximately million to the available for sale category at fair value as allowed by sfas no 
such transfers from the held to maturity category at the date of initial adoption shall not call into question the company s intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future 
the unrealized loss at the time of the transfer was approximately  the company does not engage in any hedging activities and other than the aforementioned transfer of securities  the adoption of the statement had no impact on the company 
the fasb has also issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of fasb statement no 
it revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
this statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  this statement is effective for the recognition and reclassification of collateral and disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december  this statement is not expected to materially impact the company
