factors which may affect future operations this annual report includes discussions of its long term growth outlook  including various forward looking statements 
the following risks and uncertainties  among others  could affect the degree to which such expectations are realized 
dependence on major customers 
while the company is focusing efforts on broadening its reseller  distribution and oem sales channels  sales to a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s revenue 
the company believes that its dependence on a similarly few number of customers will continue during this concentration of customers may cause revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on major customers requirements and the timing of their orders and shipments 
the company s agreements with its customers generally do not include minimum purchase commitments or exclusivity arrangements 
the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if any present or future major customer were to choose to reduce its level of orders  were to change to another vendor for purchases of a similar product  were to combine their operations with another company who had an established relationship with another vendor for purchases of a similar product  were to experience financial  operational or other difficulties or were to delay paying or fail to pay amounts due the company 
early in  picturetel reported that it is experiencing financial difficulties 
reduced demand for traditional videoconferencing products 
traditional videoconferencing technology such as isdn has had a rapid decline 
the company s isdn revenue declined to million in from million in in response to increased customer demand for real time collaboration products  the company has shifted its focus away from traditional isdn based products in order to develop and sell its ip based products 
evolving markets 
sales of real time collaboration products account for an increasing portion of the company s revenue 
the company s success depends  to a significant extent  on the acceptance and the rate of adoption of collaboration products  in general and its products in particular 
there is inadequate experience to predict whether real time collaboration products will ultimately be accepted by the market 
there can be no assurance that any of the markets for the company s products will develop to the extent  in the manner  or at the rate anticipated by the company 
in addition  future prices the company is able to obtain for its products may decrease from historical levels as a result of new product introductions by others  price competition  technological change or other factors 
rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  emerging network architectures and frequent new product introductions 
the adoption rate of new technologies and products may adversely impact near term growth of the conferencing market as users evaluate the alternatives 
the company has invested  and for plans to continue to invest  in software development and products incorporating certain of these new technologies 
many other companies  including the company s largest customer  are also developing products incorporating these new technologies that are competitive with the company s current and future offerings 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability through continued investments to maintain technological leadership  to enhance and expand its existing product offerings and to select and develop in a timely manner new products that achieve market acceptance 
competition 
the market for networking and communication products is highly competitive 
the company expects competition to increase significantly in the future 
a number of companies have introduced or announced their intention to introduce products that could be competitive with the company s products  and the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which the company competes may attract other new entrants as they perceive opportunities 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources 
infoworkspace acquisition 
on december   the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the operating assets and intellectual property of the infoworkspace tm  a business unit of general dynamics electronic systems 
the company entered into the purchase agreement with the expectation that the transaction will result in certain benefits including  among other things  benefits relating to expanded and complementary product offerings  enhanced revenues  increased market opportunity  new technology and the addition of engineering personnel 
achieving the benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the integration of our technology  operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner so as to minimize the risk that the transaction will result in the loss of market opportunity or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management 
in particular  the management team and developers who work with the infoworkspace business unit are located in colorado springs  colorado  mountain view  california  washington  dc  and its principal offices are located in burlington  massachusetts 
the company cannot assure you that it will successfully integrate the infoworkspace tm operations and personnel with its operations and personnel 
in addition  the company cannot assure you that  following the transaction  its businesses will achieve revenues  specific net income or loss levels  efficiencies or synergies that justify the acquisition or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings in any future period 
infoworkspace tm products provide knowledge workers a secure virtual workspace for project and team collaboration 
infoworkspace tm is currently used primarily by government organizations  including defense department agencies and the intelligence community 
period to period fluctuations 
the company s operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of several factors  including the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company  its major customers and its competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product mix of revenue  changes in the relative proportions of revenue among distribution channels or among customers within each distribution channel  changes in manufacturing costs  price reductions for the company s products  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  seasonally  and general economic conditions 
new customers orders have generally been characterized by lengthy sales cycles  making it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
the company typically operates with a small backlog 
as a result  quarterly revenue and operating results generally depend on the volume  timing of and ability to fulfill orders received within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
also  changes in ordering patterns have resulted in the company recognizing a substantial portion of its revenue in a given quarter from sales booked and shipped in the last weeks of that quarter 
all of the above factors can materially adversely affect the company s business and operating results for one quarter or a series of quarters  and are difficult to forecast 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based  in large part  on its expected future sales 
as a result  if revenues fall below expectations  there would likely be a material adverse effect on the company s operating results because only a small portion of the company s expenses vary with its sales in the short term 
protection of proprietary technology 
the company s success depends  to a large extent  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company currently holds eight us patents relating to its existing products and has several patent applications pending 
in addition to its patents  the company relies primarily on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets and copyrights to protect its intellectual property rights 
retention of key employees 
the company s success depends  to a significant degree  upon the continuing contributions of its key management  sales  marketing and research and development personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
the company does not have employment contracts with most of its key personnel 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain such key employees 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company has cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  a decrease of million from december  the company regularly invests excess funds in short term money market funds  government securities and commercial paper 
the company has no long term debt 
on october   the company s board of directors approved a stock buy back program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to of its outstanding shares or approximately million shares at prevailing market prices from time to time 
during the quarter ended december   the company repurchased  shares at prevailing market prices  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
on december   the company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the operating assets and intellectual property of the infoworkspace  a business unit of general dynamics electronic system  for million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
an advance of million was paid in december  and the balance is due in installments through january the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
item a

the company invests cash in highly liquid investments  consisting of highly rated us and state government securities  commercial paper and short term money market funds
