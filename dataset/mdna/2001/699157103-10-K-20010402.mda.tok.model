item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis are intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
basis of presentation we account for our interest in first permian using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  we record our investment in first permian at cost on the balance sheet 
this is increased or reduced by our proportionate share of first permian s income or loss  which is presented as one amount in the statement of income 
our share of first permian s oil and gas reserves is presented separately under our oil and gas reserve information in note to the financial statements 
at december   we had recorded a loss of  in our investment in first permian 
our loss is recorded as a net liability in our investment to the extent that we had guaranteed  of the debt of first permian 
effective october   we were released from this guarantee and  although we continue to utilize the equity method of accounting  our financial statements no longer include first permian s losses because we are released from our guarantee 
to the extent first permian generates income in excess of losses  we will then recognize our share of the net income on our financial statements 
general our primary objectives are to build oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings per share by exploring for new oil and gas reserves  acquiring oil and gas properties and optimizing production from existing oil and gas properties 
management seeks to achieve these objectives by using advanced technologies to conduct exploratory activities  acquiring producing properties we believe add incremental value to our asset base  keeping debt levels low  concentrating activities in core areas to achieve economies of scale  and emphasizing cost controls 
since  our primary focus has been exploratory drilling using d seismic technology 
our long term business strategy is to increase our reserve base by using this and other advanced technologies 
additionally  we intend to exploit our existing properties and to acquire properties we believe can be exploited by developing reserves not previously produced 
we undertake projects only when we believe the project has the potential for initial cash flow adequate to return the project s capital expenditures within a short period of time  generally less than months 
we also endeavor to maximize the present value of our projects by accelerating production of our reserves consistent with prudent reservoir management and prevailing energy prices 
following this strategy  we have discovered oil and gas reserves using d seismic technology in the horseshoe atoll reef trend of west texas and the yegua frio wilcox gas trend onshore the gulf coast of texas 
additionally  we have acquired producing oil and gas properties in the permian basin of west texas 
capital used to acquire these properties has been provided primarily by secured bank financing  sales of our equity securities and cash flows from operations 
operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
gas prices we receive are influenced by seasonal demand  weather  hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  availability of pipeline transportation to end users  proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and to a lesser extent  world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include production expenses  overhead requirements  and costs of capital 
our oil and gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included cash flow from operations  sales of our equity securities  and bank borrowings 
our oil and gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas properties and the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
see note to the financial statements 
these costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  costs of drilling both productive and non productive wells  and overhead expenses directly related to land acquisition and exploration and development activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless such disposition involves a material change in reserves  in which case the gain or loss is recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including estimated future development costs  is provided using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and production  which are converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
unproved oil and gas properties are not amortized  but are individually assessed for impairment 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and gas properties being depleted 
depletion per equivalent unit of production ebo was versus in and in the decrease per boe in was a result of a decrease of  in the net oil and gas properties depletable base coupled with a disproportionate decrease in total beginning of the year reserves of  boes 
results of operations our business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in our reserve base  sources of production  product mix oil versus gas volumes  and the prices we receive for our oil and gas production 
year to year or other periodic comparisons of the results of our operations can be difficult and may not fully and accurately describe our condition

years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
parallel s total oil and gas revenues for were  an increase of  or approximately  from  for the increase in revenues for when compared with is related to a increase in production volumes and an increase in the average price per ebo we received for our oil and gas sales 
production 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production volumes in totaled  ebos compared with  ebos in the increase in production was primarily due to increased drilling activity in  which resulted in more wells being placed in production 
production costs 
the rise in production costs for  when compared with  was primarily the result of increased production taxes associated with increased revenues and  to a lesser degree  a slight increase in production volumes 
production costs increased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   from  for the same period of production costs as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily because of higher oil and gas prices  which resulted in higher revenues 
average production costs per ebo increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to in the same period of  primarily because of increased production taxes 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  in the increase was primarily related to increases in automobile and salary expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period in this decrease is primarily a result of higher oil and gas prices  which increased revenues 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
dd a expenses for increased  to  versus  in this increase was primarily the result of a increase in production volumes 
dd a expense as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily because of higher oil and gas revenues 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
during  we did not recognize any impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a noncash impairment charge of  related to our oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of oil and gas assets in was primarily the result of a decrease in our year end proved reserves 
under full cost accounting rules  each quarter we are required to perform a ceiling test calculation 
the full cost pool carrying values cannot exceed a company s future net revenues from its proved reserves  discounted at per annum using constant current product prices  and the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
the ceiling test was computed using the net present value of reserves at december  based on prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas 
the prices used to compute the ceiling test in were per bbl and per mcf 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  compared with  for the same period of this decrease was principally a result of lower average borrowings from our revolving line of credit facility and an increase in interest income 
income tax benefit expense 
for the year ended december   we recognized tax expense of  for the year ended december   we did not recognize an income tax benefit or expense 
our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in you should read note to the financial statements on page f  included in
