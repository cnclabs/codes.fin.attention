item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company owns and operates full service  casual dining restaurants 
as of december   the company operated restaurants 
in addition  the company operates three limited menu take out service units 
on october   the company  acquired pursuant to a tender offer  approximately of the outstanding common stock of rainforest cafe  a publicly traded restaurant company 
on december   the company completed the merger with rainforest cafe 
the aggregate purchase price for all outstanding shares was approximately million 
as of february   there where domestic rainforest cafes owned and operated by the company and international franchised units 
the company owns an equity interest in certain international franchised units 
subsequent to the acquisition  four rainforest cafe restaurants have been closed 
it is probable that certain additional rainforest cafe restaurants failing to meet certain minimum standards will be closed 
excluding anticipated unit closures  the acquired rainforest cafe restaurants incurred an same store sales decline for the two months ended december   as compared to the same period in the prior year 
revenues for substantially all rainforest cafe restaurants have experienced same store sales declines for an extended period of time 
correspondingly  restaurant profitability has also declined 
management plans to address the sales declines through improved menu development  a focused general manager incentive plan similar to that implemented in the company s other restaurants in  investment in improved ambiance  additional marketing initiatives and selective unit closures of restaurants that do not meet the company s minimum standards 
there is no assurance that management will successfully curtail the same store sales decline of rainforest cafe restaurants or that its operational and financial plans will improve operating margins  particularly in situations where sales declines continue 
based on the company s historical experience  initial operating results for the rainforest cafe s units will be adversely affected by the new menu rollout 
cost of sales will be subject to inefficiencies during the learning process and labor expenses will be impacted by additional training and staffing costs 
further inefficiencies may occur as the company implements its financial  management and operational systems in these restaurants 
the company s operations may be impacted by changes in federal and state taxes and other federal and state governmental policies which include many possible factors such as the level of minimum wages  the deductibility of business and entertainment expenses  levels of disposable income and national and regional economic growth 
there are various federal  state and local governmental initiatives to increase the level of minimum wages which would increase the company s labor costs 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive and is affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants 
the company has many well established competitors with greater financial resources and longer histories of operation than the company  including competitors already established in regions where the company is planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
the company faces significant competition from mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
the company s competitors include national  regional  and local chains as well as local owner operated restaurants 
the company also competes with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites
