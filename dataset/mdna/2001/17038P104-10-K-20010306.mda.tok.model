item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an integrated communications provider offering voice and broadband data telecommunications services primarily to small and medium sized businesses in second and third tier markets in the northeastern and midwestern united states 
our services include local exchange service  long distance service  high speed data and internet service principally utilizing dsl technology  and web page design  development and hosting services 
we seek to become the leading integrated communications provider in each of our markets by offering a single source of competitively priced  high quality  customized telecommunications services 
a key element of our strategy is to be one of the first integrated communications providers to provide comprehensive network coverage in each of the markets we serve 
we are achieving this market coverage by installing both voice and data equipment in multiple established telephone company central offices 
we have connected the majority of our clients directly to our own switches  which allows us to more efficiently route traffic  ensure quality service and control costs 
on august   we acquired us xchange  inc  a facilities based competitive local exchange carrier with operations in the midwestern united states 
through our acquisition of us xchange  we have accelerated our entry into midwestern markets and created a service area that now extends from wisconsin to massachusetts 
we have integrated us xchange s operations and infrastructure with ours and enhanced their product offerings to match those provided in our northeastern markets 
included in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are adjusted ebitda amounts 
adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash deferred compensation and non cash management allocation charges 
adjusted ebitda is used by management and certain investors as an indicator of a company s historical ability to service debt 
management believes that an increase in adjusted ebitda is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
however  adjusted ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows  nor has it been presented as an alternative to either operating income  as determined by generally accepted accounting principles  nor as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as determined by generally accepted accounting principles  and is thus susceptible to varying calculations 
adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we had negative adjusted ebitda of million  million  and million for the years ended december  and and the period from inception june  to december   respectively 
we expect that our adjusted ebitda will continue to be negative while we emphasize development  construction and expansion of our telecommunications services business and until we establish a sufficient revenue generating client base 
factors affecting results of operations revenue we generate revenue from the following categories of service o local calling services  which consist of monthly recurring charges for basic service  usage charges for local calls and service charges for features such as call waiting and call forwarding  o long distance services  which include a full range of retail long distance services  including traditional switched and dedicated long distance  calling  international  calling card and operator services  o dsl and other data services  which consist primarily of monthly recurring charges for connections from the end user to our facilities  o access charges  which we earn by connecting our clients to their selected long distance carrier for outbound calls or by delivering inbound long distance traffic to our local service clients  o reciprocal compensation  which entitles us to bill the established telephone companies and competitive local exchange carriers for calls in the same local calling area placed by their clients to our clients  and o web design and web hosting 
the market for local and long distance services is well established and we expect to achieve revenue growth principally from taking market share away from other service providers 
although we anticipate that access charges will decline on a unit basis  we expect our aggregate revenue from access charges that are based on long distance calls made by and to our clients to grow as we are able to increase our client base 
the market for high speed data communications services and internet access is rapidly growing and intensely competitive 
while many of our competitors enjoy advantages over us  we are pursuing a significant market that  we believe  is currently underserved 
see business market opportunity 
we price our services competitively in relation to those of the established telephone companies and offer combined service discounts designed to give clients incentives to buy a portfolio of our services 
during the past several years  market prices for many telecommunications services on a unit basis have been declining  which is a trend that we believe will likely continue 
this decline will have a negative effect on our revenue that may not be offset completely by savings from decreases in our cost of services 
as prices decline for any service  we believe that the total number of users and their usage will increase 
although pricing will be an important part of our strategy  we believe that direct relationships with our clients and consistent  high quality service and client support will be essential to generating client loyalty 
see business competition 
our experience demonstrates that there is significant churn of clients within the telecommunications industry  and we believe that churn is especially high when clients are only buying long distance services from a carrier or when clients are buying resold services 
the former us xchange initially resold established telephone company services to establish a market presence and enhance its market penetration efforts 
we have reduced our emphasis on resale services and intend to transition most us xchange resale clients to our switch based network 
we seek to minimize churn by providing superior client care  by offering a competitively priced portfolio of local  long distance and internet services  and by focusing on offering our own facilities based services 
there is uncertainty surrounding the payment of reciprocal compensation by the established telephone companies for calls delivered to internet service providers due to pending regulatory proceedings 
however  the amount of reciprocal compensation revenue that we receive related to internet service providers is not material 
see regulation federal regulation 
network costs our network costs include the following o the cost of leasing high capacity digital lines that interconnect our network with established telephone company networks 
these facilities are also used to connect our switching equipment to our transmission equipment located in established telephone company central offices  as well as to connect our transmission equipment between these offices 
these network expenses include non recurring installation costs and monthly recurring fixed costs 
as new markets are entered  these fixed costs are a major component of our total network costs 
as markets mature  these costs remain a significant part of our ongoing cost of services  but at a declining percentage of total costs 
we are planning to deploy fiber in many of our markets  which will replace the leased network facilities and decrease our leasing costs 
in our markets in wisconsin  michigan  indiana and illinois we already have operational intra city fiber in place and  as a result  our leasing costs in these markets are significantly less than in the markets where fiber has not been deployed 
we plan to deploy fiber in many of our other markets beginning in o the cost of leasing local loop lines which connect our clients to our network 
the costs to lease local loop lines from established telephone companies vary by company and are regulated by state authorities under the telecommunications act 
these client loop costs are for voice and data lines as well as client t links 
these expenses include non recurring installation costs and monthly recurring fixed costs 
as our clients and related lines continue to increase  total local loop line costs will continue to increase and will remain an increasingly significant component of our ongoing network costs 
o the cost of leasing space in established telephone company central offices for collocating our transmission equipment 
in constructing switching and transmission equipment for a new market  we capitalize  as a component of property and equipment  non recurring charges for items such as construction 
we also capitalize the monthly recurring costs of the collocations during the construction period  typically one to two months 
these capitalized non recurring costs are depreciated over the life of the lease and are not included in our network costs 
recurring costs  after traffic is being carried  are expensed as incurred and are included in our network costs 
as a market matures  these costs should remain relatively constant  decreasing as a total component of total network costs 
o the cost of completing local calls originated by our clients 
these local call costs are referred to as reciprocal compensation costs and are incurred in connection with both voice and data services 
we must enter into an interconnection agreement with the established telephone company to make widespread calling available to our clients when we enter a market 
these agreements typically set the cost per minute to be charged by each party for the calls that are exchanged between the two carriers networks and provide that a carrier must compensate another carrier when a local call by the first carrier s client terminates on the other carrier s network 
these reciprocal compensation costs will grow as our clients outbound calling volume grows and will continue to be a significant component of total network costs 
as clients and related lines installed increase  our costs will continue to increase proportionately 
o the cost of completing  originating calling and terminating inbound calling long distance calls by our clients 
the cost of securing long distance service capacity is a variable cost that increases in direct relationship to increases in our client base and our clients long distance calling volumes 
these minute of usage charges will continue to be a significant component of total network costs 
as clients and related lines installed increase  these costs will continue to increase proportionately 
o the cost of leasing our inter city network 
our inter city network facilities are used to carry data traffic between our markets and for delivery to internet access points 
the costs of these lines will increase as we increase capacity to address client demand  open new markets and connect additional markets to our internet network 
as we deploy fiber  however  the costs associated with the leased facilities will decrease 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with sales and marketing  client care  billing  corporate administration  personnel and network maintenance 
we expect to incur significant selling and marketing costs as we continue to expand our operations 
we also plan to offer sales promotions to win clients  especially during the next several years as we continue to establish our market presence 
because our business strategy stresses the importance of personalized client care  we expect our client care department to become a larger part of our ongoing administrative expenses 
we also expect billing costs to increase as our number of clients and call volume increase 
bill processing costs are expected to be a significant part of our ongoing administrative expenses 
we will incur other costs and expenses  including network maintenance costs  administrative overhead  office lease expense and bad debt expense 
we expect that these costs and expenses will grow significantly as we expand our operations and that administrative overhead will be a large portion of these costs and expenses during the first few years of our operations 
however  we expect these costs and expenses to become a smaller percentage of our revenue as we build our client base 
deferred compensation as the estimated fair market value of our common stock exceeded the exercise price of certain options granted  we recognized deferred compensation which is amortized over the vesting period of the options 
as our estimated fair market value has exceeded the price at which shares of our stock have been sold to management employees since our formation  we have recognized a deferred compensation charge of million which is being amortized over a four year period from the date the shares were issued 
in addition  we have similarly recognized a deferred compensation charge of million in connection with the issuance of options to various employees  which is being amortized over a four year period from the date the options were issued 
management ownership allocation charge upon consummation of our initial public offering  we were required by generally accepted accounting principles to record the million increase in the assets of choice one communications llc allocated to management as an increase in additional paid in capital  with a corresponding increase in deferred compensation 
we were required to record million of the deferred compensation as a non cash  non recurring charge to operating expense during the period in which the initial public offering was consummated  and the remaining million was recorded as deferred management ownership allocation charge 
we amortized million of the deferred charge during and will amortize million and million during and  respectively  base on the period over which we have the right to repurchase the securities 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of switch related equipment  non recurring charges and equipment collocated in established telephone company central offices  network infrastructure equipment  information systems  furniture  fixtures and indefeasible rights to use fiber 
it also includes amortization of goodwill  client base and deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility 
our acquisitions of us xchange  atlantic connections and edgenet have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired goodwill for us xchange  atlantic connections and edgenet was million  million and million  respectively  and is being amortized over year periods 
the value of the client bases acquired from us xchange  atlantic connections and edgenet is million  million and million  respectively  and is being amortized over five year periods 
the value of the indefeasible right to use fiber acquired from us xchange is million and is being amortized over years 
we expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we continue to make capital expenditures and acquire long term rights in telecommunications facilities 
interest income expense our interest income includes income generated from our cash and other short term investments 
we expect interest income to gradually decline as we use our surplus cash to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
our interest expense includes interest payments on borrowings under our senior credit and subordinated debt facilities  amortization of deferred financing costs related to these facilities and unused commitment fees on the senior credit facility 
we expect interest expense to increase over the next several quarters  once our surplus cash is depleted and as our borrowings increase to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
income taxes we have not generated any taxable income to date and do not expect to generate taxable income in the next few years 
the use of our net operating loss carryforwards  which begin to expire in  may be subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  due to the uncertainty of its realizability 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  revenue we generated million in revenue for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we increased  or obtained through the incremental gain from the acquisition of us xchange  the lines in service by  lines during the year ended december   compared to  lines in service during the year ended december  at december   we had a total in service base of  lines  which compares to  lines in service as of december  sales are expected to increase from the level realized during the year ended december  as new markets are opened and as existing markets are further developed 
network costs network costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to network costs of million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the deployment of our networks and growth of our services in markets with collocation sites as compared to nine markets with collocation sites as of december  we achieved positive gross margin revenue less direct network costs of million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to a negative gross margin of million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  these increased expenses resulted primarily from the recording of a million non cash management allocation charge as a result of our initial public offering and from the acquisition of us xchange and the related growth in employees 
revenue growth has exceeded the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   while selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the non cash management allocation charge and amortization of non cash deferred compensation  grew during the same period 
excluding the non cash management ownership allocation charge and amortization of deferred compensation  selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our number of employees increased to  as of december   from as of december  as of december   there were sales employees  including direct sales  sales support and sales management 
this compares to as of december  we expect the number of sales employees and total employees to increase as we expand in our existing markets and as we enter new markets 
management ownership allocation charge and deferred compensation for the year ended december   we recognized non cash management ownership allocation charges of million 
we also recognized million and million of non cash deferred compensation amortization for the year ended december  and  respectively 
deferred compensation was recorded in connection with membership units of choice one communications llc sold to certain management employees and grants to employees under our stock option plan 
in august  deferred compensation of million was recorded to stockholders equity in connection with the issuance of restricted shares to the employees of us xchange 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase results from higher capital expenditures from the deployment of our networks and initiation of services in new markets and the acquisition of us xchange 
approximately half of the depreciation and amortization was generated from the intangibles as a result of our acquisitions  the most significant being the august acquisition of us xchange 
goodwill from the acquisitions of us xchange  atlantic connections and edgenet was million  million and million  respectively 
client base acquired through the acquisitions of us xchange  atlantic connections and edgenet was million  million and million  respectively 
the value assigned to the indefeasible right to use fiber received in connection with the acquisition of us xchange was million 
we expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we continue to make capital expenditures and acquire long term rights in telecommunications facilities 
net loss the net loss applicable to common stock for the year ended december  was million 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million 
adjusted ebitda was negative million for the year ended december   compared to negative million for the year ended december  interest income expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
interest expense includes interest payments on borrowings under our senior credit and subordinated debt facilities  amortization of deferred financing costs related to such facilities and unused commitment fees on the senior credit facility 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million

interest income results from the investment of cash and cash equivalents  mainly from the cash proceeds generated from the borrowings under our senior credit and subordinated debt facilities 
interest income for the year ended december  was  income taxes we have not generated any taxable income to date and do not expect to generate taxable income in the next few years 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  due to the uncertainty of its realizability 
results of operations for the year ended december  and the period from june  date of inception to december  during the period from our inception on june  through december   we were in the development stage of operations and did not generate any revenue

during the period from our inception on june  through december   we incurred a net loss of million  which was attributable to selling  general and administrative expenses of million  including noncash deferred compensation of 
million  and minimal depreciation and amortization expense 
we became operational in nine markets by the end of and generated million in revenue for the year ended december  for the year ended december   after giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of atlantic connections and the incurrence of debt in connection therewith  we would have had a net loss of million 
our historical network operating costs  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense during this period were million  million  and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash and million in short term investments 
in addition  we had million available under the revolving credit facility

the senior credit facility  which is secured by liens on substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets and a pledge of our subsidiaries common stock  contains covenants and events of default that are customary for credit facilities of this nature 
we also have million outstanding under our subordinated debt facility 
cash flows 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to experience increasing operating losses and negative ebitda as we expand our operations and build our client base 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to net losses and an increase in current liabilities due to market expansion and central office collocations added during the year

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was related to million of borrowings under the credit facility  million of equity contributions and million of payments of financing costs 
capital requirements 
capital expenditures were million and million from the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that our capital expenditures will be less in future periods as we become operational in all of our planned markets 
net cash used in our investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  was due to capital expenditures for new and existing markets during it was also due to the acquisitions of us xchange in august and edgenet in february for net cash consideration of million and million  respectively 
net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  was due to capital expenditures 
to expand and develop our business  we will need a significant amount of cash 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimates as a result of the demand for our services and regulatory  technological and competitive developments  including additional market developments and new opportunities in the industry and other factors 
we may require additional financing  or require financing sooner than anticipated  if our development plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate 
we may also require additional financing in order to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  to effect acquisitions of businesses  to develop new services or to otherwise respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures 
sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings  vendor financing or the private or public sale of equity or debt securities 
our ability to obtain additional financing is uncertain 
we believe that our cash resources and available credit facilities are sufficient to meet our future capital and operating requirements for our market plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the carrying value of our debt obligations excluding capital lease obligations was million and the fair value of those obligations was million 
the weighted average interest rate of our debt obligations at december  was 
a hypothetical decrease of approximately from prevailing interest rates at december   would result in an increase in the fair value of our long term debt by approximately million 
also  a hypothetical increase of approximately from prevailing interest rates at december   would result in an approximate increase in cash required for interest on our variable rate debt during the next five fiscal years of million per year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and  subject to limitations and conditions  are required by our credit facility 
under the credit facility agreement  we are required to enter into hedging agreements with respect to interest rate exposure with an aggregate notional amount equal to of the outstanding borrowings once at least of the aggregate commitment has been utilized 
by their nature  these interest rate swap agreements involve risk  including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties  and our maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet 
we attempt to control our exposure to counterparty credit risk through monitoring procedures and by entering into multiple contracts 
at december   we had an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of million 
based on the fair value of the interest rate swap at december   it would have cost us million to terminate the agreement 
a hypothetical decrease in the rate would decrease the fair value by approximately million
