the discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k

these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed or implied in such forward looking statements cautionary statements 
the risks and uncertainties and their impact on the partnership s operations include  but are not limited to  the following risks o the impact of weather conditions on the demand for propane  o fluctuations in the unit cost of propane  o the ability of the partnership to compete with other suppliers of propane and other energy sources  o the ability of the partnership to retain customers  o the impact of energy efficiency and technology advances on the demand for propane  o the ability of management to continue to control expenses  o the impact of regulatory developments on the partnership s business  o the impact of legal proceedings on the partnership s business  o the partnership s ability to implement its expansion strategy into new lines of business and to integrate acquired businesses successfully 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the partnership or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such cautionary statements 
product costs the retail propane business is a margin based business where the level of profitability is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of propane is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions 
propane unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact retail margins 
there is no assurance that the partnership will be able to pass on product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
during fiscal and  the average cost of propane to the partnership was substantially higher than in prior years 
through increases in retail sales prices  the partnership was able to pass on product cost increases during fiscal and seasonality the retail propane distribution business is seasonal because of propane s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
to the extent necessary  the partnership will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many customers of the partnership rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  the volume of propane sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather which can vary substantially from year to year 
risk management the partnership engages in risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on its product costs and to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
the partnership is currently a party to propane futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange and enters into forward and option agreements to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
these activities are monitored by management through enforcement of the partnership s commodity trading policy 
risk management transactions do not always result in increased product margins 
see additional discussion in item a of this report 
selected quarterly financial data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and second quarter revenues and earnings are consistently greater than the comparable third and fourth quarter results

adoption of new accounting standard effective with the first quarter of fiscal  the partnership adopted sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas requires entities to record derivatives as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet based on their fair value with any subsequent changes in the fair values of contracts recorded in income  unless the contracts qualify as hedges 
certain contracts qualifying for hedge accounting would have changes in fair values reported as a component of comprehensive income equity 
based on the criteria set forth in sfas  management determined that the partnership s derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and  commencing with the adoption of sfas  its derivatives are marked to market through income 
the fair market value of the partnership s derivative portfolio on the date of adoption of sfas did not reflect any unrealized net gain or loss and accordingly  no cumulative effect of this change in accounting is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  all business combinations initiated after june  are required to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   but early adoption is permitted for companies with a fiscal year beginning after march  the partnership has elected to early adopt sfas effective for the first quarter of fiscal the partnership estimates that adoption of the standard will result in a decrease in goodwill amortization expense for fiscal of million 
in addition  the partnership believes that the required transitional impairment review will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the partnership is currently in the process of evaluating the impact sfas will have on the consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the partnership 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   the partnership was party to propane forward and option contracts with various third parties and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
forward and future contracts provide that the partnership sell or acquire propane at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require its holder to buy or sell propane at a specified price during a specified time period  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of propane to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price of propane and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into in anticipation of market movements and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating propane prices as well as to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of high demand 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with the partnership s trading policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
market risk the partnership is subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures contracts traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
credit risk futures contracts are guaranteed by the nymex and as a result have minimal credit risk 
the partnership is subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
the partnership evaluates the financial condition of each counterparty with which it conducts business and establishes credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate the partnership s exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane related to its open inventory positions  the partnership developed a model which incorporated the following data and assumptions a 
the actual fixed price contract settlement amounts were utilized for each of the future periods 
b 
the estimated future market prices were derived from the nymex for traded propane futures for each of the future periods as of september  c 
the market prices determined in b above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a above to project the additional loss in earnings which would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicate potential losses in future earnings of million and million  as of september  and september   respectively 
the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
as of september   the partnership s open position portfolio reflected a net long position purchase aggregating million 
as of november   the posted price of propane at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was cents per gallon as compared to cents per gallon at september   representing a decline 
this decline is attributable to factors including warmer weather patterns  high national propane inventory levels and decreases in the market price of crude oil
