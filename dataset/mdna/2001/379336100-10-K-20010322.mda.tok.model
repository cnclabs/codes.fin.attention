global conveyed to oceaneering its rovs and related equipment in asia and australia and its rov triton xl in the gulf of mexico 
in exchange  oceaneering conveyed to global the dive support vessel ocean winsertor along with air and saturation diving equipment in asia  australia  china  and the middle east 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues

in addition  included in the results for the year ended december   beginning in the third quarter  are the consolidated financial results of global s ownership of ccc s offshore construction operations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results also reflect the company s ability to win jobs through competitive bidding and manage awarded jobs to successful completion 
the level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by three factors first  the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production  second  the oil and gas industry s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and third  weather events such as major hurricanes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  declined to million from million for the year ended december  the decline in revenues is primarily attributable to decreased activity in the company s west africa  latin america  and asia pacific divisions 
these amounts were partially offset by increases in the company s gulf of mexico diving  gulf of mexico marine support  and middle east segments 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for both the year ended december  and december  gross profit for the year ended december  was million as compared with million for the year ended december  the decline was largely the result of decreased international activity  partially offset by higher gross profit from the company s gulf of mexico diving  gulf of mexico marine support  and middle east segments 
the higher gross profits in these areas was due primarily to increased activity and increased rates 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was due primarily to an entire year of consolidation of the company s mexican operations in fiscal as compared to a half year in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization  including amortization of dry docking costs  was million compared to the for the year ended december  the decline was principally attributable to decreased utilization of the company s pipelay derrick barges  in the west africa  latin america  asia pacific and gulf of mexico offshore construction divisions  which are depreciated on a units of production basis 
this decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation expense associated with the company s carlyss facility  which was operational for a full year in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher average outstanding debt levels  higher effective interest rates  and less capitalized interest 
net income loss 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  included in the net loss for the year ended december  is a million loss associated with the company s previous ownership interest in ccc 
the company s effective tax rate for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate relates primarily to changes in taxable income in differing taxable jurisdictions and a tax benefit in on the capital loss related to the sale of global s interest in ccc 
segment information 
the company has identified seven reportable segments as required by sfas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of those reportable segments 
gulf of mexico offshore construction revenues declined to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  from million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  income before taxes decreased to a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to income before income taxes of million for the comparable period last year 
the decreases in revenues and earnings were due primarily to decreased demand for offshore construction services in the gulf of mexico and resulting pricing pressures 
gulf of mexico diving revenues from diving related services in the gulf of mexico increased due to increased demand from external customers and more contract specific work in the gulf of mexico offshore construction segment 
gross revenues increased to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  the increased activity levels and slight rate increases caused income before taxes to increase to million during the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  gulf of mexico marine support due to increased activity and pricing  revenues for this segment increased to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december   from million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  as a result of the overall increase in activity levels and improved pricing  income before taxes also increased to million during the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  west africa due to decreased activity levels  revenues decreased to million  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in revenues is due primarily to the completion of two large contracts in  one of which had a large level of subcontracted fabrication and procurement content 
as a result activity level decline  earnings before taxes decreased to a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  latin america decreased activity levels resulted in a decrease in revenues to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  earnings before taxes were also affected by the activity level decline as earnings decreased to a nominal profit from million for the year ended december   net of million of equity in ccc losses 
asia pacific revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for year ended december  this reduction was due primarily to reduced activity and the completion of one large pipelay contract in the year ended december  loss before taxes increased to a million loss as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the decline in profits was attributable to the ending of the aforementioned project  reduced demand  increased pricing pressures  costs associated with the establishment of the bangkok regional office  costs associated with the oceaneering transaction  and certain market entry pricing 
middle east revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  loss before taxes decreased to a loss of million during the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues and earnings is primarily attributable to increased activity levels 
year ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  of million were lower than revenues for the twelve months ended december  of million 
the decrease in revenues resulted largely from decreased domestic and middle east division activities and downward pricing pressure 
these amounts were partially offset by increases in the company s latin america and asia pacific divisions 
the latin america division s revenues increased substantially due to the cessation of global s ownership interest in ccc and subsequent acquisition of ccc s offshore construction operations  as discussed previously 
increases in asia pacific are primarily due to a large pipeline contract  which occurred  in fiscal gross profit 
for the year ended december   the company had gross profit of million compared with million for the twelve months ended december  the decline was largely the result of decreased domestic activity and margin erosion  partially offset by higher gross profit from the latin america division 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december   was compared to the gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended december  of 
lower margins in the gulf of mexico  combined with the lower margins for work in asia pacific and middle east  principally accounted for the decline 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general  and administrative expenses of million were higher than the million reported during the twelve months ended december  the increase was attributable to increased labor costs and other related expenses associated with the relocation of the company s corporate offices to carlyss louisiana and the consolidation of ccc s offshore construction operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of dry docking costs  for the year ended december  was million compared to the million recorded in the twelve months ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increased employment of the upgraded hercules in the gulf of mexico  which is depreciated on a units of production basis 
lower employment of other vessels that are also depreciated on a units of production basis partially offset the increase 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest  for the year ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  primarily due to higher average debt levels outstanding and higher effective interest rates 
net income loss 
earnings for the year ended december  declined to a million loss as compared to million of net income recorded for the twelve months ended december  included in the net loss for the year ended december  is a million loss associated with the company s previous ownership interest in ccc 
the loss associated with the ccc ownership for the twelve months ended december  was million 
also included in the net loss for fiscal are nonrecurring charges of million  related to cost associated with the terminated etpm acquisition and the replacement of the company s credit facility 
the company s effective tax rate for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to for the twelve months ended december   reflecting changes in taxable income in differing taxable jurisdictions and the resolution of prior year tax matters 
segment information 
the company has identified seven reportable segments as required by sfas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of those reportable segments 
gulf of mexico offshore construction overall decreased demand for offshore construction services in the gulf of mexico and resulting pricing decreases caused this segment s gross revenues to decline to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december  compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the twelve months ended december  the lower activity levels and associated pricing decreases also caused income before taxes to decline to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  gulf of mexico diving revenues and income before taxes from diving related services in the gulf of mexico declined due to decreased demand from both external customers and the gulf of mexico offshore construction segment 
gross revenues for the year ended december  declined to million including million intersegment revenues compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the twelve months ended december  the overall lower activity levels and pricing pressure caused earnings before taxes to decline to a loss of million during the year ended december  compared to income of million for the twelve months ended december  gulf of mexico marine support decreased demand and resulting pricing pressures also affected the gulf of mexico marine support services 
gross revenues from gulf of mexico marine support services declined to million including million intersegment revenues for the year ended december   compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the twelve months ended december  earnings before taxes also declined to a loss of million during the year ended december  compared to income of million for the twelve months ended december  west africa during  revenues from the west africa construction market remained relatively stable 
for the year ended december   gross revenues decreased to million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  earnings before taxes decreased to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  earnings reductions were primarily due to lower margins on one large contract 
latin america revenues increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  earnings before taxes increased to million during the year ended december   net of million of equity in ccc losses  compared to a loss of million for the twelve months ended december  as previously discussed  effective july  global acquired ownership of ccc s offshore construction operations and divested itself of a ownership in ccc s entire operation 
asia pacific for the year ended december   gross revenues increased to million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  earnings before taxes decreased to a loss of million during the year ended december  compared to income of million for the twelve months ended december  revenues increased due primarily to the one large pipeline contract  which started in march earnings reductions were primarily a result of new area startup costs and poor initial productivity 
middle east decreased demand and eroding margins dramatically affected this division 
gross revenues declined to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  earnings before taxes also declined to a loss of million during the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the twelve months ended december  nine months ended december  compared to nine months ended december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report revenues 
revenues for the nine months ended december  of million were higher than revenues for the nine months ended december  of million 
the increase in revenues resulted largely from increased international activity and the company s expansion in those areas  through acquisitions 
acquisitions that contributed to increased international revenues included i certain business operations and assets of sub sea international  inc in the gulf of mexico  asia pacific  and the middle east in july  ii the construction barge seminole acquired in june  and iii the construction barges dlb and dlb acquired in april the west africa region produced greater revenues during the nine months ended december  compared to the same period a year earlier as offshore construction projects resumed after a cycle of low construction activity in the earlier period 
the overall increase in revenues was partially offset by decreased revenues from operations in the gulf of mexico 
gross profit 
for the nine months ended december   the company had gross profit of million compared with million for the nine months ended december  the increase was largely the result of increased west africa and asia pacific activity  and was partially offset by lower gross profit from the gulf of mexico 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended december   was compared to the gross profit percentage earned for the nine months ended december  of 
lower margins in the gulf of mexico  combined with the lower margins for work in asia pacific and middle east  contributed to the decline 
margins as a percent of revenue in west africa for the nine months ended december   were higher than the nine months ended december  cost of revenues for the nine months ended december  includes an accrual of million for retirement and incentive compensation expense 
the company did not record a provision for retirement and incentive compensation during the nine months ended december  selling  general  and administrative expenses 
for the nine months ended december   selling  general  and administrative expenses of million were higher than the million reported during the nine months ended december  the increase was attributable to the expansion of the company s business and accrued severance costs and was partially offset by salary reductions effected in october as a percentage of revenues these expenses remained at approximately 
during the nine months ended december   the company provided for million of retirement and incentive compensation plan expenses with million included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company did not record a provision for retirement and incentive compensation during the nine months ended december  because it does not anticipate making such payments to employees for services during that period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of dry docking costs  for the nine months ended december  was million compared to the million recorded in the nine months ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increased employment of the upgraded hercules in the gulf of mexico and employment of the seminole  dlb  and dlb in asia pacific  each of which are depreciated on a units of production basis 
a full nine months of depreciation on assets acquired from subsea in july and higher amounts of dry dock amortization also contributed to the increase 
lower employment of other vessels that are also depreciated on a units of production basis partially offset the increase 
effective april   the company changed its estimate of the useful lives of certain marine barges that are depreciated on the units of production method 
the company increased total estimated operating days for such barges to better reflect the estimated periods during which the assets will remain in service 
for the nine months ended december   the change had the effect of reducing depreciation expense by million and increasing net income by million per basic and diluted share 
interest expense 
interest expense was million net of capitalized interest for the nine months ended december   compared to million for the nine months ended december  principally due to higher average long term debt outstanding 
net income 
net income for the nine months ended december  declined to million as compared to million recorded for the nine months ended december  included in net income for the nine months ended december  is a million loss associated with the company s ownership interest in ccc 
the loss associated with the ccc ownership for the nine months ended december  was million 
increased operating losses  currency exchange rate losses  and an adjustment to prior years taxes contributed in the increase in ccc s losses 
the company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended december  was  compared to for the nine months ended december   reflecting changes in taxable income in differing taxable jurisdictions 
segment information 
the company has identified seven reportable segments as required by sfas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of those reportable segments 
gulf of mexico offshore construction overall decreased demand for offshore construction services in the gulf of mexico and resulting pricing decreases caused this segment s gross revenues to decline to million including million intersegment revenues for the nine months ended december  compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the nine months ended december  the lower activity levels also caused income before taxes to decline to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  the hercules returned to service in july  and helped partially offset the decline 
gulf of mexico diving revenues and income before taxes from diving related services in the gulf of mexico declined due to decreased demand from the gulf of mexico offshore construction segment 
gross revenues for the nine months ended december  declined to million including million intersegment revenues compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the same period ended december  revenues from external customers increased by million  but were partially offset by pricing decreases 
the overall lower activity levels caused income before taxes to decline to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  gulf of mexico marine support decreased demand and resulting pricing decreases also affected the gulf of mexico marine support services 
gross revenues from gulf of mexico marine support services declined to million including million intersegment revenues for the nine months ended december   compared to million including million intersegment revenues for the same period ended december  income before taxes also declined to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  west africa during  the west africa construction market recovered from a down cycle in for the nine months ended december   gross revenues increased to million compared to million for the nine months ended december  income before taxes increased to million during the nine months ended december  compared to a million loss for the nine months ended december  for the first time since entering the west africa market  the company employed two barges simultaneously during the nine months ended december  latin america for the nine months ended december   revenue from services and equipment provided to ccc increased to million compared to million for the nine months ended december  the increase was attributable to ccc s increase in offshore construction activity 
income before taxes and equity in ccc losses increased to million during the nine months ended december  compared to million for the nine months ended december  however  the increased income was offset by equity in ccc losses of million and million  respectively 
the increase in ccc s loss was largely the result of increased operating losses  currency exchange rate losses  and an adjustment to prior years taxes 
asia pacific asia pacific construction results benefited from the acquisition and placement of construction barges in that region 
for the nine months ended december   gross revenues increased to million compared to million for the nine months ended december  income before taxes increased to million during the nine months ended december  compared to a million loss for the nine months ended december  in april  the company acquired the dlb and dlb in that region 
each of the acquired barges were employed under a short term bare boat charter agreement with hydro marine services  inc  an affiliate of j 
ray mcdermott sa  to allow for completion of certain contractual commitments 
the dlb completed its commitment in august  and the dlb completed its commitment in october in september  the seminole began working in asia pacific after the company relocated it from the middle east 
middle east global entered into the middle east construction market with the july  acquisition of sub sea international  inc s middle east operations and assets 
revenues were million for the nine months ended december  compared to the five month revenues of million included in the nine months ended december  losses before taxes during the nine months ended december  increased to million compared to a million loss included in the nine months ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash balance decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   the company s operations generated cash flow of million 
cash from operations and the reduction in the company s cash balance funded investing activities of million and financing activities of million 
investing activities consisted principally of capital expenditures and dry docking costs 
funds used by financing activities principally represent repayment of balances under the company s credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks 
working capital decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in working capital is due to decreases in cash and escrow funds and increases in current maturities of long term debt  accrued interest  and other accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures during the year ended december  aggregated million for the conversion and upgrade of the hercules  the upgrade of the pioneer  the purchase of a new foot class liftboat and additional support structures related to the carlyss  louisiana deepwater support facility and pipebase 
the company estimates that the cost to complete capital expenditure projects in progress at december   will be approximately million all of which is expected to be incurred during the year ending december  in august  the board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to purchase shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
the board of directors placed no limit on the duration of the program 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares since the authorization at a total cost of million 
during fiscal and no shares were purchased 
under the company s credit facility  discussed below  stock purchases are prohibited 
long term debt outstanding at december   including current maturities  includes million of title xi bonds including those from february described below  million of lake charles harbor and terminal district bonds  million of heller financial debt  and million drawn against the company s term facility 
the company maintains a million credit facility  which consists of a million term loan facility and a million revolving loan facility 
both the term and revolving loan facility mature on december  the term and revolving loan agreement permit both prime rate bank borrowings and london interbank offered rate libor borrowings plus a floating spread 
the spread for both prime rate and libor borrowings will float up or down based on the company s performance as determined by a leverage ratio 
the spreads can range from to and to for prime rate and libor based borrowings  respectively 
in addition  the facility allows for certain fixed rate interest options on amounts outstanding 
both the term and revolving loan facility mature on december  and are subject to certain financial covenants 
stock of the company s subsidiaries  certain real estate  and the majority of the company s vessels collateralize the loans under the credit facility 
in september  the company amended its credit facility to mitigate certain financial covenants for the quarter ended september  and the next three quarters 
at december   the company was in compliance with the amended credit facility  however  two financial covenants are near their limits and the company s current expectations of its operations may result in one or more of such covenants not being met at the end of the second quarter 
if such covenants cannot be met  the company expects to seek waivers from its lenders 
as of march   the company had million of credit capacity under it credit facility 
in february  the company completed title xi mortgage financing for million  at per annum  for the conversion of the hercules 
these bonds financed both phase i and phase ii of the hercules conversion 
phase i proceeds  net of fees  amounts to million and was used to pay down term debt under the company s credit facility

these bonds mature in and require semi annual payments of million  plus interest 
the company s other title xi bonds mature in    and the bonds carry interest rates of   and per annum  respectively  and require aggregate semi annual payments of million  plus interest 
the agreements pursuant to which the title xi bonds were issued contain certain covenants  including the maintenance of minimum working capital and net worth requirements 
if not met  additional covenants result that restrict the operations of the company and its ability to pay cash dividends 
the company is currently in compliance with these covenants

the aggregate of these guarantees and bonds outstanding at december  was million 
the company expects funds available under the credit facilities  available cash  and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to fund the company s operations  scheduled debt retirement  and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
industry outlook the company is optimistic about the future as the number of working offshore rigs has been increasing and commodity prices have been strong 
capital expenditures for offshore development of new and existing fields are expected to increase 
prospects for the offshore construction industry are increasing due to projected demand for oil and gas  coupled with the depletion of existing petroleum reserves 
based on the increase in bidding activity that the company is currently experiencing  the company is expecting an increase in worldwide offshore construction activity levels in the second half of in addition  as the company has historically done  it will continue to evaluate the merits and opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of equipment or businesses 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas was subsequently amended by sfas in june and sfas in september sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires  among other things  that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company will adopt the accounting standard effective for its fiscal year beginning january   as required 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
in  the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements  which effectively modified the interest characteristics of million of its outstanding long term debt 
the agreements involve the exchange of a variable interest rate of libor plus for amounts based on fixed interest rates of between to plus 
these swaps have maturities between twelve to thirty six months 
these transactions were entered into in the normal course of business primarily to hedge rising interest rates 
the estimated fair market value of the interest rate swap based on quoted market prices was million as of december  a hypothetical basis point decrease in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of this instrument 
interest on approximately million  or of the company s long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of at december   was variable  based on short term market rates 
thus  a general increase of in short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of million per year if the company were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
also  the company has approximately million fixed interest rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately and a market value of approximately million on december  a general increase of in overall market interest rates would result in a decline in market value of the debt to approximately million 
the company uses natural hedging techniques to hedge against foreign currency exchange losses by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
the company also  to the extent possible  maintains cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
the company does not believe that a change in currency rates in the regions that it operates would have a significant effect on its results of operations
