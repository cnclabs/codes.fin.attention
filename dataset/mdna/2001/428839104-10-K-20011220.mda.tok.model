item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents introduction until the mid s hickok was known primarily for its ability to develop and manufacture high technology  precision indicating instruments for business and pleasure aircraft  locomotive and general industrial applications 
this reputation was enhanced because of the company s capabilities in the design and implementation of electronics circuitry 
in recent years the company has applied this expertise toward the development of electronic diagnostic equipment used in the automotive industry 
the company s first major diagnostic tool was introduced in the early s and sold direct to ford motor company 
that tool  and all the other diagnostic tools sold by the company  are now distributed through various aftermarket channels 
the company currently generates approximately of its revenue from designing and manufacturing diagnostic tools for the automotive aftermarket 
these tools enable automotive service technicians to identify problems in the rapidly increasing number of electronics systems in automobiles 
approximately eight years ago the company initiated a strategy to use existing expertise to diversify its customer base and add new products within its various product classes 
the strategy has been implemented using acquisitions and modifying the organization to a market orientation 
in february  the company increased its automotive aftermarket business with the acquisition of waekon industries  a privately owned company in kirkwood  pennsylvania 
sales of aftermarket products now account for of automotive diagnostic and specialty tool sales  in fiscal waekon manufactures a variety of automotive diagnostic equipment and specialty tools used by automotive technicians 
the acquisition cost  and was recorded as an asset purchase 
because of its positive position in the industry  the waekon name has become the trademark used by the company to market its products to the automotive aftermarket 
in july  the company closed down its production and sales facility in kirkwood  pennsylvania pursuant to a restructuring plan 
the expected annual cost savings of approximately  anticipated in the closing of the kirkwood  pennsylvania facility took into consideration possible increases in other expenses that might occur 
the savings were expected to be realized in equal amounts per month with similar impact on both future earnings and cash flow  beginning in october major expense categories anticipated to be affected are as follows applicable to manufacturing rent  utilities  insurance production overhead wages product development marketing and administration annual total for the year ended september  the company achieved the savings that were anticipated 
in april of management took steps to reduce non direct product related expenses throughout the company by an estimated 
the steps included a substantial reduction in personnel and expenditure restrictions in most aspects of the company s operations 
the savings of approximately  in fiscal  anticipated at the time of the reductions  were realized 
the timing of order releases in the company s automotive diagnostic equipment business can cause wide fluctuations in the company s operating results  particularly on a quarter to quarter basis 
orders for such equipment can be large  are subject to customer release  and may result in substantial variations in quarterly sales and earnings 
there were no large orders of this nature in either of the past two fiscal years 
the primary reason for this was the company s efforts in recent years to diversify its customer base 
however  in future years the introduction of new products could result in a significant increase in order levels which may result in substantial variations in quarterly sales and earnings 
any foreign sales are made in united states dollars 
short term earnings also can be affected by levels of expenditures for product development 
introduction of new automotive diagnostic products to the aftermarket on a regular basis is very important for the ongoing success of this business segment 
consequently  expenditures for product development have been and will continue to be significant to the company s operations 
the company s order backlog as of september  totaled  as compared to  as of september  and  as of september  the decrease in fiscal is due to lower orders for indicators and gauges of  completion of the balance of a large diagnostic product order  reduced orders for automotive diagnostic products of  and fastening control products of  most of the backlog at september  is expected to be shipped by the end of the current fiscal year 
the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in orders for indicators and gauges and fastening control products 
reportable segment information effective september   the company adopted financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the standard requires segment information disclosures based on how management evaluates operating performance and resource allocations 
the company has determined that it has two reportable segments indicators and gauges and automotive related diagnostic tools and equipment 
indicators and gauges this segment consists of products manufactured and sold primarily to companies in the aircraft and locomotive industry 
within the aircraft market  the primary customers are those companies that manufacture business and pleasure aircraft 
within the locomotive market  indictors and gauges are sold to both original equipment manufacturers and to operators of railroad equipment 
automotive diagnostic tools and equipment this segment consists primarily of products designed and manufactured to support the servicing of automotive electronic systems 
these products are sold both direct and to the aftermarket using a variety of distribution methods 
the acquisition of waekon industries in added new products and distribution sources for the aftermarket 
included in this segment are fastening control products used primarily by a large automobile manufacturer to monitor and control the nut running process in an assembly plant 
this equipment provides high quality threading applications 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended september  declined to  a decrease of approximately from fiscal sales of  this decrease in sales was volume driven and attributable primarily to lower product sales of approximately  the decline in product sales was partially offset by and increase in service revenue of approximately  the reduction in product sales occurred in the automotive diagnostic equipment segment  primarily sales to oem accounts as the company continues to emphasize its aftermarket business 
aftermarket sales were flat in fiscal for several reasons 
sales of emissions products were negatively impacted as several states continued to delay implementation of gas cap and gas tank testing 
the company anticipates that overall product sales will remain at current levels in fiscal the current level of service revenue is expected to continue for fiscal sales for the fiscal year ended september  declined slightly to  a decrease of approximately from fiscal sales 
this decrease in sales was primarily volume driven and attributable to lower product sales of approximately  service revenue was essentially flat compared to fiscal the reduction in product sales occurred in the automotive diagnostic equipment segment 
sales of automotive diagnostic products to oem accounts decreased by  while sales of fastening systems products dropped by  cost of products sold in fiscal was  or of net product sales compared to  or of net product sales respectively in fiscal cost of products sold during fiscal was  or of net product sales 
the increase in the percentage of cost of products sold applicable to product sales between fiscal and fiscal was due to a change in product mix as sales of lower margin automotive diagnostic products to the aftermarket and other markets represented a larger portion of total product sales offset in part by expense reductions implemented in april the decrease in the percentage of cost of products sold between fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to product mix and to operating efficiencies realized at the manufacturing level 
the cost of products sold percentage should decrease slightly in fiscal due to a change in product mix and a full year of expense reductions implemented in april cost of services sold in fiscal was  or of net service sales compared to  or respectively in fiscal cost of services sold during fiscal was  or of net service sales 
the decrease in the cost of services sold as a percentage of net service sales is due to a higher sales volume coupled with a favorable product mix and expense reduction measures implemented in april offset in part by a slight increase in warranty related costs associated with the automotive diagnostic products 
the increase in the cost of services sold as a percentage of net service sales between fiscal and fiscal is primarily due to a change in product mix and a slight increase in warranty repair charges 
the percentage of cost of services sold relative to net service sales is expected to improve slightly in fiscal product development expenditures in fiscal were  which was lower than expenditures of  in fiscal the dollar decrease is due primarily to cost savings from the closing of the kirkwood  pennsylvania facility and to expense reduction measures implemented in april product development expenditures in fiscal were  which was lower than expenditures of  in fiscal this decrease reflects efficiencies resulting from technology improvements in engineering systems and procedures 
it is anticipated that the amount spent on product development in fiscal will be approximately lower than the amount spent in fiscal due to a full year of expense reductions implemented in april while continuing to support the ongoing need to develop a steady flow of new diagnostic products for the automotive aftermarket 
marketing and administrative expenses amounted to  which was of net sales in fiscal   or of net sales in fiscal  and  or of net sales in fiscal expenditures in fiscal were lower than fiscal due to lower marketing and administrative expenses as a result of expense reduction measures implemented in april and to a lesser extent to expenses applicable to the closing of the kirkwood  pennsylvania facility in july expenditures in fiscal were higher than fiscal due to an increase in commissions and royalties associated with certain aftermarket product sales 
the company anticipates that marketing and administrative expenses will decrease in fiscal due to a full year of expense reductions implemented in april interest charges were  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in interest charges in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a reduction in short term borrowings 
the decrease in interest charges in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a reduction in long term debt incurred with the waekon acquisition in february  in fiscal  a restructuring charge of  was recorded due to the closing in july  of the company s manufacturing facility in kirkwood  pennsylvania 
these charges were composed of  of future lease payments   of losses on the abandonment of the plant facility and equipment and  of employee severance and related expenses 
the company expected to realize pre tax operating cost savings of approximately  annually as the facility in greenwood  mississippi has taken over all manufacturing formerly performed in kirkwood 
for the fiscal year ended september  the company achieved the savings anticipated

it is anticipated that the effective tax rate in fiscal will approach the rate experienced in fiscal due to the anticipated existence of research and development tax credits 
management anticipates that with an improved economy  an increase in sales combined with operating efficiencies due in part to the restructuring of the kirkwood  pennsylvania operation and cost saving measures recently implemented will generate sufficient taxable income during the carryforward period to fully realize the deferred tax benefits

the change in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to lower sales offset in part by the cost saving measure of the kirkwood  pennsylvania plant closing in july and the expense reduction measures implemented in april the change in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to a restructuring charge of  which represented a one time charge associated with the decision to close the company s manufacturing facility in kirkwood  pennsylvania 
the facility was closed on july  as a cost saving measure and production was transferred to the company s greenwood  mississippi facility 
liquidity and capital resources current assets of  at september  were times current liabilities and the total of cash and receivables was times current liabilities 
these ratios compare to and respectively at the end of fiscal total current assets were down approximately  from the previous year end due primarily to a reduction in inventory of approximately  the decrease in inventory was due to a significant order completed during the period and a management emphasis on inventory reductions throughout product categories 
working capital at september  was  as compared to  a year ago 
the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in inventory of approximately  a reduction in current deferred income taxes and refundable income taxes totaling approximately  offset by an increase in cash of  and a reduction of short term borrowing of  during the fiscal year the company s business may require an increase in inventory of work in process and finished goods in order to meet anticipated delivery schedules 
whenever there may be a requirement to increase inventory in fiscal there will be a negative but temporary impact on liquidity 
the company believes that internally generated funds and a  revolving line of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing working capital requirements 
internally generated funds in fiscal were  and were adequate to fund the company s primary non operating cash requirements consisting of capital expenditures of  and debt payments of  the primary reason for the positive cash flow from operations was the reduction in inventory 
in fiscal internally generated funds were  and were not adequate to fund the company s primary non operating cash requirements consisting of capital expenditures and long term debt payments of  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the negative cash flow in fiscal was the net loss of  and a  reduction in accounts payable 
in fiscal internally generated funds were a negative  and were not adequate to fund the company s prime non operating cash requirement consisting of capital expenditures and long term debt payments of  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the negative cash flow from operations was a  increase in accounts receivable 
the company expects internally generated funds in fiscal from operating activities  primarily net income  to be adequate to fund approximately  of capital expenditures and  due on the current portion of long term debt 
most of the capital expenditures will be made to upgrade engineering and manufacturing equipment 
in february  the company amended an existing credit agreement with its financial lender 
the agreement expires in february  and provides for a secured revolving credit facility of  with interest at the prime commercial rate with a libor option 
at september   the company had no outstanding balance under this loan facility 
effective april  the agreement was secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and general intangibles 
also in april  the credit agreement was amended to reduce the working capital covenant from  to  until december  at which time it reverts back to  management believes it can obtain a waiver if the covenant is violated in the future 
in addition  management has determined a revolving credit facility is important to the company and is currently in negotiation with its financial lender regarding renewal of the facility 
the company is confident a facility can be negotiated at acceptable terms 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has had a minimal effect on the company because of low rates of inflation and the company s policy prohibiting the acceptance of long term fixed rate contracts without provisions permitting adjustment for inflation
