we license our software through our direct sales force  telesales  international distributors  business partners  and resellers 
software revenue increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily the result of the expansion of our sales and marketing force during the first two quarters of in addition  we are shifting our sales focus away from sales to dot com companies towards sales to large enterprise opportunities with multinational companies 
international product sales accounted for and of segue s total product sales in and  respectively 
the increased international sales were primarily attributed to the expansion of the european sales force and increased demand for testing products 
total ebusiness software revenue represented and of total software revenue in and  respectively 
segue client server products represented and of the total software revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
it became apparent in that our continuing focus on the ebusiness testing market and the enhanced silk family of products has almost completely replaced our original core product line 
the rate of continued software revenue growth depends upon our ability to successfully generate and fulfill current software license orders  generate incremental revenue from our business partnerships and strategic alliances  attract and retain skilled personnel and deliver timely new products and enhancements and continued market growth 
performance could also be affected by the market acceptance of our silk family product enhancements and new product areas 
services revenue services revenue consists of revenue from maintenance  training and consulting 
services revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in services revenue is a result of the growth in our installed customer base and the increased training and consulting services performed for those customers 
maintenance revenue increased to million in compared to million in training and consulting revenue increased to million in compared to million in the moderate increase in training and consulting revenue was primarily due to the increase in product revenue  which drove up the demand for consulting services and training 
the increase in recognized maintenance revenue was driven largely by incremental additional software licenses sold over the past months 
recognized maintenance revenue is being amortized over the contract period  which is predominately a month period 
in addition  as the installed base of license holders has increased  revenue from the renewal of maintenance contracts has also increased 
cost of software cost of software includes documentation  product packaging  product media  employment costs for processing and distribution  amortization of capitalized technology and royalties due to third parties 
these costs decreased to million  or of software revenue  in compared to million  or of software revenue  in the amortization of the completed technology included in cost of software for and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of software is mainly the result of our continuing cost control effort through scrutinization of expenditures  and a reduction in royalty expenses 
in december  we entered into a five year agreement with a software vendor  which provides future royalty payments to the vendor of of net revenues achieved on sales of segue products to the vendor s customer base 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid a guaranteed  non refundable minimum royalty of  in december as of december   other current assets included approximately  and other long term assets included approximately  related to the guaranteed royalties 
during  we expensed approximately  of this prepaid royalty 
in december  we determined that future sales from this vendor were uncertain and wrote off the remaining prepaid balance of approximately  cost of services cost of services consists principally of salaries and benefits for our customer technical support staff  which provides services under maintenance contracts  and for our training and consulting staff  as well as third party consulting fees and the cost of materials and facilities used in training customers 
cost of services decreased to million  or of services revenue  in compared to million  or of services revenue  in the decrease in cost of services is primarily due to the expansion of our consulting division by hiring more in house consultants rather than using third party consultants to assist in testing solution implementations 
the cost of third party consultants is generally higher than the cost of internal resources  thus  we spent less in as compared to additionally  our investment in northern ireland technical support center has proven to be successful 
we currently provide all technical support services through our global technical support center in belfast  northern ireland 
the number of the support staff in belfast has grown from to over the past year 
while the overall cost of technical support increased in due to increased staff and operating costs in belfast  the cost would have been higher if the same level of hiring had occurred in the us sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  travel costs and promotional marketing programs 
marketing programs include advertising  direct mail programs  seminars and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in expenses in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million  reflecting growth in sales and marketing headcount from to  an increase in spending on marketing programs of million and increase in facilities and related costs for sales and marketing of  segue expects sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as total revenue increases  but such expenses may vary as a percentage of revenue 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and facility costs 
to date  all of segue s internal costs for research and development have been charged to operations as incurred since amounts of software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
research and development expenses decreased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in during  as part of the management cost saving strategy  we shifted part of the research workforce from our californian lab to our austrian lab 
although the net headcount increased by  we managed to decrease the overall operating expenses because of the lower wage rates and overhead in austria 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for executive  finance  information technology  human resource and administrative personnel  professional fees  system support costs and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in included in the general and administrative expenses is  related to segue s portion of the settlement of certain lawsuits 
these settlements were approximately  for the shareholder lawsuits   for the complaint brought by charles white  julia miller and the charles white and julia miller trust  and  for other matters 
segue s insurance carriers will pay the balance of the lawsuits settlements 
the balance of the increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses is partly attributable to increased headcount and related compensation  increased consulting  legal and accounting expenses 
amortization of goodwill goodwill resulted from segue s acquisition of sqlbench in december and is being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
in  amortization expenses remained the same as in at million  which represented of total revenue in  as compared to in non recurring and other charges in  there were no non recurring and other charges 
during the second quarter of  we restructured our product development operations and delayed the introduction of the eventus product  silkcontrol 
these activities were aimed at reducing our costs associated with the development of that product and enhancing our sales force s ability to focus on other products 
the restructuring resulted in the consolidation of four development labs into three and included the termination of fifteen employees associated with the development of the eventus product 
additionally  during the second quarter of we shifted our sales strategy away from creating and managing a large network of resellers towards building deeper relationships with a few large system integrators 
this revised strategy resulted in the termination of seven employees who had focused sales efforts on these channel resellers 
we also terminated the employment of two senior vice presidents during the second quarter of  each of whom has been replaced 
associated with all the events noted above  segue recorded during the second quarter of non recurring and other charges of approximately million  of which million related exclusively to severance and other employee related costs associated with restructuring  and  including a noncash compensation charge of approximately  which related to severance of the two senior vice presidents 
as of december   we had made payments of approximately  related to the restructuring costs 
during the first half of  we paid the remaining restructuring balance of approximately  during the first quarter of  we executed a restructuring plan to consolidate our marketing  product development and administrative operations in order to achieve cost efficiencies through the elimination of redundant functions 
we realigned our marketing and product development operations to redirect our focus on our strongest product lines and better integrate the efforts of our product development teams 
as a result  segue recognized a non recurring charge of approximately million during the first quarter of this restructuring charge included approximately  for severance and other employee related costs for the termination of ten employees and approximately  for facility related costs  including the accrual of estimated lease obligations associated with the closure of excess office facilities 
as of december   we had made payments of approximately  related to these costs  and the related restructuring accrual balance was approximately  we paid off the  restructuring cost balance during the first half of at the time of the restructuring action  we expected to realize a reduction in recurring costs of approximately million annually as a result of the restructuring action 
however  there can be no assurance that such benefits will be realized 
other income expense interest income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is related to the decrease in the average amount of invested funds 
interest expense amounted to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased because of a lower balance outstanding on notes payable in as compared to provision for income taxes segue recorded a provision for foreign and state income taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no tax benefit for losses generated in the us during and due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits 
management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence impacting the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been fully reserved 
management re evaluates the positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  software revenue software revenue increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily the result of increased sales force productivity  resulting in increased unit shipments and greater market penetration into the ebusiness marketplace 
these increased unit shipments were due to continued demand for segue products from existing customers and due to first time buyers  the introduction of new and upgraded products  and increased market acceptance of the families of products including web application testing and load testing products 
international product sales accounted for and of total segue s product sales in and  respectively 
the slightly decreased international sales were primarily due to the shifting of sales strategy from distributor to direct sales 
total ebusiness software revenue represented and of total software revenue in and  respectively 
segue client server products  our historical core product line  represented and of the total software revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in ebusiness software revenue from year to year was due to our increased focus on the e commerce testing market and the introduction of our new and enhanced silk family products such as silkmonitor  silkobserver and silkpilot 
the rate of continued software revenue growth depends upon our ability to successfully generate and fill current software license orders  attract and retain skilled personnel and deliver timely new products and enhancements 
performance could also be affected by the market acceptance of our new products silkpilot  silkmeter and silkobserver 
services revenue services revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service revenue is a result of the growth in our installed customer base and the increased training and consulting services performed for those customers 
maintenance revenue increased to million in compared to million in training and consulting revenue increased to million in compared to million in the moderate increase in training and consulting revenue is primarily due to fact that we completed more year related projects during as compared to the increase in recognized maintenance revenue was driven largely by incremental additional software licenses sold over the past months 
cost of software cost of software decreased to million  or of software revenue  in compared to million  or of software revenue  in the amortization of the completed technology included in cost of software for and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of software is partly due to the non recurring charge of  to write off of an nre non recurring engineering fee and prepaid royalties 
there were no similar charges in in addition  cost of software is lower in as a result of segue s continuing effort to increase sales of non royalty bearing products and eliminate sales of royalty bearing products 
in december  we entered into a five year agreement with a vendor which provides for future royalty payments to the vendor of of net revenues achieved on sales of segue products to the vendor s customer base 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid a guaranteed  non refundable minimum royalty of  in december as of december   other current assets included approximately  and other long term assets included approximately  related to the guaranteed royalties 
future royalty expense will be recognized as cost of software based upon qualified sales of the segue s products 
to the extent that revenue from related products does not support the guaranteed royalties described above  we could be required to accelerate amortization of these prepaid royalties 
the amortization of the prepaid royalties may cause the cost of software to increase as a percentage of revenue in the future 
cost of services cost of services increased to million  or of services revenue  in compared to million  or of services revenue  in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to our utilization of third party consultants to assist in testing solution implementations 
the cost of third party consultants is generally higher than the cost of internal resources 
the increases in amount and as a percentage of service revenue are also the result of start up costs incurred in the first six months of associated with the staffing and training for our northern ireland technical support center  which began operations in july  as well as the operating expenses of this support center during headcount in the training and consulting and technical support groups increased from december  to december  we expect to continue to hire employees in the services group in order to generate and support worldwide services revenue and to provide ongoing quality customer support to our increasing installed base of customers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the principal reasons for the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses were increased headcount  increases in commissions as a result of higher revenue levels  higher commission rates used in commission plans and increases in related travel costs 
segue expects to continue the growth of its worldwide sales and marketing organization during the continued growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and sales personnel 
there can be no assurance that related increased expenditures would result in increased revenue or improvement in the effectiveness of our sales organization 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses is mainly attributable to the increased headcount 
segue intends to continue to make significant investments in research and development to develop new products and to expand the capabilities of its web application testing products 
during  segue introduced several new products  including silkmonitor  which provides monitoring and reporting of web  application and database servers  silkpilot  a corba based distributed object testing product  and silkobserver which provides object monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for ebusiness applications 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of total revenue  in compared to million  or of total revenue  in the increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses is partly attributable to increased headcount and related bonuses  increased facility costs for our new office location in lexington  massachusetts from august and increased consulting  legal and accounting expenses 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in to support our expanding business

however  there can be no assurance that these benefits will be realized 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to the eventus and black white acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this charge consisted primarily of investment banking  legal  accounting and other professional fees and related costs 
other income expense interest income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

management re evaluates the positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our operating activities utilized cash of million in  compared to million in cash utilized in primarily reflects net loss adjusted for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of goodwill and purchased research and development in connection with the sqlbench acquisition  as well as the change in accounts receivable as a result of our revenue growth and change in accounts payable  offset by increased accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
our investing activities generated cash of million in as compared to cash utilized of million in we purchased million of property and equipment in compared to million in the million  or  decrease in fixed assets expenditures as compared to was the result of the completion of a new management information system erp implemented in  as well as the infrastructure costs related to the opening of a technical support center in northern ireland during additionally  in we paid  on acquisition related notes payable 
the cash used in investing activities was largely offset by net maturities of short term investments 
our financing activities provided cash of  and million in and  respectively  primarily due to the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
during december  segue repurchased approximately  shares of its stock for approximately  our corporate headquarters in lexington  massachusetts is currently under a lease  which expires in october the annual rental rate is approximately million 
on july   we entered into an amendment to our sublease agreement to rent an additional  square feet within the headquarters location  with this additional space  we occupy a total of  square feet of office space at the headquarter location 
we have the right to terminate the lease on september  for a fee of approximately million 
during  we paid approximately  and  related to the first and second quarter restructuring charges  respectively 
we paid approximately  of the remaining balance related to the implementation of a new management information system 
in december  we paid approximately  for the final payment of the sqlbench notes issued in connection with the december acquisition of sqlbench 
in december  we settled  subject to final approvals  certain lawsuits  including the suit related to black white  and the securities litigation matter that is referenced in item of part ii of this form k and accrued segue s portion of the settlement  approximately  no amounts were paid on these lawsuits in as of february  we paid approximately  of these accruals see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we expanded our northern ireland technical support center during by adding seventeen technical support engineers 
in addition to the increased headcount  we also renovated the third floor of our belfast technical support center to accommodate the additional personnel 
the estimated total facility expansion costs were approximately  as of december   we had paid approximately  for leasehold improvement and approximately  for additional computer equipment located in northern ireland 
long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the development of new software products and enhancements of existing products  the enhanced presentation of our web site  the possible opening of additional international offices  and the possible acquisition of software products or technologies complementary to segue s business 
assuming there is no significant change in our business  we believe that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and debt requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event segue requires additional financing  we believe we would be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so  or that we could do so on terms favorable to segue 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
factors that may affect future results the company s prospects are subject to many uncertainties and risks 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities reform act of the company s future results may differ materially from its current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in segue s other filings with the sec 
our quarterly results may fluctuate 
segue s quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of its common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly for several reasons  including the timing and success of introductions of our new products or product enhancements or those of our competitors  uncertainty created by changes in the market  including in particular the dot com ebusiness market which may affect the ability of customers to order our products or to pay for them  difficulty in predicting the size and timing of individual orders  software bugs or other product quality problems  competition and pricing  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  increases in operating expenses  ability to increase sales from enterprise companies  and general economic conditions 
a substantial portion of segue s operating expenses are related to personnel  facilities and marketing and sales programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenue levels are below management s expectations for a certain quarter  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
furthermore  segue has often recognized a substantial portion of its product revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the latter part of that quarter and revenues from any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
segue typically does not experience order backlog 
for these reasons  segue believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we may not be profitable in the future 
since segue began operations  it has generally experienced losses 
losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  segue had net income of  in  a net loss of million in  which includes a charge of  for purchased research and development in process and  for severance charges  a net loss of million in  which includes a charge of million related to our acquisitions of eventus and black white  and a charge of  related to write offs of an nre fee and guaranteed royalties  a net loss of million in  which includes million for restructuring costs   for severance of senior executives  and a net loss of million for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we incurred  for various litigation settlement costs  which we charged to general and administrative expenses 
except for the third quarter of  the company has achieved sequential revenue growth in the past two years  but continued growth at the same rate may not be sustained  and is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
failure to achieve profitability may adversely affect the market price of segue s common stock 
segue may not be successful in generating substantial revenue from enterprise sales to larger more established companies 
historically  we have derived the overwhelming percentage of our product revenue from the sale of our products to dot com companies 
in the fourth quarter of those sales were negligible 
we reorganized our sales force in to target larger enterprise transactions with the more established companies 
three area vice presidents report directly to the chief executive officer and outside sales representatives now focus on these enterprise transactions 
in addition  a full time experienced general counsel was added to the senior staff to stream line the licensing process and close these bigger opportunities 
while we have experienced success in selling to this market  there is no assurance that segue can continue to close these transactions at a rate sufficient to generate substantial increases in revenue 
these larger transactions entail a greater closing risk since these are often complex and highly competitive  requiring more resources per transaction than with historically smaller clients 
the sales force must also adapt successfully to this type of selling 
if segue is unsuccessful in closing these larger deals  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
segue s new strategic alliance and partner programs may not be successful in increasing product revenues 
in an effort to augment the product revenue derived from the efforts of the direct sales force  we organized a strategic alliance group to develop successful business relationships with companies that have the ability to generate for us significant product revenue from the sale and use of our software products or the ability to deliver services in a hosted service environment 
traditionally  segue s revenue from strategic alliances has been modest and there is no assurance that these current efforts will be successful 
in parallel  with this focus on strategic alliances  we have adopted a new approach to our partner program and in particular a new partner revenue sharing model  which is designed both to increase product revenue as well as service revenue 
the strategic alliance and partner markets are highly competitive and uncertain 
should segue fail to generate substantial revenue from its strategic alliance and partner programs  the financial results and stock price could be adversely affected 
selling products and services through alliances and partnerships may limit our control and interaction with end users of our products 
as a result  our ability to forecast sales accurately  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be limited 
our ability to develop and maintain customer goodwill could also be affected 
finally  we will have to resolve potential conflicts among our sales force and business partners in order to make the partner program successful 
we may have difficulty managing organizational changes 
during the past year segue has reorganized its sales force  appointed new leaders in its support services  consulting  and product development areas  created a new strategic alliance group  appointed a new head of its channel partner program  and added a general counsel 
the success of these organizational changes is uncertain and further change could disrupt the operations 
we may be subject to risks associated with our past acquisitions and future acquisitions 
our product offerings and customer base has increased due in part to prior acquisitions 
we may do future acquisitions to enhance further our product lines 
our prior acquisitions or any future acquisition may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that we had anticipated  and an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as expected 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our existing business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
acquisitions may require significant financial resources that we might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
if segue pursues a future acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition 
to pay for a future acquisition  we might use capital stock or cash 
alternatively  we might borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use capital stock as we did with our past acquisitions  our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced 
segue faces significant competition from other software companies 
the market for web based software quality management and testing tools is new and evolving  intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
segue currently encounters competition from a number of public and private companies  including mercury interactive corporation  rational software corporation and compuware corporation 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do and  therefore  may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
such competition and any resulting reduction in profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
segue s business could be adversely affected if its products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs which result in product failures 
the occurrence of errors could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  significant repair and replacement costs  injury to our reputation  or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to technological and other market changes 
the nature of the web based automated software testing and ebusiness testing markets in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology  rapidly evolving customer needs and desires  changes in industry standards and practices and frequent releases of new product or enhancements by competitors 
to be competitive  segue must develop and introduce product enhancements and new products that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and potential customers 
failure to develop and introduce new products and enhancements successfully and on a timely basis  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
over ninety percent of segue s product revenue in was generated from its silkperformer and silktest products 
we must continue to grow sales of these products  and must also introduce new products and solutions  thereby reducing the risk of any undue reliance on current products for future revenues 
the development of technologies that result in new products or enhancements requires significant expenditures and utilization of resources 
we may not be successful in developing such technologies or may not be able to keep pace with technological developments 
if any of our newly developed products or product enhancements fail to be accepted by our existing and potential customers  our business may be materially adversely affected 
certain lawsuits have been filed against segue 
on or about april   a putative class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against segue  its chief executive officer and a former chief financial officer of segue  captioned nathan rice v 
segue software  inc  et al  civil no 
cv rgs 
the class action complaint alleged the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making material misrepresentations and omissions in certain public disclosures during the period beginning on october  through april   inclusive 
the public disclosures relate to  among other things  segue s past and future financial performance and results 
on or about may   another similar putative class action complaint was filed against segue  its chief executive officer and a former chief financial officer of segue in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  captioned anthony moumouris v 
segue software  inc  et al  civil no 
cv rgs 
these cases were consolidated under the caption in re segue software  inc 
securities litigation  civil no 
cv rgs and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on september  alleging a putative class period of july  through april   inclusive 
after the court granted segue s motion to dismiss and pending appeal of this order  segue and the plaintiffs agreed to settle this matter 
the settlement must be approved by the trial court 
after the contribution by insurance carrier  the settlement  if approved by the court  will not have a materially adverse effect on segue s financial results 
if the settlement is not approved by the trial court  there is a risk the plaintiffs will proceed with their appeal and succeed in obtaining a reversal of the district court s dismissal of this matter  which could expose segue to a claim for damages in an amount which the plaintiffs have not yet specified but which could  if successful  have a material adverse effect on segue s financial results see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
various other claims  charges and litigation have been asserted or commenced against segue arising from or related to contractual or employee relations 
management does not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of segue 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel in a tight labor market 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers and other senior personnel 
the failure to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel that are integral to our direct sales  product development  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face many risks associated with international business activities 
we derived approximately of total product software sales from international customers in the international market for software products is highly competitive and we expect to face substantial competition in this market from established and emerging companies 
we intend to expand our sales in asia and we may not be successful 
segue faces many risks associated with international business activities including currency fluctuations  imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
to the extent we are unable to continue to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
segue could be subject to product liability claims 
in selling its products  segue relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that contain  among other things  provisions protecting against the unauthorized use  copying and transfer of our software and limiting segue s exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  these licenses are not signed by the licensees and the provisions of these licenses  including the provisions limiting segue s exposure to liability claims  may therefore be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims 
segue s success depends on our ability to protect our software and other proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from segue s technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  these efforts may be inadequate 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
currently  we have three issued patents and a fourth pending 
there can be no assurance that these patents would be upheld if challenged 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
if we were to discover that any of segue products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms to continue licensing our software without substantial reengineering or that any effort to undertake such reengineering would be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause segue to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management resources from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or result in an injunction 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
segue is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through its investing and borrowing activities 
in addition  our ability to finance future acquisition transactions may be impacted if we are unable to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
our investing strategy to manage interest rate exposure is to invest in short term  highly secure and liquid investments 
we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in high grade corporate commercial paper 
as of december   the fair value of our short term investments approximated market value 
foreign currency risk 
segue faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge economic exposures or for trading 
historically  our primary exposures have been related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   the total impact of foreign currency changes was  the introduction of the euro as a common currency for most members of the european monetary union took place in our fiscal year of as of december   the impact of euro has not been significant to our business
