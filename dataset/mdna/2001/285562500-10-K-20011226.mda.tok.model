a majority of the company s bankcard processing expenses are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the transactions processed 
processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense and transaction expense  increased from  for fiscal year to  in  a increase

new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on its financial statements and the results of its operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires companies to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating the impact sfas will have on its financial statements and the results of its operations 
in august  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
this statement establishes a single accounting model for long lived asset impairment  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and resolves significant implementation issues related to sfas the company is currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on its financial statements and the results of its operations 
risk factors the company is subject to a number of risks  which could affect operating results and liquidity  including  among others  the following dependency on bank relationships 
the company currently relies on cooperative relationships with  and sponsorship by  banks in order to process its visa  mastercard and other bankcard transactions 
the company s banking relationships are currently with smaller banks with assets of less than 
even though smaller banks tend to be more unstable  these banks find the programs more attractive and the company believes that it cannot obtain similar relationships with larger banks at this time 
a bank could at any time curtail or place restrictions on the processing volume 
a bank might do this because of its internal business policies or due to other adverse circumstances 
if a volume restriction is placed on the company  it could materially adversely affect the business operations by restricting the company s ability to process credit card transactions and receive the related revenue 
the company s relationships with its customers and merchants would also be adversely affected by its inability to process these transactions 
to limit this problem  the company currently maintains relationships with two banks 
however  the company cannot assure that these banks will not restrict its processing volume or that the company will always be able to maintain its present banking relationships or establish new banking relationships 
even if new banking relationships are available  they may not be on terms acceptable to the company 
the company s failure to maintain these banking relationships and sponsorships would have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations 
business relationship with u haul international 
the business relationship with u haul is very important to the company 
in  of the equipment manufactured by the company was sold to u haul 
u haul accounted for approximately of echo s revenue in and of the revenue in there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the business relationship with u haul  or that sales to u haul will continue at the same levels as previous years 
any decrease could have a material adverse effect on echo 
bankcard fraud 
the company significantly relies on the processing of bankcard transactions 
if any merchants were to submit or process unauthorized or fraudulent bankcard transactions  depending on the dollar amount  echo could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations 
these types of losses are handled by the sponsoring banks as follows first regional bank echo assumes and is compensated for bearing the risk of these types of losses 
the berkshire bank echo assumes and is compensated for bearing the risk of these types of losses 
the company has implemented systems and software for the electronic surveillance and monitoring of fraudulent bankcard use 
the company cannot guarantee that these systems will prevent fraudulent transactions from being submitted and processed 
the company does not have insurance to protect it from these losses  but the company does allocate ten basis points 
of daily processing activity as a reserve against these types of losses 
there is no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to offset against any unauthorized or fraudulent processing losses that the company may incur 
depending on the size of such losses the company s results of operations could be immediately and materially adversely affected 
dependence on key employees 
echo s success has been and will continue to be dependent on the services of key technical and managerial personnel such as joel m 
barry  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
barry could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business 
the company believes that its success also depends on its ability to continue to be able to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled technical and management employees and consultants who are in great demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such employees and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 
risk of not remaining listed on nasdaq 
echo is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
there is no assurance that the listing of the company s common stock will  in the future  always continue to satisfy the nasdaq listing requirements 
if the company was delisted from nasdaq  this would have a material adverse effect on the price and the liquidity of the company s common stock 
competition 
echo is in the business of processing transactions and designing and implementing integrated systems for its customers so that they can better use echo s services 
this business is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  rapid rates of product obsolescence  and rapid rates of new products introduction 
the company s market share is relatively small as compared to most of its competitors and most of these competitors have substantially more financial and marketing resources to run their businesses 
this enables the company s competitors to better and more quickly respond to new and emerging technologies  changes in customers needs  and to devote more resources to product and services development and marketing 
the company may face increased competition in the future and there is no assurance that current or new competition will allow the company to keep its customers 
if the company loses customers  its business operations may be materially adversely affected  which could cause it to cease its business or curtail its business to a point where the company is no longer able to generate sufficient revenues to fund operations 
there is no assurance that the company s current products and services will stay competitive with those of the company s competitors or that the company will be able to introduce new products and services to compete successfully in the future 
rapid technology changes 
the company s business industry involves rapidly changing technology 
recently  the company has observed rapid changes in technology as evident by the internet and internet related services and applications  new and better software  and faster computers and modems 
as technology changes  echo s customers desire and expect better products and services 
the company s success depends on its ability to improve its existing products and services and to develop and market new products and services 
the costs and expenses associated with such an effort could be significant to the company 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to find the funds necessary to keep up with new technology or that if such funds are available that the company can successfully improve its existing products and services or successfully develop new products and services 
the company s failure to provide improved products and services to its customers or any delay in providing such products and services could cause it to lose customers to its competitors 
loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on echo 
dependence on technology and related patents 
the company currently owns three patents that relate to unique aspects of its products or services 
even though the company has these patents  there can be no assurance the company s competitors will not be able to develop a better product or a better way of providing the company s services to its current or potential new customers 
the company s patents have not been tested in the courts so the company is unable to determine if they will be sustained in the company s favor 
if echo s patents are not sustained in its favor  the company s competitors could determine its business methods and then develop and market competing products and services 
such an outcome could cause the company to lose customers  which could materially adversely affect its results of operations 
the company has expended considerable time and money in the development of ideas and seeking patent protection for them 
if the company seeks additional patents in the future  or if the company is required to prosecute or defend its patents  the expenses associated with such patent related activities could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
certain of the company s intellectual property is not protected 
the company has expended a considerable amount of time and money to develop information systems for its merchants 
the company has not obtained any intellectual property protection or other protection on these information systems 
the company also believes that these information systems do not infringe upon the rights of any third parties  however  there is no assurance that third parties will not bring infringement claims against the company 
the company also has the right to use certain technology of others through various license agreements 
if a third party claimed these licenses were infringing their technology  the company could face additional infringement claims and potential negative results 
the company is aware that a third party has claimed that the company s united states postal service money order distribution system violates their patents 
this third party has not taken any action with respect to their claim to date 
the company believes that it is not infringing their patents 
if an infringement claim is brought against the company and the company loses  it could be required to stop using that type of product  system or service as well as pay monetary damages to the person or entity making the claim 
this result could materially adversely affect results of operations and manner in which the company could do business 
if the company was not able to implement another method its business could fail 
if the company is required to continuously defend infringement claims  the costs and expenses associated with such a defense could be very expensive to the company and could materially adversely affect the results of operations 
delay in the company s growth strategies 
the company continues to enter into transactions  which may assist the company in its efforts to stay competitive 
some of the company s newer subsidiaries  such as xpresschex and rocky mountain retail systems  inc  started to work on additional check products  so that the company can deliver a more comprehensive suite of services to its customers 
although the company believes that its investment in these subsidiaries will ultimately increase earnings at this time some of their products are still in the development phase and there is no assurance as to when the new products will show profitability 
need for additional funds 
the company uses funds generated from operations to finance its operations 
the company currently believes that the cash flow from operations is sufficient to support its business activities  including research  development and marketing costs 
future growth will depend on the company s ability to raise additional funds  either through operations  bank borrowings  or equity or debt financings 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to raise the funds necessary to finance growth or continue to generate the funds necessary to finance operations  and even if such funds are available  that the terms will be acceptable 
the inability to generate the necessary funds from operations or from third parties could force the company to cut back its operations by limiting research  development and growth opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on echo 
underwriter market maker 
trading markets for echo s common stock were maintained on nasdaq by the underwriter who took the company public in its initial public offering in november and various other broker dealers who are members of the national association of securities dealers 
this underwriter  which had been the company s principal market maker  went out of business in june none of the remaining market makers are under any legal obligation to maintain a market in the company s common stock and may discontinue such activities at any time 
if these other market makers choose not to maintain a market in the company s common stock  such a discontinuance could have a material adverse effect on the price and liquidity of the company s common stock 
lack of insurance protection for the company s products and services 
the company does not have insurance protection against claims for product liability or errors and omissions for the products and services sold by the company 
if claims are brought by the company s customers or other third parties  the company could be required to pay the required claim or make significant expenditures to defend against such claims 
there is no assurance that the company will have the money to pay such claims if they arise 
if the company does have the money to pay the claims  such a payment could have a material adverse effect upon on the company 
risk of losses from real estate purchases 
the company currently holds several real estate properties 
the company s business activities no longer include the purchase or investment in real estate 
sale of the company s current real estate holdings could result in a loss to the company 
the company has provided a reserve account to reflect the estimated market value less disposition cost of its properties  but any difference could result in a loss 
the company does not maintain title insurance on its real estate holdings and could incur substantial losses from title defects 
depending on the size of any loss  such loss could have a materially adversely affected on the company 
cost of defending lawsuits 
the company is involved in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
although the company believes that the claims asserted in such lawsuits are without merit  the cost to the company for the fees and expenses to defend such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
in addition  although the company has not experienced any material liability relating to these claims to date  there can be no assurance that the company will not at some time in the future experience significant liability in connection with such claims see item legal proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is currently not exposed to any significant financial market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates and do not use derivative financial instruments 
all of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  in the future  the company may enter into transactions in other currencies 
an adverse change in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes  assuming that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive
