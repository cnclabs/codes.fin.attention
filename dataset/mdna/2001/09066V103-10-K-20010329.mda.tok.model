item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview biosphere medical  inc  we  the company or biosphere develops  markets and manufactures innovative medical device products for the treatment of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations using embolotherapy 
embolotherapy is a minimally invasive procedure in which materials that inhibit blood flow  referred to as embolic materials  such as our microspheres  are injected through a catheter into the blood vessels to inhibit blood flow to tumors and arteriovenous malformations 
by selectively blocking the tumor s blood supply  embolotherapy is designed to cause the tumor to shrink 
hypervascularized tumors are tumors that are supplied by a larger number of blood vessels than the number of blood vessels supplying the tissue surrounding the tumor 
arteriovenous malformations are abnormal connections between arteries and veins  frequently characterized by a dense and wide spread network of interconnecting blood vessels 
our lead product  embosphere microspheres  is an acrylic bead with a proprietary design that is used as an embolic material 
biosphere was originally incorporated under the name biosepra inc during  we strategically refocused our business on the development and commercialization of our proprietary microspheres for medical applications 
in february  we acquired a ownership interest in biosphere medical sa bmsa  a french societe anonyme 
in april  we increased our ownership interest in bmsa from to 
bmsa retains the license to the embolotherapy device that is the main focus of our business 
in may  we sold substantially all of our assets relating to our former core business  chromatography  and changed our name to biosphere medical  inc we have an option to acquire the remaining of bmsa at a later date 
as of december   sepracor inc  sepracor a specialty pharmaceutical company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
during  the we established two wholly owned subsidiaries to pursue the development of other microsphere technologies 
in may  biosphere medical japan  inc  a delaware corporation  was established to develop and commercialize embosphere microspheres as well as hepasphere sap microspheres in the far east 
in december  bsmd ventures  inc  also a delaware corporation  was established to explore and develop non embolotherapy applications with a specific focus on tissue engineering uses 
to this end  in january  bsmd ventures  inc entered into a strategic supply agreement with inamed corporation of santa barbara  california  a surgical and medical device company primarily engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of medical devices for the plastic and reconstructive surgery and aesthetic medicine markets 
under this multi year agreement  biosphere will supply its proprietary microspheres to inamed 
in exchange  inamed has agreed to pay to biosphere certain up front distribution access fees as well as milestone payments upon the successful completion of certain development benchmarks 
biosphere will also be entitled to royalty payments on net sales of resulting commercially approved products 
in april  we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration fda for embolization of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations 
in december  we commenced our pivotal phase ii clinical testing under an investigational device exemption of the safety and effectiveness of treating uterine fibroids by uterine artery embolization with our embosphere microspheres 
an investigational device exemption is a regulatory exemption granted by the fda to medical device manufacturers for the purpose of conducting clinical studies 
we intend  pending fda clearance for this indication  to promote our microspheres for the treatment of uterine fibroids 
we do not anticipate receiving this clearance before  if at all 
we received ce mark approval of our embosphere microspheres product in the european union in ce mark approval is a certification granted by european regulatory bodies  or by some manufacturers with satisfactory quality systems  that substantiates the compliance of products with specific standards of quality and or safety 
this approval is generally required prior to the commercialization of a medical device in the european union 
in january  we received marketing approval of our embosphere microspheres product in australia and canada 
we expect to file for marketing approval in japan for our hepasphere sap microspheres product for the treatment of liver cancer within the next months 
during the year ended december   we continued the implementation of our new strategic plan to develop our embosphere microspheres for the treatment of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations 
our revenue is primarily generated from product sales of embosphere microspheres in the united states  european union  australia  and canada 
product revenues also include the sale of barium and other ancillary products manufactured by us or by third parties 
we have experienced operating losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in connection with the execution of our business plan  we expect to experience continued losses for at least the next twelve month period 
the sale of our former chromatography business has been presented in the financial statements in accordance with discontinued operations accounting principles 
accordingly  the results of all discontinued operations have been excluded from the continuing operations and presented separately in the accompanying selected financial data 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in and  in the  increase from to is primarily attributable to the initiation of embosphere microsphere sales in the us following receipt of fda k clearance in april sales growth during also increased due to the initiation of embosphere microsphere sales within australia and canada  as well as the further penetration of the european markets 
to a lesser extent  the increase in total revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to the acquisition of bmsa in february of  whereby only ten months of revenue was recognized during versus a full year in cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was  compared to  in and  in  representing   and of product revenue  respectively 
the  increase in the cost of product revenues in the year ended december  was due to increased sales volume offset by a shift in the sales mix to lower costing embosphere microsphere products 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  of revenues compared with  of revenues for the same period in and  of revenues in the increase in gross margin for the year ended december  was attributable to a shift in product sales mix to the higher margin embosphere microsphere products  particularly in the us  as well as a reduction in the unit manufacturing costs caused by the full integration of the embosphere microsphere manufacturing process at our french production facility in the spring of research and development expenses increased to  in from  in and  in the  increase in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to clinical and regulatory costs incurred relative to seeking embosphere microsphere regulatory approval in the united states 
we anticipate future research and development expenses will increase as a result of the advancement of embosphere microsphere products through its recently initiated phase ii clinical trial for the uterine artery embolization treatment of uterine fibroids under an investigational device exemption granted by the fda 
additional expenses are also expected to result from the continued development and enhancement of our current products and product candidates 
selling  general and administrative expenses  net of non cash  non employee stock option acceleration charges  increased to  for the year ended december  from  in and  in the  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to the implementation of our product commercialization plan  including personnel costs  recruiting expenses  selling  marketing and all other expenses associated with developing and introducing a new business 
in connection with stock options previously issued to non employees  the company s board of directors authorized the company to accelerate the vesting of all non employee advisors stock options subject to variable accounting principles 
accordingly   in non cash compensation expense was recorded and presented as a separate line item within the statement of operations for the year ended december  the recorded  aggregate fair value of the non employee stock options was derived from the black scholes option pricing model 
interest income in the year ended december  was  compared to  in and  in the growth in interest income in each of the sequential years was due to the continued increase in average daily invested cash balances 
increased invested cash primarily resulted from the may sale of our discontinued chromatography operations and the proceeds from our february  and july  private equity placements 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in and to  in this sequential decrease was due primarily to the retirement of our significant debt in the second quarter of interest expense during primarily resulted from non cash interest charges generated from the potential obligation to purchase the remaining outstanding minority interest in bmsa 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements net loss from continuing operations increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in the increases are a direct result of the implementation of our strategic plan to develop  introduce and commercialize our microsphere and other product lines 
we anticipate net losses from operations will continue through at least the next twelve month period 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations from product sales  net proceeds provided by public and private equity offerings  funds provided by the sale of our former chromatography business  funds from sepracor  bank financing  equipment financing leases and to a lesser extent  exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents  an increase of  from  as of december  this increase primarily resulted from the net proceeds of our two private equity placement financings in offset  to a limited extent  by cash used to fund operations 
as of december   we had  in working capital 
for the year ended december   we used  in operating cash primarily to fund our marketing and product development activities and to finance working capital requirements 
cash used in operations is expected to increase in support of the company s further operational and product development efforts 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  of this amount   was used in connection with the april purchase of an additional equity interest in our majority owned subsidiary  biosphere medical  sa from this step acquisition  our total ownership interest in biosphere medical  s 
a increased to 
the remaining amount  approximately  was used to purchase property and equipment relating to establishing full manufacturing capabilities at bmsa and to obtain office equipment and furnishings in our new corporate headquarters in rockland  massachusetts 
future capital expenditures are anticipated to increase over the next twelve month period consistent with our plan to expand our manufacturing  sales and marketing presence in the united states  europe  the far east  australia and canada 
if available on favorable terms  we expect to finance certain future fixed asset acquisitions through leasing arrangements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  in both february and in july  we completed private equity placements resulting in the issuance of an aggregate  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately  the february private equity issuance included warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
cash provided by financing activities also includes  received in connection with the sale of approximately  shares of common stock through the exercise of options granted under our incentive stock option plans 
additionally  in march  bmsa entered into a  french franc  equivalent as of december  term loan with a french national bank that is payable over five years and accrues interest at per annum 
in collaboration with sepracor  we have available a revolving credit agreement with a bank under which we may borrow up to million  subject to limitations defined in the agreement and on borrowings outstanding by sepracor 
there were no borrowings outstanding by either the company or sepracor under this agreement as of december  interest on any outstanding borrowings is payable monthly in arrears at prime as of december  or the libor rate at december  plus 
we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to per annum on the average available unused line 
the company s ability to borrow under this credit line is dependent upon sepracor s maintenance of certain financial ratios and levels of cash and cash equivalents and tangible capital bases 
as of december   sepracor has informed us that all applicable lines of credit covenants have been satisfactorily met 
sepracor is guarantor of any amounts outstanding under the agreement 
we have entered into a security agreement with sepracor pursuant to which we have pledged to sepracor all of our us assets  including our equity ownership of bmsa as collateral for sepracor s guarantee to the bank 
bmsa is not a party to the agreement with sepracor and  therefore  has not pledged any of its assets 
the revolving credit agreement will expire on december  prior to december   we intend to negotiate a new revolving credit agreement containing similar terms  rates and conditions 
we believe that our existing cash and other working capital will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements  as currently planned  at least through the next twelve month period 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to changes in anticipated research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical and clinical testing  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the fda s regulatory process  the market s acceptance of any approved products  and other factors 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  the expansion of our laboratory and administrative functions as well as costs relating to further commercialization activities 
we may also need additional funds for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses  products and or technologies or upon exercise of a put option held by the minority interest holder of bmsa to require us to purchase the remaining interest 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements these additional funds may be raised from time to time through public or private sales of equity  through borrowings  or through other financings 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding that may be required on acceptable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
the company s investments in short term cash equivalents are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not believe that these exposures are material 
the company sells and distributes its products worldwide and the payables may be due in french currency or other local currencies 
therefore  the company may experience gains or losses upon the payment of these inter company obligations
