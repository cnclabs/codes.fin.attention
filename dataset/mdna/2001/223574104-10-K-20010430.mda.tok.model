inflation since inflation has slowed in recent years  the registrant does not believe that its business has been materially affected by the relatively modest rate of price increases in the economy 
however  pressures in the industry to reduce prices  which have impacted the registrant in the past  are expected to continue 
also the telecommunications industry has recently experienced the failure of several businesses  some of which are the registrant s wholesale customer and suppliers 
these failures not only have affected the registrant s fy results  but may impact future results 
the registrant continues to seek improvements in operations and efficiency through capital expenditures 
expenditures to improve the signaling system  information systems and the local area network are expected to result in operating costs savings  which could partially offset any future cost increases 
environmental matters the registrant is not a party to any legal proceedings or the subject of any claim regarding environmental matters generally incidental to its business 
in the opinion of management  compliance with the present environmental protection laws should not have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the registrant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the registrant s cash and investments exceed long term debt  therefore  the exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the marketable securities held by the registrant 
the registrant only invests in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
the registrant does not hold any derivatives related to its interest rate exposure 
the registrant also maintains long term debt at fixed rates 
due to the nature and amounts of the registrant s note payable  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect in the registrant s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
the registrant s exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates is also immaterial to the consolidated statements as a whole
