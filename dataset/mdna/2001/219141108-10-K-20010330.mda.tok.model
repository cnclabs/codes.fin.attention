item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a leading private provider of corrections  treatment and educational services to government agencies 
as of december   the company had contracts to operate facilities with a total service capacity of  the company s facilities are located in states and the district of columbia 
the company provides integrated facility development  design  construction and operational services to government agencies within three operating divisions a adult secure institutional  correctional and detention services  b juvenile treatment  educational and detention services and c pre release correctional and treatment services 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total service capacity  the service capacity and contracted beds in operation at the end of the periods shown and the average occupancy percentages 
year ended december  total service capacity residential    non residential community based    total    service capacity in operation end of period    contracted beds in operation end of period    average occupancy based on contracted beds in operation 
average occupancy excluding start up operations the company s service capacity is comprised of the number of beds available for service upon completion of construction of residential facilities and the average program capacity of non residential community based programs 
the utah doc selected the company s bid in june for the bed timpie valley correctional facility subject to final contract negotiations 
in  the utah doc declined to pursue this project  therefore the company s service capacity was reduced accordingly 
occupancy percentages are based on contracted service capacity of residential facilities in operation 
since certain facilities have service capacities that exceed contracted capacities  occupancy percentages can exceed of contracted capacity 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average occupancy in periods when the company has substantial start up activities 
the company derives substantially all its revenues from providing corrections  treatment and educational services to federal  state and local government agencies in the united states 
revenues for the company s services are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period or cost plus reimbursement 
factors which the company considers in determining the per diem rate to charge include a the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  b wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  c whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and d the anticipated average occupancy levels which the company believes could reasonably be maintained 
although the company has experienced higher operating margins in its adult secure institutional and pre release divisions as compared to the juvenile division  the company s operating margins generally vary from facility to facility based on the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility  the anticipated changes in operating costs over the term of the contract  and the company s ability to increase contract revenues 
the company has and expects to experience interim period operating margin differences due to the number of calendar days in the period  higher payroll taxes in the first half of the year  and salary and wage increases which are incurred prior to certain contract revenue increases 
the company is responsible for all facility operating expenses  except for certain debt service and lease payments with respect to facilities for which the company has only a management contract nine facilities in operation at december a majority of the company s facility operating expenses consist of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when the company commences operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating expenses increase 
the amount of the company s variable operating expenses  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities operated by the company 
the company s largest single operating expense  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and costs  has both a fixed and a variable component 
the company can adjust the staffing and payroll to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  but a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
personnel costs are subject to increase in tightening labor markets based on local economic and other conditions 
pre opening and start up expenses consist primarily of payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
in january  the company adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  or sop  and recorded a net of tax charge of approximately million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of the company s adoption of sop  the company began to expense pre opening and start up costs as incurred 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of the company s corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  finance  accounting  human resources  payroll  information systems and other services and costs of business development 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to contract requirements when the company begins receiving offenders or clients 
offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to three month period  although certain programs require a longer time period to reach break even occupancy levels 
the company incurs start up operating losses at new facilities until break even occupancy levels are reached 
quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to the company s commencing management of a new or expanded facility as the company incurs start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
results of operations the company s historical operating results reflect a significant expansion of the company s business 
material fluctuations in the company s results of operations are principally the result of the timing and effect of acquisitions  the level of new contract development activity conducted by the company  and occupancy rates at company operated facilities 
the company s acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the operating results of the acquired businesses have been reported in the company s operating results since the date of acquisition 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentages of revenues represented by certain items in the company s historical consolidated statements of operations year ended december  revenues operating expenses pre opening and start up expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

construction and activation activities commenced immediately 
in june  the fbop issued a stop work order pending a re evaluation of their environmental documentation supporting the decision to award the contract 
the environmental study was completed with a finding of no significant impact 
while the stop work order remains in effect  management of the company believes it will be lifted and construction will be resumed in the near term 
development and construction costs for the new morgan academy and the moshannon valley correctional center have been financed with the company s lease financing arrangement discussed below under long term credit facilities 
long term credit facilities 
effective july   the company formalized terms under the credit facility with a group of financial institutions 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million under a revolving line of credit 
the revolving credit commitment is reduced by million quarterly beginning in january the credit facility matures in july and bears interest  at the election of the company  at either the prime rate plus a margin of to  or a rate which is to above the applicable libor rate  depending on the level of borrowings 
at december   the margin was above the libor rate 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  including the stock of all of the company s subsidiaries  does not permit the payment of cash dividends  and requires the company to comply with certain leverage  net worth and debt service coverage covenants 
at february   the company had million outstanding under the revolving line of credit  therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was million 
additionally  the credit facility provides the company with an increased capacity to enter into operating lease agreements for the acquisition or development of operating facilities 
this lease financing arrangement provides for funding to the lessor under the operating leases of up to million  of which approximately million had been utilized as of february  the remaining capacity under this lease financing arrangement is expected to be utilized to complete the moshannon valley correctional center 
the leases under this arrangement have a term of five years  include purchase and renewal options  and provide for residual value guarantees for each lease which average of the total cost and would be due by the company upon termination of the leases 
upon termination of a lease  the company could either exercise a purchase option or the facilities could be sold to a third party 
the company believes the fair value of the leased facilities will equal or exceed the residual guaranteed amounts 
lease payments under the lease financing arrangement are variable and are adjusted for changes in interest rates 
concurrent with the closing of the credit facility  the company s million subordinated bridge loan agreement was refinanced with proceeds from a note and equity purchase agreement subordinated notes 
the subordinated notes have a seven year term and are interest only  which is payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 
in conjunction with the issuance of the subordinated notes  the company issued warrants to purchase  shares of the common stock at an exercise price of 
the warrants may only be exercised by a full payment of cash to the company of the exercise price or by the cancellation of company indebtedness to the warrant holder 
the company has outstanding million of senior secured notes the senior notes

cash flows from operating activities 
for the year ended december   the company reported net cash provided by operating activities of million 
cash provided by operating activities was reduced by approximately million due to the november acquisition of interventions illinois which did not include working capital 
deferred costs and other 
at december   the company had deferred professional fees and other costs totaling million related to its efforts on a facility sale and leaseback transaction 
upon consummation of this transaction  the transaction costs will be included in the determination of the gain from the sale which will be deferred over the initial lease term 
if management of the company determines that it is doubtful that this transaction will be consummated  these transaction costs will be expensed in the period such determination is made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had deferred acquisition costs totaling  related to the anticipated purchase of real property in fort greely  alaska 
management anticipates that this property will be used in conjunction with the operations of an adult secure institution for the state of alaska 
if management determines that a contract to operate this facility in fort greely  alaska will not be awarded  the company will likely not purchase the real property and the deferred acquisition costs will be expensed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   accounts receivable include costs totaling million for direct costs incurred by the company since june for payroll and other operating costs related to the moshannon valley correctional center since the issuance of the stop work order 
these costs were incurred at the direction of the fbop with the understanding that such costs would be reimbursed

in the event any portion of these costs are not reimbursed by the fbop  such costs will be expensed 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million and related principally to a an expansion of the big spring complex  b the purchase of a building in pennsylvania  c purchases of furniture and equipment for the new morgan academy  and d certain software development costs 
management believes that the cash flows generated from operations  together with the credit available under the credit facility and the operating lease capacity thereunder  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s committed capital and working capital requirements for currently awarded contracts 
it is not anticipated that the current financing arrangements will provide sufficient financing to fund construction costs related to future adult secure institutional contract awards  or significant expansions or acquisitions 
the company anticipates obtaining additional sources of financing to fund such activities 
inflation other than personnel and offender medical costs at certain facilities during  management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations during the past three years 
most of the company s facility management contracts provide for payments to the company of either fixed per diem fees or per diem fees that increase by only small amounts during the terms of the contracts 
inflation could substantially increase the company s personnel costs the largest component of operating expenses or other operating expenses at rates faster than any increases in contract revenues
