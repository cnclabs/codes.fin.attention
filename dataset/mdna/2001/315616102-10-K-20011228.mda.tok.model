the increase in fiscal was the result of higher production costs associated with hardware configuration enhancements and increased personnel costs  including training and consulting 
total operating expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in total operating expense in fiscal  compared to the prior year  is primarily the result of our continued investment in international operations  additional personnel costs  facilities costs  an increase in bad debt as a result of our relationship with exodus and non recurring restructuring charges

provision for excess inventory 
due to changes in current market conditions and a revision of our sales forecast  a review was made of our inventory needs and an assessment of our future purchase commitments during fiscal as a result  we determined two provisions for excess inventory and future purchase commitments would be recorded 
the first provision for excess inventory was charged to cost of revenues in the amount of million  which consisted of a million inventory valuation allowance and approximately  of future purchase commitments 
as of september   million of this reserve had been utilized

sales and marketing expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal year in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased by from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal  compared to the prior year  was due to an increase in headcount and the related costs  an increase in advertising and promotional activities including activities related to new product launches

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million  and in fiscal by from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal year relates primarily to personnel related costs and an increase in facilities cost related to the new spokane office 
the increase in fiscal  compared to the prior period  is also due to a significant increase in headcount 
our future success is dependent  in large part on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new  technologically advanced products that meet the sophisticated needs of our customers 
we expect research and development expenses to remain at a consistent level with fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related costs of our executive  finance  human resource and legal personnel  third party professional service fees  and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by in fiscal to million from in fiscal year these expenses increased in fiscal year by from million for fiscal year the increases in fiscal were due to an increase in bad debt expense due to the relationship with exodus communications and an increase in headcount and other payroll related costs

restructuring charge 
during the first fiscal quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with management decision to bring operating expenses in line with the business

as a result of change in the business revenue growth model  we terminated employees throughout all divisions of the company 
as of september   substantially all of the restructuring charge accrued for during the first fiscal quarter of  had been paid 
unearned compensation 
we have recorded a total of million of stock compensation costs since our inception through september  these charges represent the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our employees and outside directors 
these options generally vest ratably over a four year period 
we are amortizing these costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
and have recorded stock compensation charges of million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
we expect to recognize amortization expense related to unearned compensation of approximately  and  during the years ended september  and  respectively

the income tax provision increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and zero in fiscal the increase in the provision for income taxes was caused by our decision to provide for a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in fiscal year fasb statement provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence at the time  the valuation allowance was partially reversed in fiscal year for the assets we considered realizable 
in fiscal year  the changes in the current economic environment caused us reevaluate the need to provide for a full valuation allowance 
based on the weight of all the available positive and negative evidence  we determined that a full valuation allowance should be provided to completely offset the net deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources in thousands year ended september working capital cash and cash investments cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities from our inception through may  we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the sale of approximately million in equity securities 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock and raised approximately million  net of offering costs 
in october  we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock and raised approximately million  net of offering costs 
on june   we entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with nokia finance international bv nfi 
under this agreement  we issued and sold to nfi i  shares of common stock and ii warrants the warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock 
we received total proceeds of million  net of million in estimated issuance costs from the sale of these shares and the warrants 
the warrants allow nfi to purchase additional shares of common stock to increase its ownership percentage in the company up to a maximum of one share less than during three ten business day periods beginning on december   june  and december   at an exercise price equal to the average day closing price before the start of each period 
we recorded the issuance of the common stock and warrants by allocating the net proceeds to the common stock and the warrants  based upon their relative fair values at the date of issuance 
the fair value allocated to the warrants was million based on an independent valuation 
based upon the relative fair value at the date of issuance  the amount of net proceeds allocated to the warrants and included as a component of common stock was million 
the amount allocated to the common stock was million 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal cash used in operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from operating losses  partially offset by a decrease in net accounts receivable 
cash used for operating expenses in fiscal resulted from increases in accounts receivable due to increased sales and other current assets  which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenues 

table of contents cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  the million used in fiscal includes million used to purchase property and equipment  partially offset by a construction refund 
the cash used for investing activities in fiscal was the result of million used to purchase property and equipment and million used to invest in restricted cash in order to obtain an irrevocable standby letter of credit to secure our commitment to lease office space 
in fiscal  the million cash used in investing activities was the result of million used to purchase property and equipment and million used to invest in restricted cash related to the lease 
as of september   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
in april  we entered into a lease agreement on two buildings for a new corporate headquarters 
the lease commenced in july on the first building  and the lease on the second building commenced in october the lease for both buildings expires in with an option for renewal 
we established a restricted escrow account in connection with this lease agreement 
under the term of the lease  a million irrevocable standby letter of credit is required through november  unless the lease is terminated before then 
this amount has been included on our balance sheet as of september  as a component of restricted cash 
although we have no other material commitments  we anticipate an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with our anticipated growth in our operations  infrastructure and personnel 
in the future we may also require a larger inventory of products in order to provide better availability to customers and achieve purchasing efficiencies 
any such increase can be expected to reduce cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we expect that our existing cash balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

the provisions of fas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the implications of adoption of fas and anticipates adopting its provisions in fiscal year risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 
our quarterly operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
in particular  we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from just one account  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
in the past  a significant portion of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter 
accordingly  a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter 
furthermore  we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed 
consequently  if revenue levels fall below our expectations  our net income will decrease because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues 
see item of part ii management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations will likely seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
our business may be harmed by economic and market conditions 
our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally and market conditions in the internet and technology sectors in particular 
unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending has contributed to a decline in our product sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal a continued downturn in the economic conditions or economic uncertainty could adversely impact potential customers ability and willingness to purchase our products  which would cause a further decline in our sales and operating results 
our success depends on sales of our big ip 
we currently derive approximately of our net revenues from sales of our big ip product line 
in addition  we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of big ip in the future 
implementation of our strategy depends upon big ip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers 
if big ip is unable to solve these problems for our customers  our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
our success depends on our timely development of new products and features 
we expect the internet traffic and content management market to be characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes  and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers 
if we are unable to identify  develop and deploy new 
table of contents products and new product features on a timely basis  or if those products do not gain market acceptance  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
see item of part i business product development 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging internet traffic and content management market 
our markets are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our principal competitors in the internet traffic and content management market include cisco systems  cacheflow  foundry networks  inktomi  network appliances  extreme networks  nortel networks and radware 
we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the internet traffic and content management market 
in addition  larger companies with significant resources  brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing internet traffic and content management solutions and emerge as significant competitors 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic and content management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products 
see item of part i business competition 
the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase  which may negatively impact gross profits 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
therefore  in order to maintain our gross profits  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline  which will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle 
our products have a lengthy sales cycle which is difficult to predict 
historically  our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months 
sales of big ip  dns  global site  see it  and edge fx require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits 
the sale of our products is subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors 
as a result  our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships 
our sales strategy requires that we establish multiple and maintain distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers  original equipment manufacturers  systems integrators  internet service providers and other channel partners 
we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels  and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
during fiscal no single reseller or customer exceeded of net revenue or our accounts receivable balance 
if we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels  our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed 

table of contents our expansion into international markets may not succeed 
we intend to continue expanding into international markets 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our products internationally 
international sales represented of our net revenues for the year ended september   of our net revenues for the year ended september  and of our net revenues for the year ended september  we have engaged sales personnel in australia  europe  and asia pacific 
our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in selected countries in the european and asia pacific markets 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate  and we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce 
as our international sales increase  our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks 
these risks include risks related to foreign currency exchange rates  managing foreign sales offices  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in specific countries  changes in laws and tariffs  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries  foreign regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract  train and retain qualified marketing and sales  professional services and customer support personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and finance personnel  many of whom will be difficult to replace 
the complexity of our internet traffic and content management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support  as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort  requires us to retain highly trained professional services  customer support and sales personnel 
in spite of the economic downturn  competition for qualified professional services  customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products 
our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in our stock price  since these employees are generally granted stock options 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products 
we rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products 
we outsource the manufacturing of our pre configured  industry standard hardware platforms to three contract manufacturers who assemble these hardware platforms to our specifications 
we have experienced minor delays in shipments from these contract manufacturers in the past which have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
we may experience delays in the future or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue  may seriously harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 
see item of part i business manufacturing 

table of contents our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third party sources 
we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from limited sources 
lead times for these components vary significantly 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components  or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time  will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
see item of part i business manufacturing 
undetected software errors may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products 
the occurrence of any of these problems may seriously harm our business and results of operations 
we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  we have not entered into non competition agreements with several of our former employees 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims or initiate litigation against us or our contract manufacturers  suppliers or customers with respect to existing or future products 
our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions related to our technology  which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims against our customers 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors 
any of these claims  with or without merit  may be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology  develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
our stock price may be volatile 
our stock price has historically experienced substantial volatility 
in addition  the stock market and technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been 
table of contents unrelated to the performance of these companies 
in the future  the price of our stock may be affected by a number of factors  including variations between our operating results and analysts expectations  announcements by us or our competitors  or general market conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our investment portfolio 
the board of directors authorized one transaction to purchase and sell publicly traded company options 
our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio with the exception of treasury securities  commercial paper and money market funds  which are exempt from size limitation 
the policy limits all short term investments to mature in two years or less  with the average maturity being one year or less 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase

currently the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  as we continue to expand our operations internationally  they may become significant in the future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  however we may do so in the future
