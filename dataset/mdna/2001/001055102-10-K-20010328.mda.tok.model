exh japanese economy for the last several years  japan has been working to overcome its depressed economy 
the financial strength of many japanese businesses continued to deteriorate in with some experiencing bankruptcy or requesting financial protection or assistance 
as we have indicated in the past  japan s weak economy has created a challenging environment for aflac japan  as yields available for new investments remain at historically low levels and consumer confidence continues to lag 
the time required for the japanese economy to fully recover remains uncertain 
aflac japan sales aflac japan produced strong sales results during the last three years  despite the weak japanese economy 
new annualized premium sales were million in  up  million in  up  and million in  up 
new annualized premium sales in yen were billion yen in  up  billion yen in  up  and billion yen in  up 
the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of in  in and in reflect the high persistency of aflac japan s business and the sales of new policies 
annualized premiums in force were billion yen  billion yen and billion yen at december   and  respectively 
as a result of fluctuations in year end exchange rates  annualized premiums in force  as measured in dollars  were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
in addition to strong sales growth  we also continued to grow our distribution system in japan 
during  we recruited  new agencies 
we believe that new agencies will continue to be attracted to aflac japan s high commissions  superior products  customer service and brand image 
we continued to invest in marketing to improve sales 
an improved incentive pay system for aflac japan s employed sales managers was introduced in to provide better rewards for sales performance 
we introduced a new optional commission contract in july that was structured to attract new agents 
the new contract pays a higher first year commission and limits renewal commissions to nine years 
our original contract pays renewal commissions for the life of the policy 
we increased expenditures during the last three years for expanded sales promotion efforts in japan and will continue to do so in additionally  we will continue to aggressively promote our brand and products through advertising 
we plan on improving the products we offer and introducing new ones 
we will invest in new technologies  including our laptop sales aid  to maintain our cost and service advantages 
we also continued to refine our product line 
in mid  we began selling new  lower premium cancer life and care products to meet the needs of cost sensitive buyers 
approximately of new cancer life and of care policy sales were from the lower premium products 
at the end of  we introduced a major revision to our cancer life product 
our new cancer life product offers a variety of coverage choices to our customers 
as a exh result  employers will be able to customize an aflac cancer life policy that best suits the needs of their workers 
rider max  which provides accident and medical sickness benefits as a rider to our cancer life policy  has been extremely popular since its introduction in aflac japan s sales mix as measured in yen has changed during the last few years 
cancer life sales accounted for of total sales in  in  and in rider max accounted for of sales in  in  and in ordinary life and annuities accounted for of sales in compared with in and in although consumer confidence continued to lag because of the economic worries and concerns over the financial strength of insurers  aflac products remained popular 
our reputation for financial strength  combined with a diverse product line and aggressive sales and marketing  helped us grow over the last three years in spite of the difficult economy 
aflac sold more insurance policies than any other life insurance company in japan for the first half of the japanese fiscal year 
our objective for is to increase sales in yen by compared with aflac japan investments investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations  investment yields achievable on new investments and foreign currency exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income 
the stronger yen has the effect of reducing dollar denominated investment income as reported in yen 
also  rates of return on yen denominated debt securities in japan remained low in for instance  the yield on year japanese government bonds  as measured by a composite index  fluctuated from a high of in september to a low of in december and closed the year at 
investment income in yen increased in  compared with in and in aflac japan s new money rates for investments in debt securities including dollar denominated investments were for  for and for the overall rate of return  net of investment expenses  on aflac japan s average investments and cash at amortized cost has declined 
these returns  which were in  in and in  reflect the cumulative effect of lower investment yields available in japan since the early s 
aflac japan has invested in reverse dual currency securities and other private placement securities to secure higher yields than japanese government bonds would have provided while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality 
we believe that we can invest new money in the near term at an adequate spread over policy premium pricing assumptions for new business and assumed interest rates for policy liabilities 
to compensate for lower investment yields  we have implemented premium rate increases over the last several years  including one in  which should contribute to stability in the pretax operating profit margin 
exh insurance deregulation in japan trade talks in and between the governments of the united states and japan  and japan s plan for a financial big bang  produced a framework for the deregulation of the japanese insurance industry 
these measures called for the gradual liberalization of the industry through the year and included provisions to avoid radical change in the third sector of the insurance industry 
aflac and other foreign owned insurers  as well as many small to medium sized japanese insurers  operate primarily in the third sector 
as of january   additional insurance companies were permitted to sell the type of third sector products that aflac japan currently offers 
we anticipate that by july   all insurance companies will be permitted to compete in the third sector 
as a result  we expect competition to increase 
however  we also expect increased product and distribution opportunities for aflac japan 
in order to respond to the expected increase in competition and the opportunities available to us  we have taken action to expand our marketing initiatives and enhance our competitiveness 
in the third quarter of  aflac japan and dai ichi mutual life insurance company dai ichi life agreed to a major marketing alliance that anticipates the sale of each company s products through their respective distribution systems 
the initial focus will be the sale of aflac japan s cancer life and rider max products through dai ichi life s sales force of  people 
sales are expected to commence in the second quarter of  pending approval by regulatory authorities 
as previously mentioned  we plan to continue expanding our distribution system through the addition of new agencies 
in support of this objective  we introduced a commission contract in july that is structured to attract new agents 
we recognize that we will face increasing competition in the future  and we continue to look for ways to improve 
at the same time  we believe companies will find it difficult to compete with us because our low cost structure allows us to provide competitive benefits and services to policyholders and above average compensation to our sales force 
aflac japan other the increase in the expense ratio in and was primarily due to increased expenditures for sales promotion  marketing and advertising 
the benefit ratio has declined primarily due to the mix of business shifting to newer products  which have a lower loss ratio than the earlier versions of the cancer life product 
the pretax operating profit margin was in  compared with in and in the expansion of the margin was largely due to the declining benefit ratio 
in july  we initiated a voluntary internal compliance review to examine the solicitation practices of our agents and to determine the extent to which inappropriate premium discounts  if any  may have been given to customers  and to put in place any corrective measures necessary to ensure full regulatory compliance in the future 
we informed the fsa at the time the review was initiated 
the results of this review have been provided to exh the fsa  including aflac japan s proposed steps to strengthen and improve the internal control system and the internal disciplinary actions that have been taken against certain employees 
the fsa requested that aflac japan make periodic reports regarding the progress being made to implement these measures 
the fsa also notified aflac japan that it will not impose any administrative sanction in connection with the results of this compliance review 
although japan s economic outlook remains uncertain  we continue to believe it is one of the best insurance markets in the world for supplemental insurance products 
the need for our products in japan continues  and we remain optimistic about increasing penetration within existing groups  selling new products  opening new accounts and developing additional supplemental products for the japanese market

the percentage increases in premium income reflect the growth of premiums in force 
the increases in annualized premiums in force of in  in and in were favorably affected by increased sales at the worksite primarily through cafeteria plans and an improvement in the persistency of several products 
annualized premiums in force were billion at december   billion at december   and billion at december  aflac us investments investment income increased in  compared with in and in the larger increase in was due to investing the majority of the annual profits repatriated from aflac japan in investment income in also benefited from investing the proceeds from the sale of the television business in during  available cash flow was invested at an average yield of compared with during and during the overall return on average invested assets  net of investment expenses  was for  compared with for and for aflac us other we expect the operating expense ratio  excluding discretionary advertising expenses  to remain relatively level in the future 
state of the art technology is one way we can control expense growth  and smartapp  a laptop based  point of sale system  is a good example 
in  smartapp enabled us to process approximately of our payroll business electronically 
about half of these policies required no human intervention 
the electronic imaging of our claims and correspondence is also benefiting our expense ratio 
by improving administrative systems and controlling other costs  we have been able to redirect funds in recent years to our advertising program without significantly affecting the operating expense ratio 
the aggregate benefit ratio has been relatively stable 
the mix of business has shifted toward accident disability policies  which have lower benefit ratios than other products 
we expect the pretax operating profit margin to remain approximately the same in we continue to believe that there are significant opportunities to market high quality  affordable supplemental insurance products in the us marketplace

financial accounting standards board statements we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in investment securities and other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative will be included in either earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the intended use of the derivative instrument 
this standard will change the accounting for our cross currency and interest rate swaps 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we will be required to recognize in net earnings the change in unrealized gains losses on the interest rate components of our cross currency swaps see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative effect for adopting this new accounting standard as of january   will increase liabilities and decrease shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately million  representing the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments that have not been recorded in the financial statements at december  the adoption of sfas no 
will increase volatility in reported net earnings in the future 
if this accounting standard had been in effect on january   net earnings would have increased by approximately million for the year ended december   related to the change in fair value of the interest rate components of the cross currency swaps 
for information regarding other new statements of financial accounting standards  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
analysis of financial condition balance sheet during the last two years  our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations 
the investment portfolios of aflac japan and aflac us have continued to grow and primarily consist of investment grade securities 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes 
the exchange rate at december   was yen to one us dollar  or weaker than the december   exchange rate of 
the weaker yen rate decreased reported investments and cash by billion  total assets by billion and total liabilities by billion  compared with the amounts that would have been reported for if the exchange rate exh had remained unchanged from year end see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market risks of financial instruments our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate exposure results from the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities 
we use modified duration analysis  which provides a measure of price percentage volatility  to estimate the amount of sensitivity to interest rate changes in our debt securities 
for example  if the current duration of a debt security is five  then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately if market interest rates decrease by basis points 
likewise  the fair value of the debt security will decrease by approximately if market interest rates increase by basis points 
the estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of our debt security investments  notes payable and cross currency swaps follows sensitivity of fair values of financial instruments to interest rate changes december market basis market basis in millions value points value points debt securities fixed maturity securities yen denominated     dollar denominated     perpetual debentures yen denominated     dollar denominated total debt securities     notes payable   cross currency swaps included in other liabilities excludes capitalized leases should significant amounts of unrealized losses occur because of increases in market yields  we would not expect to realize significant losses because we have the ability to hold such securities to maturity 
exh the unrealized gains and losses on debt securities  less amounts applicable to policy liabilities and deferred income taxes  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the portion of unrealized gains credited to policy liabilities represents gains that would not inure to the benefit of our shareholders if such gains were actually realized

for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefit liabilities is longer than that of the related invested assets due to the unavailability of acceptable long duration yen denominated securities 
the average duration of policy liabilities was approximately years in both and the average duration of the yen denominated debt securities was approximately years in and nine years in currently  when our debt securities mature  the proceeds are reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years 
however  the investment yield on new investments exceeds interest requirements on policies issued in recent years 
since  premium rates on new business have been increased several times the latest occurred in july to help offset the lower investment yields available 
over the next five years  billion at amortized cost with an average yield of  of aflac japan s yen denominated debt securities are scheduled to mature 
we have outstanding interest rate swaps on billion yen million of variable interest rate yen denominated bank borrowings 
these swaps reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on borrowing costs and effectively change our interest rates from variable to fixed 
therefore  movements in market interest rates should have no material effect on earnings 
exh at december   we also had yen denominated bank borrowings in the amount of billion yen million with a blended variable interest rate of 
the effect on net earnings in due to changes in market interest rates was immaterial

net unrealized gains of billion on investment securities at december   consisted of billion in gross unrealized gains and billion in gross unrealized losses 
aflac invests primarily within the japanese  us and euroyen debt securities markets 
we are exposed to credit risk in our investment activity 
credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions 
we require that all securities have an initial rating of class or as determined by the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners 
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of our investments and use a variety of credit rating services to monitor these criteria 
applying those various credit ratings to a standardized rating system based on the categories of a nationally recognized rating service  the percentages of our debt securities  at amortized cost  as of december were as follows aaa aa a bbb bb 
the issuers of two debt securities held in our investment portfolio experienced significant credit rating downgrades during the first half of during the second quarter of  we sold one security carried in the available for sale category at a pretax loss of million 
we recorded a pretax impairment loss of million on the other security  which was carried in the held to maturity category

aflac japan has made investments in the private placement market to secure higher yields than those available from japanese government bonds

debt in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with japanese regulatory authorities to issue up to billion yen of yen denominated samurai notes 
united states residents or entities are not permitted to purchase or hold these securities

we received net proceeds of billion yen million after issue costs

the notes are redeemable at our option at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make whole amount 
we received net proceeds of million after discount and issue costs 
a portion of the proceeds is being used to construct a new administrative office building in the united states 
we entered into cross currency swaps that have the effect of converting the dollar denominated principal and interest into yen denominated obligations 
the notional amount of the cross currency swaps is million billion yen with a blended fixed interest rate of 
at december   we recorded a liability in the amount of million for the fair value of the swaps 
aflac incorporated has an unsecured reducing revolving credit agreement that provides for bank borrowings through july in either us dollars or japanese yen 
at december   billion yen million were outstanding under this agreement 
aflac incorporated also has an unsecured revolving credit agreement that provides for bank borrowings through november in either us dollars or japanese yen 
at december   billion yen million were outstanding 
we have entered into interest rate swaps that effectively change the interest rates on a portion of these bank borrowings from variable to fixed 
we make interest payments to the banks based on variable interest rates  and we pay to  or receive from  the swap counterparties an amount necessary to equal the fixed rate 
when any portion of these loans or notes is denominated in yen  the principal amounts as stated in dollars will fluctuate due to changes in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we have designated these yen denominated borrowings and the cross currency swaps as a hedge of our net investment in aflac japan 
foreign currency translation gains losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
outstanding principal and related accrued interest payable on these yen denominated items are translated into dollars at end of period exchange rates 
the ratio of debt to total capitalization debt plus shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized gains on investment securities was as of december  and as of december  for further information concerning swaps and notes payable  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
policyholder guaranty funds under insurance guaranty fund laws in most us states  insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business 
such assessments have not been material to us in the past 
we believe that future assessments relating to companies in the exh united states currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
in  the japanese government established the life insurance policyholders protection corporation 
funding by the life insurance industry  as determined by government legislation  is made over a year period 
we recognize charges for our estimated share of any assessment as funding legislation is enacted 
we periodically review our estimated liability for policyholder protection fund assessments based on updated information and any adjustments are reflected in net earnings 
for further information regarding the policyholder protection fund  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  two japanese life insurance companies filed applications with the court for protection under a special reorganization law for financial institutions 
japanese government officials have indicated that they do not expect any additional protection fund assessments to be imposed on the insurance industry for the financial problems of these insurers 
shareholders equity our insurance operations continue to provide the primary sources of liquidity 
capital needs are also supplemented by borrowed funds 
the principal sources of cash from insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
the primary uses of cash for insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to aflac incorporated for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the ownership of investment grade debt securities 
aflac insurance policies generally are not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
also  the majority of our policies provide indemnity benefits rather than reimbursement for actual medical costs and therefore are generally not subject to the risks of medical cost inflation 
the achievement of continued long term growth will require growth in aflac s statutory capital and surplus 
we may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by aflac incorporated from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
in october  we received million from the issuance of samurai notes in japan and in april  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior notes  which increased our capital resources 
we believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available for capital expenditures  business expansion and the funding of our share repurchase program 
aflac incorporated capital resources are largely dependent upon the ability of aflac to pay management fees and dividends 
the georgia insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to aflac incorporated 
the georgia insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of statutory earnings for the previous year  or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the georgia insurance department must approve service arrangements exh and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to aflac incorporated 
a life insurance company s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from generally accepted accounting principles and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
the naic has recodified statutory accounting principles sap to promote standardization throughout the industry 
these new accounting principles were effective january   and are to be applied prospectively
