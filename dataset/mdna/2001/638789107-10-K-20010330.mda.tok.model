overview natrol s core business is the manufacturing and marketing of branded  high quality dietary supplements 
the company sells its core products under the natrol brand name through multiple distribution channels throughout the united states  including domestic health food stores and mass market drug  retail and grocery store chains 
in addition to the core brand  natrol sells herbal teas under the laci le beau brand name within the same channels of trade as the natrol core brand 
the company also markets sports nutrition products under the prolab brand name 
prolab products are sold primarily in the health food store channel of trade as well as health clubs and gyms and internationally in select countries through international distributors 
the company acquired the laci le beau brand of teas in october and the prolab sports nutrition line of products in october another aspect of the company s business is the marketing of nutraceutical grade raw materials  primarily garlic and other vegetable powders to other manufacturers of nutritional supplement products 
the company also manufactures certain products pursuant to contracts with customers who distribute the products under their own private labels 
the company s strategy with respect to private label sales is to take advantage of its excess manufacturing capacity by offering to manufacture products for other vendors 
the company does not foresee adding capacity in order to meet private label demand 
the growth of the company s revenue has been a result of success in gaining additional distribution in new retail outlets and new channels of distribution  new product introductions  as well as the addition of new product lines and businesses through acquisition 
natrol products are now visible to some degree in most mass market chain drug retail outlets such as walgreens  rite aid  walmart  eckerd  cvs  and target  most health food stores including gnc  whole foods markets  and wild oats and  to a more limited degree  grocery stores such as albertson s and ralphs 
natrol s growth has been supported by the introduction of new products 
melatonin  dhea st 
john s wort  and msm were introduced in   and respectively and have heavily affected sales in each of those years as well as the year following 
typically  hot new products attract a wide audience that drives high volumes of initial sales 
these high volumes generally taper off as fad users stop using the product 
while sales of hot products can fade  sales of such products typically reach a base level that is sustained by a core group of users 
the length of these cycles can vary from less than a year to several years 
melatonin  dhea  st 
john s wort and gingko biloba have all cycled in this fashion 
sales of gingko biloba and st john s wort fell approximately and respectively in the year when compared to in each case the base level of sales fell to below of the product s peak 
the company has also grown through acquisitions  completing two in and one in each acquisition introduced the company to a new line of business 
the essentially pure ingredient epi supply business  acquired in early  accounted for of the company s sales in the laci le beau tea business  also acquired in  accounted for approximately of the company s sales in prolab  which was acquired at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  accounted for of the company s revenue during the year as part of its business strategy  the company expects to continue to consider acquisitions that management believes are synergistic to the company s core business and which will be accretive to shareholders 
industry trends during the year were negative and  although the company did increase its business with certain customers  the company did not gain a volume of new distribution with any particular customer that it could categorize as material to its operations 
the company also failed to introduce any new product that contributed materially to the growth of its revenues 
no acquisitions were made in the year product returns are a recurring part of the company s business 
products may be returned for various reasons including expiration dates or lack of sufficient sales velocity 
the company accrues a reserve for returns based on historical data 
during  returns were far higher than in past years and  for this reason  additional expense was incurred in the year for returns 
although the company has increased its reserves  there is no guarantee that future returns will not exceed the high levels experienced in the year or will be in line with past return percentages 
moreover  it is possible that current reserves may be inadequate and  as such  the company could  at some future time  have to accept returns substantially larger in scope than those received in the past and that these returns could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the risk of returns is amplified by the current industry trend see industry trends which shows negative growth 
if this trend continues  retailers may decide to reduce inventory levels from their suppliers  including natrol  by returning goods from their warehouse distribution centers 
acquisitions during during  the company completed two acquisitions 
on february   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of pure gar  lp the acquisition involved the purchase of two brands of garlic supplements  quintessence and highgar farms  as well as a bulk ingredient business 
in connection with the acquisition  the company recorded a purchase price of million with million of goodwill which is being amortized on a straight line basis over years  amounting to  of annual amortization expense 
upon completing the acquisition  the company began the process of developing its own garlipure line of natrol garlic supplements and then filling shelf space formerly allocated by retailers to the acquired highgar farms and quintessence lines with its garlipure line 
many of the company s ingredient customers are direct competitors to the company s core branded natrol business and as such the company maintains a chinese wall between its epi division and the rest of the company 
the purpose of this information wall is to ensure that epi customer sales information is not transferred to the rest of the company 
the company s pure gar ingredient supply business was renamed essentially pure ingredients in january  on october   the company acquired certain of the assets of laci le beau which consisted of laci le beau corporation as well as certain related companies 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was million in cash 
laci le beau is a formulator  packager and distributor of specialty teas sold through the health channel of distribution as well as in food stores  drug stores and mass market merchandisers 
these channels of distribution are essentially the same as those used by the company s natrol branded products 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company acquired no accounts receivable  nor did it assume any liabilities of laci le beau 
the acquisition is being accounted for using the purchase method  and  accordingly  the assets acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the assets purchased was approximately million and is being amortized over years 
in october   the company purchased all of the stock of prolab nutrition  inc prolab for  in cash and  shares of common stock

the level of returns was approximately of gross sales  a level that is approximately three times higher than that experienced by the company in prior years 
the company believes this rate of returns was caused by industry trends which caused retailers to decrease warehouse stocking levels as well as the failure of certain products introduced during and to gain popularity with consumers 
the company cannot predict when or if this high rate of returns will decrease 
only one line of product  msm joint care products  which accounted for approximately of revenue  accounted for more than of the company s revenue 
no other product line accounted for more than of the company s revenues in gross profit 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million  in as compared to million in the gross margin decreased sharply to in from in the decrease was due primarily to the heavy returns as well as the percentage of the company s business generated by prolab 
the gross profit percentage from prolab products is approximately one third less than for the rest of the company s business 
returns are deducted from gross sales when calculating net revenue 
in a majority of instances  the product returned is close to expiration and as such has no value 
the original cost of goods of this returned product must then be included in the overall cost of goods calculation which in turn increases cost of goods and decreases the gross margin

selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenue  selling and marketing expenses increased to in from in  the highest in the company s history

these expenses were amplified by the general downturn in the industry as the company created incentives for retailers to stimulate sales at the consumer level though price off and other promotions
