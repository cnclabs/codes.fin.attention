item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion set forth below supplements the information found in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview from the time it entered the staffing business in october through january  the company completed acquisitions 
in february  it completed one additional acquisition 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for on a purchase basis and the results of operations of each of the businesses acquired have been included in the company s historical consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
certain of these acquisitions provide for contingent payments by the company as a part of the purchase consideration based upon the operating results of the acquired businesses for specified future periods 
the acquisitions were financed by the company principally through its issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowings under credit facilities 
staffing personnel placed by the company are employees of the company 
the company is responsible for employee related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  disability and life insurance to its billable employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees for their services before receiving payment from their customers  often resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company increases revenues through acquisitions and or internal growth  these receivables will grow and there will be greater requirements for borrowing availability under its credit facility to fund current operations 
the company had been reporting its results through two operating segments staff augmentation and financial services 
principally as a result of the development by the company s pro unlimited subsidiary of a business offering web enabled solutions for the procurement  tracking and engagement of contingent labor  the company has determined to begin reporting its results through three operating segments staff augmentation  human capital management services and financial services 
the staff augmentation segment provides information technology it  telecom and other staffing services 
the human capital management services segment provides contingent workforce management services 
the financial services segment provides payroll  funding and back office support services to independent consulting and staffing companies

to facilitate the purchase or exchange by comforce of pik debentures at less than par from willing sellers  permit coi to upstream up to million to pay income tax related to deemed forgiveness of pik debentures

as amended  the ibj credit facility permits the use of up to million in loan proceeds to pay the aggregate repurchase prices of senior notes and pik debentures and costs associated therewith including related tax expenses  not more than million of which may be used to pay the repurchase price of pik debentures and such associated costs

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales of services for the year ended december  were million  an increase of from net sales of services for the year ended december  of million 
the increase in net sales of services is principally attributable to higher sales to customers in the company s human capital management services segment and to telecom customers in the staff augmentation segment  the contribution of sales by gerri g 
since its acquisition in february in the staff augmentation segment and there being more business days in than in  partially offset by a decrease in sales to staff augmentation customers in the engineer related and information technologies sectors 
cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services as compared to cost of services of for the year ended december  the cost of services decreased as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  as a result of the continued strategies undertaken by management to increase margins throughout the company  as well as increases in fees for direct hire placements  which generally have no related costs of services 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase resulted principally from higher payroll and recruiting costs with respect to non billable staff  the expansion of the company s corporate headquarters and investments to expand the infrastructure for the company s human capital management services segment 
the company incurred a charge in the year ended december  of approximately million as a result of the settlement of its litigation with austin iodice and anthony giglio see item  legal proceedings 
operating income for the year ended december  was million as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this increase in operating income for the year ended december  resulted principally from an increase in gross margin  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses and the iodice and giglio litigation settlement as well as an increase in depreciation and amortization 
the company s interest expense for the year ended december  and is attributable to the interest on the heller credit facility  the ibj credit facility  the senior notes and the pik debentures 
the ibj credit facility was entered into in december to repay the heller credit facility and provide the company additional borrowing availability 
these other obligations were incurred in  principally in connection with the funding of business acquisitions 
the company incurred a charge of  for the write off of deferred financing costs in the fourth quarter of for the early termination of the heller credit facility 
the interest expense is higher in due to increased interest rates and borrowings under the credit facilities 
included in other income is a payment for a restricted covenant release of million for the year ended december  this represents a payment made by certain former officers of the company to release them from certain restrictive agreements and non competition covenants 
during the third quarter of  the company repurchased million face value of the senior notes for a purchase price of million 
the net extraordinary gain that was realized by these repurchases was million  which includes the reduction of  of deferred financing costs associated with the repurchases net of tax expense of million 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in this item the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million on income before taxes and extraordinary gain  compared to an income tax provision for the year ended december  of million on a profit before taxes of  the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of and the company s effective tax rate of relates primarily to the nondeductibility of amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets  the nondeductibility of a portion of the interest expense associated with the pik debentures and state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales of services for the year ended december  were million  a decline of from net sales of services for the year ended december  of million 
the decrease in net sales of services is principally attributable to a decrease in sales to it customers and other staffing customers in the company s staff augmentation segment  offset partially by higher sales to customers in the human capital management services segment and telecom customers in the staff augmentation segment 
the company s business with boeing corporation  its largest customer in  was substantially lower in this represented the majority of the decline the company experienced in sales to other staffing customers in the staff augmentation segment 
the company also experienced a decline in it sales in the second half of as a result of the year lockdown  which slowed contract activity  as many customers in the staff augmentation segment limited or delayed it development work until after january  cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services compared to cost of services of for the year ended december  the cost of services decrease as a percentage of net sales for the is a result of the strategies undertaken by management to increase margins  as well as the company s business mix  which reflected growth in the company s sales to telecom customers in the staff augmentation segment and declines in other staffing services in this segment having lower margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this percentage increase was principally attributable to the decline of net sales of services discussed above 
operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this decrease was principally attributable to the reduced net sales of services discussed above coupled with increased depreciation and amortization  partially offset by increased margins 
the company s interest expense for and is attributable to the interest under the heller credit facility  the senior notes and the pik debentures  which obligations were incurred in  principally in connection with the funding of business acquisitions 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million on a profit before taxes of  as compared to an income tax provision for the year ended december  of million on pre tax income of million 
the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective tax rate relates primarily to the nondeductibility of amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets  the nondeductibility of a portion of the interest expense associated with the pik debentures and adjustments to prior period tax estimates 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company pays its billable employees weekly for their services  and remits certain statutory payroll and related taxes as well as other fringe benefits 
invoices are generated to reflect these costs plus the company s markup 
these bills are typically paid within days 
increases in the company s net sales of services  resulting from expansion of existing offices or establishment of new offices  will require additional cash resources 
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the ibj credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
during the year ended december   the company s primary sources of funds to meet working capital needs were from borrowings under the heller credit facility and  later  under the ibj credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities of million were exceeded by cash flows used in operating activities of million and cash flows used in investing activities of million 
the increase in cash flows used in operations over the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to the need to fund growth in accounts receivable as a result of increased revenues and there being more business days in than in as of december   the company had outstanding million in principal amount under the ibj credit facility bearing interest at an average rate of per annum 
in addition  as of december   the company had outstanding million in principal amount of pik debentures bearing interest at a rate of  and million in principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 
the debt service costs associated with the pik debentures may be satisfied through the issuance of new notes 
to date  the company has chosen to issue new pik debentures to pay these costs 
in the third quarter of  the company repurchased million principal amount of senior notes for a purchase price of million  principally from funds made available for this purpose through an amendment of the now retired heller credit facility entered into in the third quarter of as described above under recent developments new credit facility  in december  the company entered into the ibj credit facility to provide greater borrowing availability 
the maximum availability of million was increased to million in january when additional lending institutions requested to join the loan syndicate 
the ibj credit facility was further amended in march to permit the company to use certain borrowed funds to repurchase pik debentures in addition to senior notes  the repurchase of which was previously permitted 
borrowings under the ibj credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a per annum rate equal to either the base commercial lending rate of ibj as announced from time to time but not less than in excess of the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions  plus a margin ranging from if the company s leverage ratio is or less to if the company s leverage ratio is greater than which margin will be fixed at through december   or libor plus a margin ranging from if the company s leverage ratio is or less to if the company s leverage ratio is greater than which margin will be fixed at through december  
the obligations evidenced by the ibj credit facility are collateralized by a pledge of the capital stock of the subsidiaries of the company and by security interests in substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreements evidencing the ibj credit facility contain various financial and other covenants and conditions  including  but not limited to  limitations on paying dividends  engaging in affiliate transactions  making acquisitions and incurring additional indebtedness 
the scheduled maturity date of the ibj credit facility is december in addition  as described under recent developments amendment of indentures  during the fourth quarter of  the company solicited and received approval from the holders of the senior notes to authorize amendments of the indentures designed to address certain of the company s debt strategies  including permitting the company to increase the indebtedness under the credit facility and through securitization vehicles to the greater of i million at any time outstanding  less the aggregate amount thereof repaid with the net proceeds of asset dispositions  or ii of eligible accounts receivable outstanding at any time 
the company continues to examine strategies to reduce its higher interest rate debt and improve its balance sheet 
these strategies include  but are not limited to  repurchasing senior notes or pik debentures through public market purchases or privately negotiated transactions or exchanging senior notes or pik debentures for other securities of the company 
as discussed under recent developments repurchase of senior notes and pik debentures in this item  as part of its strategy  in february and march  the company repurchased million principal amount of senior notes for million and million principal amount of pik debentures for million  the repurchase prices of which were paid from lower interest rate borrowings under the ibj credit facility 
these repurchases are in addition to the company s repurchase during the third quarter of of million principal amount of the senior notes for a purchase price of million  the repurchase price of which was paid from lower interest rate borrowings under the now retired heller credit facility 
the ibj credit facility permits the use of up to million in loan proceeds to pay the aggregate repurchase prices of senior notes and pik debentures and costs associated therewith including related tax expenses  not more than million of which may be used to pay the repurchase price of pik debentures and such associated costs 
in the case of each repurchase to date  the company has incurred tax liabilities for the forgiveness of indebtedness as a result of its repurchase of senior notes or pik debentures for consideration that is less than par 
subsequent to these purchases  management believes the remaining availability under the credit facility is sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet anticipated working capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of the consolidated net assets of the company are assets of coi and all of the net income which has been generated by company through december  is net income attributable to the operations of coi 
accordingly  except for permitted distributions  these assets and net income are restricted as to their use by comforce 
the indenture governing the senior notes imposes restrictions on coi making specified payments  which are referred to as restricted payments  including making distributions or paying dividends referred to as upstreaming funds to comforce 
under the indenture  coi is not permitted to make cash distributions to comforce other than to upstream million annually million annually prior to to pay public company expenses  to upstream up to million to pay income tax related to deemed forgiveness of pik debentures to facilitate the purchase or exchange by comforce of pik debentures at less than par  under certain circumstances in connection with a disposition of assets  to upstream proceeds therefrom to repay the pik debentures  and to upstream funds to the extent coi meets the restricted payments test under the indenture  as described under note b to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in  coi upstreamed million for public company expenses of comforce 
management believes that million annually if coi has funds available for this purpose will be sufficient to pay comforce s annual public company expenses for the foreseeable future 
in the first quarter of  in connection with its repurchase of million principal amount of pik debentures for million  comforce incurred a tax liability related to the forgiveness of indebtedness of approximately million  payable from the million permitted to be upstreamed for this purpose 
the million repurchase cost is deemed to be a restricted payment of coi under the indenture governing the senior notes 
accordingly  upon completion of the repurchase  coi had approximately million remaining available for distribution as permitted restricted payments representing of consolidated net income of coi for the period from january  through december   less million 
through december   interest under the pik debentures is payable  at the option of comforce  in cash or in kind through the issuance of additional pik debentures 
to date  comforce has paid all interest in kind 
beginning with the interest payment due june   comforce will be required to pay interest on the pik debentures in cash 
its ability to do so will be dependent on the ability of coi to upstream funds for this purpose under the restricted payments test 
in addition  comforce s ability to repay the pik debentures at their maturity on december  or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase date will also be dependent on the ability of coi to upstream funds for this purpose under the restricted payments test  unless comforce separately obtains a loan or sells its capital stock or other securities to provide funds for this purpose 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total assets were intangible assets 
these intangible assets substantially represent amounts attributable to goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions 
intangible assets will be amortized over a to year period  resulting in an annual non cash charge of approximately million 
the company is obligated under various agreements to make earn out payments to the sellers of companies acquired by the company and to sellers of franchised businesses repurchased by the company  subject to the sellers meeting specified contractual requirements 
during the year ended december   contingent payments in connection with these acquisitions and repurchases were approximately million in cash 
the maximum amount of the remaining potential earn out payments is approximately million in cash payable through december  the company cannot currently estimate whether it will be obligated to pay the maximum amount  however  the company anticipates that the cash generated by the operations of the acquired companies or franchised businesses will provide all or a substantial part of the capital required to fund the cash portion of the earn out payments 
seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are affected primarily by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its customers businesses 
demand for engineer related staffing services has historically been lower during the year end holidays through january of the following year  showing gradual improvement over the remainder of the year 
although less pronounced than in engineer related services  the demand for telecom and it services is typically lower during the first quarter until customers operating budgets are finalized 
the company believes that the effects of seasonality will be less severe in the future if sales to it  telecom and financial services customers continue to increase as a percentage of the company s consolidated net sales of services 
other matters statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
was issued  making sfas no 
effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   or the company s fiscal based upon review of the provisions of this standard  the company has determined that it will not have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations or have a material effect on its financial statement reporting because the company does not enter into such transactions 
forward looking statements various statements made in this report concerning the manner in which the company intends to conduct its future operations  and potential trends that may impact future results of operations  are forward looking statements 
the company may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors  including  but not limited to  heightened competition for customers as well as for contingent personnel which could potentially require the company to reduce its current fee scales without being able to reduce the personnel costs of its billable employees  due to the company s significant leverage  its greater vulnerability to economic downturns and its potentially diminished ability to obtain additional financing for capital expenditures or for other purposes  if the company is unable to sustain the cash flow necessary to support the significant amortization charges related to goodwill for its acquired businesses  it could be required to write off the impaired assets  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations  or  if coi does not generate sufficient consolidated net income or have other funds available to upstream to comforce under the restricted payments test of the senior notes indenture in order for it to pay cash interest on the pik debentures which is required beginning june  or to repay the pik debentures at their maturity on december  or on any earlier required repayment or repurchase date  then  unless comforce obtains a loan or sells its capital stock or other securities to provide funds for this purpose  the company will default under the indentures governing the pik debentures and the senior notes and under the ibj credit facility 
additional important factors that could cause the company to be unable to realize its plans and objectives are described under risk factors in the registration statement on form s of the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on december  registration no 

the disclosure under risk factors in the registration statement may be accessed through the web site maintained by the securities and exchange commission at www

in addition  the company will provide  without charge  a copy of such risk factors disclosure to each stockholder of the company who requests such information 
requests for copies should be directed to the attention of linda annicelli  vice president of administration at comforce corporation  crossways park drive  po box  woodbury  new york  telephone item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk most of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations 
during  approximately of the company s interest expense was attributable to variable rate loans  all of which were under the heller credit facility which was repaid and terminated in december and ibj credit facility which was entered into in december 
the ibj credit facility provides for borrowing availability of up to million based upon a specified percentage of the company s eligible accounts receivable 
since the interest rates on borrowings under the ibj credit facility are variable  they will be impacted by changes in interest rates generally prevailing in the united states and internationally 
however  management of the company does not believe that any adjustments to the rate under the ibj credit facility are likely to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the immediate future 
assuming an immediate increase in the interest rate under the ibj credit facility  the impact to the company in annualized interest payable would be approximately  since management does not believe that any adjustments to the rate under the ibj credit facility are likely to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  the company has not entered into any swap agreements or other hedging transactions as a means of limiting exposure to interest rate fluctuations
