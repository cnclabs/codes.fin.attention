the decrease in domestic loans and leases was due primarily to the aforementioned divestiture of billion of c i and consumer loans in  new securitizations of approximately billion of credit card receivables and approximately billion of c i loans during the year  and the sale of approximately million of troubled commercial loans in december strong growth in the corporation s domestic lease financing portfolio partially offset the impact of these transactions 
the increase in the corporation s international loan portfolio resulted from new business growth  primarily in brazil 
commercial and industrial loans domestic c i loans decreased billion to billion at december   primarily the result of the divestiture of billion of loans  a billion securitization transaction  the sale of million of troubled commercial loans and a decline in the level of domestic c i loans 
domestic c i borrowers consist primarily of middle market and large corporate customers  and are well diversified as to industry and companies within each industry 
international commercial borrower industry concentrations consist primarily of banking and insurance  transportation  communications and energy production and distribution 
lease financing the corporation is engaged in lease financing on both a domestic and international basis 
domestic lease financing totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  this billion  or  increase was primarily attributable to new business growth 
consumer loans december in millions domestic residential real estate   home equity   credit card   student loans   installment other   total domestic loans   international   total consumer loans   approximately of the domestic consumer loan portfolio at december  consisted of loans secured by residential real estate  including second mortgages  home equity loans and lines of credit 
the corporation manages the risk associated with most types of consumer loans by utilizing uniform credit standards when extending credit  together with systems that streamline the process of monitoring delinquencies 
domestic residential real estate loans  secured by one to four family properties  decreased billion  or  to billion at december  this decline was primarily the result of the divestiture of billion of such loans 
domestic credit card loans decreased million to billion at december  the decrease was mainly the result of billion of new securitizations during  offset by growth in the owned portfolio and activity related to prior year securitizations 
the aggregate decreases in the remaining consumer loan categories were directly attributable to divestitures of billion  as well as student loan sales during the period 
cross border outstandings in accordance with federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines  cross border outstandings are amounts payable to the corporation by residents of foreign countries  regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated  and local country claims in excess of local country obligations 
at december  and  total cross border outstandings were approximately billion  which included billion of cross border outstandings to latin america 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations 
the corporation manages its cross border outstandings using country exposure limits established by the country exposure committee 
the following table details  by country  the corporation s approximate cross border outstandings that individually amounted to or more of its consolidated total assets at december   and there were no countries in which cross border outstandings totaled between

during  the argentine economy began to recover slowly from the recession that it experienced in political discussions regarding a plan to improve the economy have continued 
this situation has led to a new letter of intent with the international monetary fund 
the related agreement includes reforms of the country s tax and pension systems and reductions in state provinces fiscal deficits 
these reforms are aimed at reducing argentina s public deficit and improving the country s overall economic performance 
to date  argentine cross border outstandings and securities portfolios have not been significantly impacted by the economic and political situation described above 
in management s judgment  the argentine situation has not significantly impacted other latin american countries where the corporation has operations 
the corporation will continue to closely monitor the argentine economic and political situation and its potential impact on argentine and other latin american operations 
however  it is not possible to predict what effect  if any  the economic and political events in argentina will ultimately have on that country s economic growth or on the corporation s operations in argentina or in other latin american countries

such assets are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
reserve for credit losses the reserve for credit losses represents the amount available for credit losses inherent in the corporation s loan and lease portfolios 
loans are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible  after giving consideration to factors such as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  as well as general and industry economic conditions 
the corporation performs periodic  systematic reviews of its portfolios to identify these inherent losses  and to assess the overall probability of collection of these portfolios 
these reviews result in the identification and quantification of loss factors  which are used in determining the amount of the reserve for credit losses 
in addition  the corporation periodically evaluates prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  including emerging markets risks and cross border outstandings  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio and other pertinent factors 
portions of the reserve for credit losses are allocated to cover the estimated losses inherent in each loan and lease category based on the results of this detailed review process 
commercial loans and leases are individually reviewed and assigned a credit risk rating from low risk of loss to high risk of loss 
this process includes the review of loans with a credit risk rating of and above and a principal balance greater than  to determine the need for a specific loan loss allocation 
additionally  derived or calculated loan loss allocations are provided for credit risk rated loans not specifically allocated 
estimated loss factors are provided for loans with a credit risk rating of to based on their specific credit risk rating classification 
the combination of these analyses is the basis for the determination of the commercial loan and lease portions of the reserve for credit losses 
consumer loans  which include credit cards  residential mortgages  home equity loans lines  direct indirect loans  consumer finance and international consumer loans  are generally evaluated as a group based on product type 
the determination of the consumer loan portion of the reserve for credit losses is based on one year of forecasted net credit losses 
this forecast is determined using several modeling tools  including a delinquency roll rate model  a vintage model and a regression model 
small business loans are analyzed in a similar manner based on delinquency migration 
this analysis includes two years of forecasted net credit losses 
the results of the analyses are reviewed and discussed by the corporation s loss reserve management committee  the respective lines of business and the collections group 
a sovereign risk analysis  which assesses the cross border risk of credit loss  is performed as part of the corporation s review of its international commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
testing of forecasted net credit losses and specific allocations of the reserve are performed on a quarterly basis 
adjustments to reserve allocations for specific segments of the loan and lease portfolio may be made as a result of this testing  based on the accuracy of forecasted net credit losses and other credit or policy related issues 
the process used by the corporation to determine the appropriate overall reserve for credit losses is based on this analysis  taking into consideration management s judgment 
reserve methodology is reviewed on a periodic basis and modified as appropriate 
based on this analysis  including the aforementioned assumptions  the corporation believes that the reserve for credit losses is adequate as of december  an integral component of the corporation s risk management process is to ensure the proper allocation of the reserve for credit losses based upon an analysis of risk characteristics  demonstrated losses  loan segmentations  and other factors 
the unallocated component of the reserve for credit losses represents management s view that  given the complexities of the loan portfolio  there are estimable losses that have been incurred within the portfolio but not yet specifically identified 
this unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions utilized in the allocated reserve calculation

the corporation s reserve for credit losses decreased million  or  from december   to billion at december  this decline was primarily the result of aggregate reductions of reserves in connection with divestitures and the sale of troubled commercial loans  offset by the excess of the provision for credit losses over net charge offs

at december  asset and liability management the goal of asset and liability management is the prudent control of market risk  liquidity risk and use of capital 
asset and liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the corporation s board of directors the board 
the board delegates responsibility for asset and liability management to the corporation s asset  liability and capital committee alcco 
alcco sets strategic directives that guide the day to day market risk management activities of the corporation  and also reviews and approves all major market risk  liquidity risk and capital management programs 
market risk management market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income and capital to variations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
the corporation is exposed to market risk both in its balance sheet management activities and in its trading activities 
the corporation s market risk management process for these activities applies to both balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
balance sheet management us dollar denominated risk us dollar denominated assets and liabilities comprise the majority of the corporation s balance sheet 
interest rate risk  including mortgage prepayment risk  is by far the most significant non trading market risk to which the us dollar denominated positions are exposed 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of income or financial condition to variations in interest rates and arises directly from the corporation s core banking activities lending  deposit gathering and loan servicing 
the interest rate risk exposure of us dollar denominated assets and liabilities results almost entirely from domestic operations 
such exposure of us dollar denominated assets and liabilities in the corporation s overseas operations is not significant 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines approved by alcco 
these limits and guidelines reflect the corporation s tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term time horizons 
the major source of the corporation s non trading interest rate risk is the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between the corporation s core banking assets and liabilities loans and deposits 
this difference  or mismatch  poses a risk to net interest income 
most significantly  the corporation s core banking assets and liabilities are mismatched with respect to repricing frequency  maturity and or index 
most of the corporation s commercial loans  for example  reprice rapidly in response to changes in short term interest rates eg  libor and prime rate 
in contrast  many of the corporation s consumer deposits reprice slowly  if at all  in response to changes in market interest rates 
as a result  the core bank is asset sensitive 
the corporation controls interest rate risk by identifying  quantifying and hedging its exposures 
the corporation identifies and quantifies its interest rate exposures using sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as simpler gap analyses  reflecting the known or assumed maturity  repricing  and other cash flow characteristics of the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the corporation hedges the interest rate risk inherent in its core banking operations using both on balance sheet instruments  mainly fixed rate portfolio securities  and a variety of off balance sheet instruments 
the most frequently used off balance sheet instruments are interest rate swaps and options eg  interest rate caps and floors 
when appropriate  forward rate agreements  options on swaps  and exchange traded futures and options are also used 
at december   interest rate swaps totaling approximately billion notional amount were being used to manage risk to net interest income 
a second major source of non trading interest rate risk is the sensitivity of msrs to prepayments 
a mortgage borrower has the option to prepay a mortgage loan at any time  without penalty 
as a result  the corporation s mortgage based assets not only msrs but also mortgage loans and securities are subject to prepayment risk 
this risk tends to increase when interest rates fall due to the benefits of refinancing 
since msrs represent the right to service mortgage loans  a decline in interest rates and an actual or probable increase in mortgage prepayments shorten the expected life of the msr asset and reduce the expected amount of servicing fees to be received and  therefore  the economic value of the msrs 
the expected income from and  therefore  the economic value of msrs is sensitive to movements in interest rates due to this sensitivity to mortgage prepayments 
to mitigate the risk of declining long term interest rates  increased mortgage prepayments and the potential impairment of msrs  the corporation uses a variety of risk management instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps and floors tied to constant maturity yields on long term eg  year treasury notes and swaps  options on swaps  exchange traded options on treasury bond and note futures contracts  and swaps linked to mortgage assets such as principal only po securities 
these instruments gain value as interest rates decline  mitigating the impairment of msrs 
at december   the corporation had approximately billion notional amount of outstanding derivatives being used to manage risk to the msrs valuation 
complicating management s efforts to control non trading exposure to interest rate risk is the fundamental uncertainty of the maturity  repricing  and or runoff characteristics of some of the corporation s core banking assets and liabilities 
this uncertainty often reflects options embedded in these financial instruments 
the most important embedded options are contained in consumer deposits and loans 
for example  many of the corporation s interest bearing retail deposit products eg  interest checking  savings and money market deposits have no contractual maturity 
customers have the right to withdraw funds from these deposit accounts freely 
deposit balances may therefore run off unexpectedly due to changes in competitive or market conditions 
to forestall such runoff  rates on interest bearing deposits may have to be increased more or reduced less than expected 
such repricing may not be highly correlated with the repricing of prime rate based or libor based loans 
finally  balances that leave the banking franchise may have to be replaced with other more expensive retail or wholesale deposits 
given the uncertainties surrounding deposit runoff and repricing  the interest rate sensitivity of core bank liabilities cannot be determined precisely 
to cope with such uncertainties  management has developed a number of assumptions 
depending on the product or behavior in question  each assumption will reflect some combination of market data  research analysis and business judgment 
for example  assumptions for mortgage prepayments are derived from third party prepayment estimates for comparable mortgage loans 
assumptions for noncontractual deposits are based on a historical analysis of repricing and runoff trends  heavily weighted to the recent past  modified by business judgment concerning prospective competitive market influences 
to measure the sensitivity of its income to changes in interest rates  the corporation uses a variety of methods  including simulation and valuation analyses 
simulation analysis involves dynamically modeling interest income and expense from the corporation s on balance sheet and off balance sheet positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
the corporation uses simulation analysis primarily to measure the sensitivity of net interest income over relatively short eg  less than year time horizons 
key assumptions in these simulation analyses and in the valuation analyses discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the growth or shrinkage of product balances and the behavior of the corporation s deposit and loan customers 
as indicated above  the most material assumptions relate to the prepayment of mortgage assets  as well as the repricing and or runoff of noncontractual deposits 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  management uses simulation analysis to project earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
some scenarios reflect reasonable or most likely economic forecasts 
other scenarios are deliberately extreme  including immediate interest rate shocks  gradual interest rate ramps  spread narrowings widenings  and yield curve twists 
usually  each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario 
but in some analyses  assumptions are deliberately manipulated to test the corporation s exposure to assumption risk 
the corporation s board approved limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates in the base forecast scenario were to shift immediately up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the subsequent months should decline by less than 
the base scenario as of december   intended to reflect current market consensus  envisioned basis points of easing in federal reserve board interest rate policy 
the limit relates to the impact of an immediate increase or decrease in forecasted interest rates relative to this base scenario 
the corporation was in compliance with the limit at december  and the following table reflects the estimated exposure of the corporation s net interest income for the next months due to an immediate shift in forecasted interest rates 
management believes that these estimates reflect a complete and reasonable representation of the corporation s balance sheet 
it should be emphasized  however  that the estimated exposures set forth below are dependent on material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
estimated exposure to rate change net interest income basis points in millions as indicated  an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would tend to reduce net interest income but by an amount that is well within corporate limits 
an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would tend to enhance net interest income 
thus  the balance sheet position as of december  is modestly liability sensitive 
while an immediate and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  management believes that the exposure of the corporation s net interest income to gradual and modest changes in interest rates is relatively insignificant 
estimated net interest income exposures at december  differ from those at year end the rising rate scenario shows greater exposure  the declining rate scenario now shows a benefit 
these changes are a direct result of interest rate risk management strategy 
as the federal reserve board continued to tighten monetary policy in the first half of and as the prospect of a subsequent economic slowdown increased  the corporation added interest rate swaps  as well as fixed rate securities  to reduce the exposure of net interest income as well as economic value to any possible future decline in interest rates 
the corporation also performs valuation analysis  which involves projecting future cash flows from the corporation s current assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions over a very long term horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
the corporation s economic value of equity eve is the estimated net present value of these discounted cash flows 
valuation analysis provides a somewhat more comprehensive measure than simulation analysis  not only because valuation analysis incorporates a longer time horizon  but also because it includes certain interest rate sensitive components of noninterest income  specifically mortgage banking revenue 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates 
the corporation uses the sensitivity of eve primarily to measure the exposure of earnings and equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long eg  greater than year time horizon 
the corporation s board approved limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates in the base forecast scenario were to shift immediately up or down basis points  the estimated eve should decline by less than 
the corporation was in compliance with this limit at december  and the following table reflects the corporation s estimated eve exposures assuming an immediate shift in interest rates 
exposures are reported for shifts of basis points as well as basis points because the sensitivity of eve to changes in interest rates can be very nonlinear 
management believes that these estimates reflect a complete and reasonable representation of the corporation s balance sheet but  again  it should be emphasized that the estimated exposures are dependent on material assumptions 
estimated exposure to rate change economic value basis points in millions as indicated  an immediate basis point change in interest rates in either direction would reduce eve  but by an amount that is well within corporate limits 
these exposures have two different sources an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would reduce net interest income  an immediate basis point decrease would reduce the value of msrs 
again  while an immediate and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact  due partly to anticipated adjustments in msr hedges 
estimated eve exposures at december  are more symmetrical than at year end this change  similar to the change in net interest income exposure  is a direct result of interest rate risk management strategy in the first half of  the corporation added interest rate swaps and fixed rate securities  reducing the exposure of economic value to a decline in interest rates 
it should be emphasized that valuation analysis focuses on the long term economic value of the corporation s future cash flows 
for some financial instruments  the adverse impact of current movements in interest rates on expected future cash flows must be recognized immediately 
for example  if interest rates decline and the related hedge is not effective  thereby reducing estimated future fee income from msrs such that the estimated economic value of the msrs falls below its book value  an immediate impairment charge is required 
in contrast  for other financial instruments  such as fixed rate investment securities  the beneficial impact of a decline in interest rates on future income is unrecognized unless the instruments are sold 
as a result of such accounting requirements  a portion of the eve exposure attributable to msrs could materially impact earnings within the next months under certain extreme scenarios involving changes in market spreads  a decline in implied option volatilities  and or a greater than anticipated increase in prepayments 
off balance sheet interest rate instruments used to manage net interest income are designated as hedges of specific assets and liabilities 
accrual accounting is applied to these hedges  and the income or expense is recorded in the same category as that of the related balance sheet item 
the periodic net settlement of the interest rate risk management instruments is recorded as an adjustment to net interest income 
as of december   the corporation had net deferred income of million relating to terminated interest rate swap contracts  which will be amortized over the remaining life of the underlying terminated interest rate contracts of approximately years 
the interest rate instruments used to manage potential impairment of msrs are designated as hedges of the msrs 
changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the msrs and related hedges 
during  net hedge gains of million were deferred and recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the msrs and related hedges 
at december   the carrying value and fair value of the corporation s msrs were approximately billion 
in connection with the corporation s management of its msr hedge program  the corporation terminated in notional amounts billion of interest rate floor and option on swap agreements and billion of call options purchased  and added billion and billion of interest rate floor and option on swap agreements and call options purchased  respectively  during additionally  the corporation added billion of interest rate cap and cap corridors and billion of interest rate swap contracts  and terminated billion and billion  respectively  of these instruments during these risk management activities do not completely eliminate interest rate risk in the msrs 
the msr hedges utilized were indexed to treasury rates  swap rates and mortgage rates 
treasury rates and swap rates may not move in tandem with mortgage interest rates 
in addition  as mortgage interest rates change  actual prepayments may not respond exactly as anticipated 
other pricing factors  such as the implied volatility of market yields  may affect the value of the option hedges without similarly impacting the msrs 
therefore  the corporation s hedging activity may not be sufficient to eliminate prepayment and other market risk completely in all interest rate scenarios 
the corporation adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as of january  for additional information on the accounting requirements of this new standard  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report 
balance sheet management non us dollar denominated risk the corporation s non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks 
the majority of the non us dollar denominated interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure stems from the corporation s operations in latin america  primarily argentina and brazil 
at december   the corporation s exposure to non trading interest rate risk in its latin american operations was not significant 
exposure to non trading foreign exchange rate risk in latin american operations is managed using a var methodology  which is discussed in the trading activities section of this discussion and analysis

trading activities the corporation s trading activities create exposure to price risk  or the risk of loss of income arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instrument trading portfolios 
this exposure arises in the normal course of the corporation s business as a financial intermediary 
the corporation enters into interest rate  currency exchange and precious metals contracts primarily to satisfy the investment and risk management needs of its customers 
equity positions result mainly from the corporation s market making and underwriting activities 
in addition  the corporation takes certain proprietary trading positions  including positions in high yield and emerging markets fixed income securities  local currency debt and equity securities  and related derivative instruments 
the corporation expects these proprietary trading positions to benefit from short term movements in the prices of securities and from perceived inefficiencies among the prices of various securities issued by the same country or entity 
domestic fixed income trading activities also include position taking in us treasury and us government agency securities 
the corporation s price risk management process identifies  measures  monitors and controls the effects of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
management seeks to limit the volatility of earnings and protect economic value to its shareholders and customers 
alcco delegates oversight responsibility for managing price risk associated with trading activities to the market risk committee mrc 
the mrc allocates the overall price risk limits set by alcco to the corporation s trading activities 
as part of the corporation s price risk control process  the mrc establishes formal limits consistent with the policies  standards and procedures that define responsibility for risk taking and independent oversight 
some controls reflect outright prohibitions on certain activities or instruments 
many of these controls involve explicit limits related to various risk measures  as appropriate for each individual line of business 
the corporation s risk monitoring process ensures timely review of all risk positions 
market risk policies and limits are reviewed by alcco and the mrc at least annually  or more often if warranted by current market  economic or business conditions 
line of business management has primary responsibility for the actual market risk profile  ensuring the appropriate measurement  monitoring and control of exposures within approved policies and limits 
through monthly meetings  senior management oversees the worldwide market risks arising from the corporation s trading activities 
the corporation evaluates the overall profitability of its trading positions by measuring the daily change in the mark to market value of these portfolios  including other related revenues 
the corporation s price risk management process is intended to limit the potential of large negative daily earnings results 
the following histogram presents the distribution of aggregate daily trading related revenues  in millions of dollars  that resulted from the corporation s combined trading activities during 
graphic omitted bar chart representation of daily trading related revenues through december  revenues number of days in millions above total days trading related revenues include trading profits and commissions  foreign exchange revenue and market making revenue  which are all components of capital markets revenue  as well as net interest income from these trading positions 
through december   daily trading related revenues ranged from a loss of million to a profit of million 
market conditions throughout posed ongoing challenges to the corporation s trading businesses and risk management processes 
at times  market volatility increased dramatically in a variety of sectors  including domestic equities  currency exchange and emerging markets and high yield securities 
as shown in the chart above  the corporation s risk management discipline effectively controlled the size and extent of negative trading results 
risk measurement processes represent an important pillar of the corporation s risk management framework 
to measure the overall price risk inherent in its trading activities  the corporation uses a value at risk var methodology  based on industry standard risk measurement techniques 
the system draws on historical and current market data to estimate potential market volatility  and measures the risk to earnings at a confidence level  which means that the corporation expects daily results to exceed the potential loss as calculated by var only occasionally ie  no more than one time for at least trading days 
the var methodology includes holding periods for each position based upon an assessment of relative trading market liquidity for each instrument  and a conservative view of cross product correlations that does not reflect the full diversification benefits of positions taken across different trading businesses 
during  the corporation continued to enhance its processes for price risk measurement and monitoring against approved limits 
the corporation s aggregate var averaged million daily during  a slight increase from the million reported for at december  total var usage measured million 
at no time during the year did the corporation s daily var measure exceed the mrc s approved limit 
the table below presents the corporation s exposure with respect to its combined trading portfolios value at risk var in millions average high low year ended december  year ended december  during  most of the price risk in the corporation s trading activities arose from interest rate risk 
such risk  which included directional and spread components  averaged million  or of aggregate var 
interest rate risk arises primarily from trading activity in various domestic fixed income markets  the argentine and brazilian sovereign and high end corporate bond markets  and some exposure to fixed income markets in the asia pacific region 
the contribution to the corporation s var from equity trading activities through the year ended december  increased somewhat  to an average of million  or of aggregate var 
the activities that generate most of these risks include the corporation s large nyse specialist firm  nasdaq market making  equity trading and a convertible bond trading and underwriting business 
risks from foreign exchange trading activities through the year ended december  declined to an average of million  or of aggregate var 
the majority of these risks arise from the corporation s argentine and brazilian operations 
the following table presents the corporation s aggregate average var by risk type for the periods presented 
average var for commodity risk remained insignificant for the periods shown 
var by risk type in millions average average interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange risk aggregate price risk the corporation s independent market risk management function routinely validates the corporation s measurement framework by conducting backtests  which compare the actual daily trading related results against the estimated var with a one day holding period 
the following graph presents this comparison for the months ended december  in no instance did a daily aggregate trading loss exceed the one day aggregate var measure associated with that date  which compares very favorably with the corporation s statistical expectation that approximately three such breaches will occur over a year 

graphic omitted line graph representation of daily trading related revenues and var measure with a one day holding period for the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   the daily trading related revenues ranged from a loss of million to a profit of million 
over the same time period  var with a one day holding period ranged from million to million 
in addition to the var framework  the corporation employs other risk measurement tools to evaluate and control price risk 
these tools include cumulative loss limits and overall portfolio size limits  as well as regular stress tests and scenario analyses 
stress testing involves modifying the var model s assumptions to reflect rare events that have the potential for high impact 
scenario analyses involve calculating the impact of a pre determined set of events  irrespective of their statistical likelihood of occurrence 
such analyses may reflect historically observed market changes  incorporate specific scenarios that reflect some judgement about potential market conditions or identify the kind of scenario that would cause the most harm to existing positions 
while the var framework and the additional risk measurement tools effectively ensure exposures remain within the corporation s expressed tolerance for price risk  they do not guarantee the avoidance of trading losses during periods of extreme volatility 
when deemed appropriate  the corporation will take positions in certain currencies with the intention of taking advantage of expected movements in currency and interest rates 
the corporation takes currency positions by funding local currency assets with dollars or by funding dollar assets with local currency liabilities 
currency positions expose the corporation to gains or losses that depend on the relationship between currency price movements and interest rate differentials 
these positions are subject to limits established by alcco 
the majority of the corporation s foreign exchange risk is generated by its operations in argentina and brazil  and is managed within the overall currency positions 
the following table represents the corporation s currency positions in argentina and brazil for and currency positions december in millions year end average year end average argentina a brazil b a positions represent local currency assets funded by us dollars for both periods presented 
b positions and year end position represent local currency assets funded by us dollars  average position represents us dollar assets funded by local currency liabilities 
to date  the corporation s currency positions have been liquid in nature  and management has been able to close and re open these positions as necessary 
liquidity risk management the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the ability of the corporation and its subsidiaries to meet their financial obligations 
these obligations are the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
liquidity is achieved by the maintenance of a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell marketable securities  committed lines of credit and access to capital markets 
liquidity may also be enhanced through the securitization of commercial and consumer receivables 
liquidity is measured and monitored daily  allowing management to better understand and react to balance sheet trends 
alcco is responsible for implementing the board s policies and guidelines governing liquidity 
us dollar liquidity management is centralized in boston  with overseas operations managing their own local currency liquidity requirements 
the primary sources of liquidity for the parent company are interest and dividends from subsidiaries  committed lines of credit and access to the money and capital markets 
dividends from banking subsidiaries are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and retained earnings 
the corporation s subsidiaries rely on cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings  short term high quality liquid assets  and  in the case of non banking subsidiaries  funds from the parent company 
liquidity at the bank level is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  core deposits and wholesale funds 
diversification of liquidity sources by maturity  market  product and funds provider are mandated through alcco guidelines 
management also maintains a detailed contingency liquidity plan designed to respond to an overall decline in the condition of the banking industry or a problem specific to the corporation 
the strength of the corporation s liquidity position is its base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources in the capital markets  as well as from direct customer contacts 
wholesale funding sources include large certificates of deposit  foreign branch deposits  federal funds  collateralized borrowings and a billion bank note program 
greater funding diversification was achieved in through the corporation s global issuance of billion of senior notes and fnb s issuance of million of euro notes under a billion euro medium term note program 
another important source of bank funding is the securitization market 
during  approximately billion of c i loans and billion of credit card receivables were securitized 
at december   the corporation s parent company had commercial paper outstanding of billion  compared with billion at december  the corporation s parent company had excess funds at december  of billion compared to billion at december  the corporation has backup lines of credit totaling billion to ensure funding is not interrupted if commercial paper is not available 
at december  and  the corporation had no outstanding balances under these lines of credit 
the parent company had billion available for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or trust preferred securities  senior or subordinated securities and other debt securities at december  under an effective shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec

management believes the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities to customers and debt holders 
capital management a financial institution s capital serves to support asset growth and provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
the corporation strives to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with its risk profile  on which an attractive return to stockholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while serving depositors  creditors and regulatory needs 
in determining optimal capital levels  the corporation also considers the capital levels of its peers and the evaluations of the major rating agencies that assign ratings to the corporation s public debt 
common equity represents the stockholders investment in the corporation 
in addition to common equity  regulatory capital includes  within certain limits  preferred stock  trust preferred securities  subordinated debt  and the reserve for credit losses 
in blending the requirements of each of these constituencies  the corporation has established target capital ranges that it believes will provide for management flexibility and the deployment of capital in an optimally efficient and profitable manner 
these targets are reviewed periodically relative to the corporation s risk profile and prevailing economic conditions 
the corporation strives to maintain regulatory capital at approximately 
above the minimum regulatory requirements for a well capitalized institution  as defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
to be categorized as well capitalized  the corporation and its banking subsidiaries must maintain a risk based total capital ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage ratio of at least  and not be subject to a written agreement  order or capital directive with any of its regulators 
capital ratios december risk adjusted assets in millions   tier risk based capital minimum total risk based capital minimum leverage minimum common equity to assets total equity to assets tangible common equity to assets tangible common equity to managed assets tangible total equity to assets at december   the corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios  and satisfied the requirements of the well capitalized category established by fdicia 
the corporation s risk based capital ratios increased compared with december   reflecting the impact of the gain on branch divestitures  the related reduction in asset levels and the strong internal generation of capital 
prior year risk based capital ratios were impacted by the merger and restructuring related charges and other costs recorded in excess capital  defined as common equity above the capital target  is available for core business investments and acquisitions 
during the first quarter of  the corporation purchased million outstanding shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
as registered brokers dealers and member firms of the nyse  certain subsidiaries of the corporation are subject to rules of both the sec and the nyse 
these rules require members to maintain minimum levels of net capital  as defined  and may restrict a member from expanding its business and declaring dividends as its net capital approaches specified levels 
at december   these subsidiaries had aggregate net capital of approximately million  which exceeded aggregate minimum net capital requirements by approximately million 
comparison of and the corporation s net income for  inclusive of the aforementioned merger and restructuring related charges and other costs  was billion  or per diluted share  compared with billion  or per diluted share  in on the same basis 
roa and roe were and  respectively  for compared with and  respectively  for net interest income on an fte basis totaled billion in  compared with billion in  the result of strong loan growth in the domestic commercial and lease financing portfolios  primarily from the sanwa business credit sanwa acquisition 
net interest margin for was  compared with in the decrease in net interest margin was primarily attributable to a higher level of low yielding earning assets necessary to support an expanding investment banking operation  as well as an increased reliance on wholesale funding 
the provision for credit losses was million in compared with million in  with the increase due principally to the acquisition of sanwa  as well as higher credit losses in the domestic commercial loan portfolio compared to noninterest income increased billion to billion in increases were noted in nearly all core revenue categories including capital markets  investment services  credit cards and processing related revenues 
strong growth was noted over as a result of acquisitions  as well as growth within existing and acquired businesses 
noninterest expense totaled billion in  compared with billion in this increase was driven primarily by the acquisitions of robertson stephens in august and sanwa in february  growth in many of the corporation s businesses  a rise in compensation expense due to incentive payments related to higher revenue levels  and the aforementioned merger and restructuring related charges and other costs 
total loans at december  were billion  compared with billion at december  the increase was attributable to the acquisition of sanwa and strong loan growth in the domestic commercial loan and lease financing portfolios  offset  in part  by securitization activity of billion 
total deposits decreased billion to billion at december  the decrease was due principally to declines of billion in domestic regular savings and now deposits  billion in domestic time deposits and million in international deposits  partially offset by a billion increase in domestic money market deposits 
long term debt increased billion to billion as a result of the funding of both acquisitions and balance sheet growth 
recent accounting developments sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 establishes comprehensive accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the standard requires that all derivative instruments be recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
however  the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge 
if the derivative instrument does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value are reported in earnings when they occur 
if the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge  the accounting treatment varies based on the type of risk being hedged 
the corporation adopted sfas no 
as of january  the related transition adjustments resulted in an after tax increase to stockholders equity of approximately million  and an after tax increase of approximately million to net income 
the ultimate impact of the standard on the corporation s results of operations will depend on a variety of factors  including interest rates and other market conditions  as well as future interpretive guidance from the financial accounting standards board  which continues to address implementation issues 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
 which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  provides accounting and reporting standards for securitizations and other transfers of assets 
the standard is based on the application of a financial components approach that focuses on control  and provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
the standard requires disclosure of information about securitized assets  including principal outstanding of securitized and other managed assets  accounting policies  key assumptions related to the determination of the fair value of retained interests  delinquencies and credit losses 
the accounting requirements of the standard are effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march   and must be applied prospectively 
the disclosures related to securitization transactions are required for fiscal years ending after december   and comparative disclosures for prior periods are not required 
the corporation has provided the required disclosures as of december  in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this report  and does not expect the impact of the accounting requirements of the standard to be material to its financial position or results of operations in future periods
