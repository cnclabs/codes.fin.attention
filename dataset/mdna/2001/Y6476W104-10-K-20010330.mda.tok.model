general overview omi is one of the largest publicly traded providers of energy transportation services in the world 
its ships carry crude oil and refined petroleum products in international markets for major oil companies 
the company is the successor to universal bulk carriers  inc  which was a wholly owned subsidiary of omi corp 
old omi until june  at which date the company was separated from old omi renamed marine transport corporation through a tax free distribution distribution of one share of the company s common stock for each share of old omi common stock 
the distribution separated old omi into two publicly owned companies 
the company trades under the symbol omm on the new york stock exchange 
for the year ended december   net income was million or basic eps diluted eps compared to the net loss of million or basic diluted loss per share including per share for an extraordinary loss and per share income from the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  included million in net losses from the disposals and write downs of vessels and investments offset partially by gains from the early termination of two time chartered vessels 
included in the year ended december  net loss of million were losses aggregating million  including the provision for loss on lease obligations  losses from the write down and disposal of vessels  losses on the write down and disposal of three joint venture investments and the extraordinary loss relating to the write off of deferred finance fees 
such losses were partially offset by income from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
omi s fleet omi s objective is to operate a high quality  well maintained  modern fleet of vessels that are concentrated in selected markets 
omi began a fleet renewal program in the first newbuildings were delivered in  which is still in progress with the most recent newbuilding deliveries in and in addition  omi has acquired two suezmax construction contracts from another owner in by purchasing such contracts omi has opted to target for earlier delivery dates versus the current delivery dates from various yards ranging up to approximately three years 
omi has also recently contracted for three handymax newbuildings  and has available options to purchase two more handymax vessels one of the options was granted march 
the company s fleet currently consists of vessels as follows number deadweight ton of vessels dwt crude oil fleet built suezmax vessels  dwt suezmax vessel chartered in  dwt s built panamax vessels  dwt built ulcc  dwt total product carrier clean fleet built handymax product carriers  dwt built handysize product carriers  dwt built handysize product carriers  dwt total includes one suezmax newbuilding  which was delivered january includes three product carriers delivered in february and march recent activities acquisitions omi has recently acquired or agreed to acquire the following in during march  omi agreed to acquire one  dwt product carrier built in for million 
the company agreed to issue  shares of common stock at per share as partial payment for the vessel 
the company is obligated to pay additional cash representing the difference between and the average closing prices for trading days following registration of the shares if less than 
if the price equals or exceeds per share for days during the period ten of which must be consecutive  the obligation terminates 
the maximum payment is limited to million 
in february and march  omi acquired two and one built product carriers from osprey maritime limited for an aggregate contract price of million 
omi issued  shares of common stock to osprey during february and march at per share as partial payment for the vessels and financed the balance of the purchase 
in january  omi took delivery of a new suezmax tanker from a shipbuilder  the contract for which was acquired from another owner during the fourth quarter of for an approximate cost of million 
in january  omi agreed to acquire two shipbuilding contracts for suezmax vessels for an aggregate of million  the vessels are to be delivered september and october the company issued  shares of common stock at per share for partial payment for these contracts during february the company is obligated to pay additional cash representing the difference between and the average closing prices for days following registration of the shares if less than 
if the closing price equals or exceeds for trading days during the period ten of which must be consecutive  the obligation terminates 
the maximum payment is million 
in november  omi contracted to purchase a  dwt product tanker at an approximate cost of million to be delivered in february in the first quarter of  omi exercised two of its four options one additional option was negotiated for in march to purchase two more  dwt product carriers at an approximate aggregate cost of million to be delivered in march and the first half of redelivery of vessels the owner of omi s two time chartered suezmax tankers gave notice of early termination as permitted under the charters  one vessel was redelivered in january and the other vessel was redelivered during march as stated in the charter hire agreements  omi is to receive million for the early termination upon redelivery of each vessel 
this fee will be included in gain on disposal of assets in the first quarter of the early termination of these charters resulted in certain accounting adjustments reflected in the fourth quarter results and upon redelivery will also result in recognition of contractual early termination payments due to omi in the first half of gains recognized upon notice of early termination included in the fourth quarter results  were due to the accelerated amortization of the deferred gain on the sale leaseback of one vessel  which was previously owned by omi  and acceleration of the provision for loss on lease obligation that was being amortized over the original lease term for the other vessel 
investments during  omi invested in two business to business internet companies  marineprovider asa  a norwegian based company  which will provide services such as electronic acquisition of bunker and other supplies for ships  and sealogistics ltd  which offered on line chartering and other services to shipowners and charterers 
in the first quarter  sealogistic s assets have been sold to levelseas holdings ltd 
levelseas  a competitor for shares in levelseas 
omi now owns of levelseas 
market alliances omi has concentrated on two selected markets  suezmax tankers and handysize product carriers 
omi s concentrations in specific vessel categories reflects management s belief in the benefits of consolidation 
omi has been at the forefront of this consolidation process with participations in partnerships and pooling arrangements in recent years 
tanker consolidation benefits customers and owners by providing better scheduling opportunities through substitution and providing opportunities to obtain contracts for large volume movements  which enhance the potential to increase vessel utilization 
large and concentrated fleets create economies of scale to spread the overhead and operating costs 
the company can achieve higher quality tanker operations by enhanced operating expertise and efficiency from concentration in certain vessel classes 
omi believes that large customers prefer to deal with a limited number of large shipping companies with fleets that they have pre vetted for quality  rather than smaller shipping companies characteristic of the fragmented international tanker market 
since may alliance chartering llc  a limited liability company which is jointly owned with frontline ltd  a major international shipping company has handled the chartering of omi s and frontline ltd 
s suezmaxes 
alliance s current fleet stands at approximately vessels 
in march the company agreed with osprey maritime limited  a major international shipping company based in singapore  to consolidate their product tanker operations  and in may international product carriers limited ipc was established in bermuda to commercially operate the product carriers of its parents 
omi s vessels operating in this venture generated revenue aggregating percent of omi s consolidated revenue 
osprey  following a change in control in the first quarter of  has sold all of its product tankers in the pool including three to omi and the parties agreed to disband ipc 
the vessels owned by omi will be operated by the company 
the panamax vessels earned high rates in operating in the star tankers inc pool 
revenues of million earned from this pool in aggregated approximately percent of omi s consolidated revenue in the vessels are older  two are years old and the third is years old 
while the company would typically dispose of single hull vessels of this age  the market value of these vessels does not reflect the recent substantial cash flow from the vessels 
market overview suezmax tanker overview the tanker market fundamentals improved substantially throughout and  in the fourth quarter  tce freight rates reached levels not seen since the early s 
this was the result of increasing world oil demand at a time of very low inventory levels  and increased crude oil seaborne volumes as opec revised its oil production quota upward four times by an aggregate total of million barrels per day b d 
at the same time  the growth of the world tanker fleet was moderate as high tanker scrapping activity  especially in the first half of  offset tanker newbuilding deliveries 
in addition  charterers reduced their acceptance of old tankers in favor of modern tonnage  due to environmental concerns stemming from the erika accident at the end of tce rates for suezmax tankers have softened early in but remain above the tce level prevailing at the same time last year 
this is due to a reduction of iraqi oil exports as a result of an oil pricing dispute with the united nations un though iraq is expected to resume its oil production and exports to the levels prior to the dispute with the un soon  in the short run  suezmax tce s could be lower than the recent peak as the other opec members have decided to reduce their oil production quotas by million b d beginning february   and an additional million b d beginning april   to support oil prices 
the oil inventory is expected to show a significant draw in the first quarter because opec cut oil production  iraq reduced oil exports  and the substitution of oil for gas in the us due to very high gas prices 
furthermore  the above events will reduce the usual commercial oil stock build in the second quarter 
this would set the stage for stronger oil and tanker markets in the second half of as world economic activity improves and oil supply demand fundamentals become materially tighter 
the world tanker fleet totaled approximately million dwt at the end of  up by million dwt or from the year end level  while tanker tonne mile demand in increased by compared to the level 
the tanker orderbook for delivery over the next few years totaled approximately million dwt  or of the existing tanker fleet at the end of approximately million dwt of the orderbook is scheduled for delivery in  million dwt in  million dwt in and the balance in the tanker orderbook includes suezmaxes of approximately million dwt  or of the existing internationally trading suezmax tanker fleet  and vlccs of million dwt  or of the existing vlcc fleet 
however  approximately million dwt or of the total tanker fleet was or more years old at the end of  and about million dwt or of the existing fleet was or more years old 
in addition  suezmax tankers of about million dwt or of the existing suezmax tanker fleet was or more years old 
these old vessels are facing increasingly stricter environmental regulations 
tanker deletions were relatively high in  despite the substantial improvement of tanker tce s that reached very profitable levels 
tanker deletions totaled about million dwt in  including a vlcc which was converted to an offshore floating production and storage facility 
the total tanker deletions in include suezmaxes and vlccs 
tanker deletions are expected to continue at high levels in the foreseeable future given the relatively high orderbook  the tanker fleet age demographics  stricter enforcement of existing tanker regulations by classification societies  stricter inspections by charterers and the new proposed tanker regulations by the international maritime organization imo for approval in april these proposed regulations  similar to the opa regulations in the united states  would tighten controls of tankers  put pressure for more rigorous policing of regulations  and in general  make employment of old tankers more difficult and accelerate the phase out of single hull tankers 
furthermore  it is expected that more tankers will be sold for conversion to offshore units due to increasing offshore oil exploration and production activities 
world oil demand increased by about million b d in and is expected to grow faster in  notwithstanding the current economic slowdown in the usa the expected increase in oil demand would reflect lower average oil prices in  high north american natural gas prices that have induced power producers to switch to less expensive fuels as well as expected improvement of world economic activity in the second half of the year 
commercial stocks of crude oil  gasoline and middle distillates in the major oil consuming areas north america  western europe and japan at the end of were at about the low level prevailing a year earlier 
the loss in iraqi oil recently and opec s quota reduction should keep stocks relatively low in the foreseeable future 
the expected gains in world oil demand  the presence of relatively low oil stock levels  a relatively modest tanker supply growth  given the fleet age demographics and lower newbuilding deliveries this year  and the preference of governments and charterers for safe  high quality modern tonnage  would maintain the strong tanker freight environment this year 
product tanker overview the product carrier market operates in a more stable rate environment than the crude oil market and has traditionally provided ship owners with a predictable stream of revenues 
the product carrier market is a segment of the overall tanker market  which transports petroleum products such as gasoline  jet fuel  kerosene  naphtha and gas oil 
crude oil tankers carry oil from production areas to refineries  while product carriers move refined products from refineries to distribution points 
the product tanker market continued to improve with each quarter in and tce s for handysize product tankers in the caribbean reached levels not seen since the very strong product tanker market during the iraqi kuwaiti conflict ten years ago 
this was the result of continued strong oil demand growth in the atlantic region at a time that oil product inventories were very low  the charterers reduced preference for old vessels in favor of quality product tanker tonnage after the erika incident  and the moderate product tanker fleet increase in freight rates for product tankers have continued to be strong to date in the strong product tanker market is expected to continue this year due to expected increase of world oil demand  the tight oil product markets in the atlantic region  and the relatively modest product tanker fleet growth given the orderbook for delivery this year and the continued deletion of old product tanker tonnage due to the erika incident 
the world product tanker fleet totaled million dwt at the end of  up by million dwt or from the year earlier level  while tonne mile demand for product tankers in increased by compared to the level 
the product tanker orderbook for delivery over the next few years totaled million dwt  or of the existing product tanker fleet at the end of approximately million dwt are scheduled for delivery in  million dwt in and the balance in at the same time  about million dwt or of the existing fleet was or more years old and million dwt or of the existing fleet was or more years old 
given the moderate product tanker orderbook and the age profile of the existing product tanker fleet  the planned new strict tanker regulations by imo will have substantial impact on the product tanker sector 
the company believes that product carrier demand will continue to increase in the foreseeable future because world oil demand is expected to increase at a higher rate compared to the second half of the s 
additionally  the major oil consuming areas north america  western europe and asia have a shortage of refinery capacity  while latin america  africa and the middle east have a surplus 
furthermore  refinery capacity is expanding in the middle east and latin america while the shortage of refinery capacity in the major oil consuming areas is expected to persist 
finally  there have been some fundamental changes in the pattern of product trades toward longer haul movements 
results of operations results of operations of omi corporation include operating activities of the company s vessels 
the following discussion explains the company s operating results in terms of net voyage revenues and tce revenues 
net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus vessel and voyage expenses including charter hire expense 
consistent with industry practice  the company uses tce revenue voyage revenue less voyage expenses or tce rate calculations as a measure of analyzing fluctuations in voyage revenue between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue 
under a voyage charter  the operator of a vessel agrees to provide the vessel for the transport of specific goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  for a specified total amount 
all operating costs are for the operator s account 
a single voyage charter generally two to ten weeks is often referred to as a spot market charter 
vessels in the spot market may also spend time idle or laid up as they await business 
a voyage charter involving more than one voyage with the same charterer is commonly known as a consecutive voyage charter 
a time charter involves the placing of a vessel at the charterer s disposal for a set period of time during which the charterer may use the vessel in return for the payment by the charterer of a specified daily or monthly hire rate 
in time charters  operating costs such as for crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer 
under a bareboat charter  the charterer takes possession of the vessel in return for a specified amount payable to the owner of the vessel 
the bareboat charterer must provide its own crew  pay all operating and voyage expenses and is responsible for the operation and management of the vessel 
voyage  time and bareboat charters are available for varying periods  ranging from a single trip to a long term arrangement approximating the useful life of the ship to commercial firms such as oil companies and governmental agencies both foreign and domestic on a worldwide basis 
in general  a long term charter affords the vessel owner greater assurance that it will be able to cover its costs  including depreciation  interest  and operating costs 
operating the vessel in the spot market affords the owner greater speculative opportunity  which may result in high rates when ships are in high demand or low rates possibly insufficient to cover costs when ship availability exceeds demand 
ship charter rates are affected by world economics  international events  weather conditions  strikes  governmental policies  supply and demand  and many other factors beyond the control of omi 
currently  all of omi s fleet  except its ulcc  one suezmax and four product carriers  operate in the spot market 
in the discussion that follows total operating days are net of offhire days 
offhire days are any days that the vessel is not generating revenue due to drydock  special surveys  repairs and initial positioning of the vessel 
vessel expenses included in net voyage revenue discussed above include operating expenses such as crew wages and other related costs  stores  routine maintenance and repairs  amortization of drydock costs  insurance and miscellaneous 
these expenses are a function of the fleet size  utilization levels for certain expenses  requirements under laws  by charterer and company standards 
insurance expense varies with the overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured s loss record  level of insurance and desired coverage 
voyage revenues less vessel and voyage expenses for the years ended december  versus december  net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  increased by a net million from million for the year ended december  net voyage revenues for the years ended december   and are as follows by market segments in which omi primarily operates 
for the years ended december  in millions voyage revenues crude oil fleet product carrier fleet all other total vessel and voyage expenses crude oil fleet product carrier fleet all other total net voyage revenues crude oil fleet product carrier fleet all other total includes charter hire expenses 
excludes provision for loss on lease obligation of million 
net changes are discussed as follows according to the two market segments crude oil and product carrier in which omi primarily operates 
crude oil tanker fleet during  omi owned or operated crude carriers  including the two chartered in vessels redelivered in  compared to crude carriers at the end of during  omi sold its aframax vessel in march  took delivery of a suezmax newbuilding  which began its first voyage early april  took delivery of another new suezmax vessel in may  which began its first voyage early june and acquired one ulcc vessel  which was purchased on june  the company previously owned percent from omi s joint venture partner 
during  omi disposed of its four older crude carriers in the second half of the year and completed a sale leaseback in june for a new suezmax vessel delivered january net voyage revenues earned by the crude oil fleet for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the year ended december  the following table sets forth comparative operating results for the crude oil fleet for the year ended december  versus the year ended december for the years ended december  in millions crude fleet suezmaxes tce revenue vessel expenses charter hire expenses net voyage revenues ulcc tce revenue vessel expenses charter hire expenses net voyage revenues panamaxes tce revenue vessel expenses charter hire expenses net voyage revenues old suezmaxes aframax sold in tce revenue vessel expenses charter hire net voyage revenues total crude fleet net voyage revenue 
fluctuations in each of the crude oil fleet vessel types were as follows suezmaxes the largest increase in the crude oil fleet s net voyage revenue of million was earned by this group 
included in this group are the three chartered in vessels built in  and increases aggregating million in net voyage revenue during the year ended december  were attributed to the two newbuildings delivered in the first half of increases in the remaining three wholly owned and three chartered in vessels aggregated million in over were primarily a result of increased tce s for vessels operating in the spot market 
the improvement in tce rates above the increase in bunker costs in resulted from better market conditions as described in the market overview 
ulcc increase in net voyage revenues of million in was the result of omi s purchase of its joint venture partner s interest 
the venture owned one ulcc vessel  which became wholly owned by omi on june  panamaxes increases of million in the panamaxes net voyage revenues for the year over was the result of better performance in the star tankers pool 
increased rates for panamax vessels operating in the pool during resulted from steady demand as a result of tanker market fundamentals discussed in the market overview 
old suezmaxes aframax earnings for the old suezmaxes aframax group for the year ended december  reflect earnings for the first quarter of million  which primarily relates to the aframax vessel sold march net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  included earnings from four older suezmax vessels sold in the second half of and the aframax vessel 
during  the older suezmax vessels incurred operating losses or small profits 
product carrier fleet at december   omi owned product carriers  six handysize vessels which operated in the ipc pool and four product carriers on time charter 
during  two handymax newbuildings were delivered in september and november and began two year time charters with an oil company and four product carriers were sold  three in may and one in august during  omi operated product carriers in the ipc pool and owned two handysize product carrier newbuildings  which were delivered in july and september and time chartered for two years to an oil company 
the following table sets forth comparative operating results for the product carrier fleet for the years ended december  and december  for the years ended december  in millions product carrier fleet products ipc pool beginning second quarter tce revenue vessel expenses charter hire expenses net voyage revenues products on time charter tce revenue vessel expenses charter hire expenses net voyage revenues total product carrier net voyage revenue net voyage revenues earned by the product carrier fleet for the year ended december  was million  which is an increase of million over the year ended december  fluctuations in each of the product carrier groups were as follows product carriers ipc pool during year ended december   six before the sale of the three product carriers in may and one in august of the company s handysize product tankers have been operating on time charters to a joint venture  ipc  in a marketing alliance 
time charter rates from this venture reflect spot market rates since they are adjusted periodically with pool profits 
the vessels have been operating in this marketing pool since its inception in may prior to may  seven vessels were operating in the spot market 
three vessels coming off a previous time charter began operating with the ipc pool in the third quarter of increases in net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december   reflect the increase in profits earned primarily since the upswing in rates beginning in the second quarter compared to earnings from prior year spot charters for these vessels 
the increase in rates for the vessels operating in both and periods were offset by lower earnings from four vessels disposed of in the four vessels sold in operated a total of more days in 
improvement in the rates is consistent with the rise in the tce rates for this sector resulting from increased demand and other factors discussed in the market overview 
product carriers on time charter increases in net voyage revenue of million for the year ended december   relate to earnings from two built product carriers  which were delivered in the third quarter of and earnings from two handymax product carriers delivered september and november earnings for this group increased primarily from more operating days in and additional income for profit sharing based upon certain conditions included in the two time charter agreements  which began in all four vessels have been operating on time charters since their deliveries 
other operating expenses the company s operating expenses  other than vessel  voyage and charter hire expenses  consist of depreciation and amortization  general and administrative g a expenses  provision for loss on lease obligation and loss gain on disposal write down of assets net 
for the year ended december   these expenses decreased million to million  from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in the loss gain on disposal write down of assets net and the decrease in the provision for loss on lease obligation of million from to are the largest decreases in other operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  included depreciation expense for the nine vessels held for sale at december  the decreases in depreciation expense were offset in part by depreciation expense accounted for on the two new suezmaxes  which began operating in the second quarter of  the ulcc vessel acquired june and two handymax vessels in the fourth quarter of general and administrative g a increased million for the year ended december  over the comparable year the increase was partially a result of non cash compensation expense relating to option expense in provision for loss on lease obligation the provision for loss on lease obligation of million was recorded at june  and relates to one of omi s chartered in vessels 
the liability for the impairment was being amortized and recorded to charter hire expense over the remaining term of the lease until notice of early termination of the lease was given in october loss gain on disposal write down of assets net the net loss decreased million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the year ended december  the loss on disposal write down of assets of million relates to the disposals of four vessels and write downs of two vessels in adjustments for three vessels previously classified as assets to be disposed of at december  resulted in additional losses on the sale dates aggregating million 
two similar vessels net realizable values  which also were classified as assets to be disposed of at december  were adjusted during the first quarter by an aggregate of million 
a vessel sold in may resulted in a loss on disposal of million 
losses in were offset in part by the gain recorded of million from the early termination of two time charters  one part of the gain was from the accelerated amortization of the provision for loss on a lease obligation  discussed above 
the gain on early termination of the second charter resulted from accelerated amortization on the deferred gain on sale of the vessel by the company to its current owner 
loss on disposal of assets net  for the year ended december   included losses for fourteen vessels  nine vessels to be disposed of at december   four vessels which were disposed of in and one suezmax vessel  which was sold on june  in a sale leaseback transaction 
the loss on the vessels disposed of was million and losses as a result of write downs of vessels to their net realizable values  which were to be disposed of was million at december  the write down of vessels included the reversal of the cumulative translation adjustment for million 
the adjustment relates to two vessels whose functional currency until july was not us dollars 
other income expense other income expense consists of loss on disposal write down of investments  interest expense  interest income and other net 
net other expense decreased by million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  loss on disposal write down of investments was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to a loss on investments of million for the year ended december  the loss on disposal of investments resulted from the sale of a joint venture and the write down of a long term investment 
loss on disposal write down of investments during  represents the loss on omi s disposal of two joint ventures and write down of one venture sold in interest expense increased million for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  the increases were primarily due to interest expense on additional borrowings to finance newbuildings delivered in  the reduction in capitalized interest corresponding with the delivery of the new ships in addition to an average higher libor rate for the year and higher interest margins 
on october   omi amended its credit facility and increased it to million  which included the financing for the two new handymax vessels delivered september and november 
the amended facility reduced interest rate margins in the fourth quarter see financing activities for additional information relating to the amended credit facility 
other net of approximately million is an aggregate of the settlement of claims on various vessels during the year ended december  a loss of million was recorded in other net for the year ended december  resulting from the early payment in february of the mtc note receivable due november in exchange for a discount

net voyage revenues for the crude oil fleet of million for the year ended december  decreased a net of million from net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreases in net voyage revenue in the crude fleet of approximately million were primarily attributed to less earnings from the four vessels sold in  in addition to less earnings from a vessel sold in august  lower earnings in for the aframax vessel operating in the spot market and two panamax vessels with higher operating expenses in  and less earnings from chartered in vessels  particularly one  which was drydocked in and earned a lower tce compared to decreases in the crude oil fleet s net voyage revenue were offset in part by increases aggregating million from primarily three items 
first  the earnings of four new suezmax vessels delivered in and second  the increase in time charter revenue from a panamax vessel operating in a marketing pool in and the final item was the redelivery in december of a chartered in vessel  which incurred losses in product carrier fleet the product carrier fleet consisted of twelve handysize vessels at december  and ten handysize vessels in in november  may and july omi placed its three panamax vessels which previously carried clean products  into a marketing pool 
decreases in the product carrier fleet in the first half of pertain in part to two of the panamaxes which were carrying clean products in the first half and that carried crude oil included in the crude oil fleet s operating results in during the year ended december   the company s seven handysize product tankers were employed in the spot market and three on time charter 
on may   these vessels have were time chartered at the conclusion of their previous charters to the joint venture  ipc 
net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased million from net voyage revenues of million for the year ended december  decreases in net voyage revenues in resulted primarily from lower tce s for three vessels previously time chartered from until august when they began operating in the ipc pool

other operating expenses the company s operating expenses for the year ended december   increased million to million  from million for the year ended december  during  as part of omi s periodic review  the company evaluated the forecasted future net cash flows for vessels with lease obligations 
the company determined that one of its current lease obligations for vessels exceeded its undiscounted forecasted future net cash flows

a loss on disposal of omi s investment in geraldton of million was recorded at december  interest expense increased million for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  the additional interest expense was primarily due to additional borrowings to finance six newbuildings one of which was delivered and million financed during january and subsequently sold and repaid june  in a sale leaseback transaction and correspondingly a decrease in the capitalization of interest on construction in progress 
equity in operations of joint ventures 
equity in operations of joint ventures decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributed to lower earnings from two joint ventures  one which operated one ulcc vessel that was in drydock during the first half of and earned lower revenues due to declines in tce rates in and the other joint venture owning one suezmax vessel also experienced a decline in spot rates and was sold september  during  the company received an aggregate of million in dividends from joint ventures  million from amazon transport  inc and million from white sea 
during  omi paid million in capital contributions to one of its joint ventures 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the second quarter  omi changed its method of accounting for freight on voyage charters 
the accounting change was effective for the period beginning january  and income of million was recorded for the year ended december  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the change in the company s method of revenue recognition for voyages from the load to load basis to discharge to discharge basis is a more reliable method in recognizing voyage revenue as it eliminates the uncertainty associated with estimating location of the next load port under the load to load basis 
voyage revenue is recognized evenly over the period from the departure of a vessel from its original discharge port to departure at the next discharge port

cash flows for the year ended december  were stronger than the comparable year  and adjusted ebitda of million for the year was million above year of million 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher earnings  net of operating expenses in due to the disposal of five older crude carriers and the delivery of four new vessels 
the new vessels are more marketable than the older vessels disposed of and earn a higher tce rate and are more cost efficient

although the first quarter tce rates for vessels in the spot market have been lower than anticipated  they are well above levels at this time in the company expects that the second half of will generate higher rates as supply demand for oil is expected to increase as discussed in the market overview 
additionally  the company continues to seek opportunities as they arise to time charter vessels at attractive rates to maintain a secure stream of cash flows 
the company does not foresee any unusual increase in costs for its current fleet in  other than routine maintenance and repairs for maintaining high operating standards 
omi s costs for its vessels in were much lower than in the past due to higher costs in previous years to maintain older vessels 
some of omi s newer vessels that were delivered in and are approaching their first drydocks and or special surveys and will incur costs associated with periodic routine maintenance
