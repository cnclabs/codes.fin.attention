item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional business events 
business operations business strategy our goal is to create long term stockholder value by becoming a full service health care insurer and consumer services company  committed to making people s lives healthier and more secure 
to meet this goal  we plan to take actions to strengthen our existing operations 
we are focusing on implementing programs to strengthen our physician and hospital networks  and to reduce our medical care ratios and marketing  general and administrative expenses to improve our operating margins for our hmo business 
we intend to stabilize our medical care ratios through the pricing and design of our products and through our contracts with physicians and hospitals  continue to evaluate our product offerings and service areas to exit unprofitable medicare or commercial markets  invest in expanding membership in profitable markets and make market driven changes to product offerings  continue to market our secure horizons products to new members in medicare markets in which we choose to remain  continue to manage aggressively our marketing  general and administrative expenses by reducing overall employee population  while investing in key capabilities such as underwriting and claims processing  continue to build key capabilities to operate in a risk based environment  including our underwriting  medical management and claims processing systems  
table of contents outsource some functions in the information technology and medical management areas where we believe we can improve performance while reducing our costs  and continue to develop incentive programs to recruit  reward and retain key employees 
expand the health insurance portfolio 
responding to the desires of consumers to have more choice and flexibility in health care coverage  we intend to evolve beyond our current hmo product lines to offer a broader array of health insurance products 
we intend to launch a broader preferred provider organization ppo product on a stand alone basis as the first step toward broadening into non hmo products  launch other health care insurance products with a hybrid of managed care and ppo features  including medicare supplements and defined contribution plans  develop a program to sell medicare supplement products to disenrolling medicare choice members to diversify our medicare risk  and grow our pharmacy benefit management business  prescription solutions  by increasing sales of our services to third party health plans  expanding our mail order business and  if congress approves a prescription drug benefit for the medicare fee for service program  participating in that program 
move beyond traditional health insurance

table of contents commercial programs general 
our commercial membership has grown from approximately million members at december  to million members at december  for the commercial employer market  we offer a range of products and benefit plan designs that vary in the amount of member copayments 
these options allow employers flexibility in selecting cost effective benefit packages for their employees 
our employer group and individual products include hmo  ppo  point of service pos and employer self funded plans 
an hmo is a health care organization that combines aspects of a health care insurer with those of a health care provider by arranging for health care services for its members through a defined provider network at a reduced deductible or a nominal copayment 
a ppo is a selected group of providers  such as physician groups  that offers discounted fee for service health care 
pos plans combine the features of an hmo with the features of a traditional indemnity insurance product  allowing members to choose from a network of providers at a lower cost  or from physicians outside of the network at a higher deductible or copayment 
under employer self funded plans  we administer claims on behalf of employers  but do not assume the risk of these claims 
specialty products 
in addition to our hmo operations  we provide a range of specialty managed care products that supplement our hmo products and are primarily sold with our commercial plans 
these products include pharmacy benefit management 
rx solutions  inc  dba prescription solutions is one of the industry s largest pharmacy benefit management companies

premiums 
when pricing our commercial programs  we use underwriting criteria as an integral part of our commercial risk management efforts 
underwriting is the process by which a health plan assesses the risk of enrolling employer groups or 
table of contents individuals and establishes appropriate or necessary premium rates 
the setting of premium rates directly affects a health plan s profitability and marketing success 
see health care costs and physician and hospital relationships 
marketing 
commercial marketing is a two step process in which we first market to employer groups  then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our plan 
we use various techniques to attract commercial members  including work site presentations  direct mail  medical group tours and local advertising 
we also use television  radio  billboard and print media to market our programs 
insurance brokers and consultants represent many employer groups under contract with us 
these brokers and consultants work directly with employers to recommend or design employee benefits packages 
we pay insurance brokers commissions over the life of the contract  while employers generally pay consultants directly 
our commercial membership growth is a result of in market acquisitions as well as greater penetration in existing employer groups 
with each open enrollment  we identify a specific approach for each employer group with the objective of increasing the number of members from each employer to increase our penetration 
federal employees 
our hmos also have commercial contracts with the united states office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services to approximately  members under the fehbp for federal employees  annuitants and their dependents 
see government regulation and proposed legislation opm and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
retiree product 
in response to the needs of employers to provide cost effective health care coverage to their retired employees who may or may not be currently entitled to medicare  we offer the commercial retiree product 
this product draws on our medicare expertise by offering physician and hospital networks that are similar to those offered to our secure horizons enrollees 
we set our premiums generally based on the same revenue requirements needed to provide services to secure horizons members 
the retiree product gives us access to individuals who  once familiar with our services and delivery system  may enroll in secure horizons when they become eligible for medicare benefits 
small group and individual 
an employer with or fewer employees is considered a small group 
we now consider small groups as unique markets managed independently within each of our regions 
since september  we have established agreements with several e commerce distribution partners  making our small group and individual products accessible from hundreds of sites on the internet to provide free health insurance quotes 
we began by offering individual health products at insweb in california  and have since expanded to individual and small group offerings in our other states 
in february  we announced the launch of our premier plans in california  a new line of small group products sold through the internet 
this product s pricing reflects the reduced distribution costs of doing business online 
the premier plans are currently available to our california customers through electronic brokers via online insurance channels  our website www 
pacificare 
com and through traditional insurance brokers 
secure horizons program general 
for medicare beneficiaries  we offer access to health care services through our secure horizons program 
the secure horizons program is the largest medicare choice program in the united states as measured by membership 
secure horizons membership has grown from approximately million members at december  to approximately million members at december  premiums 
as a general rule  our medicare choice contracts entitle us to per member per month payments on behalf of each enrolled medicare beneficiary 
in addition  we  and all participants in the medicare choice program  are subject to periodic adjustments to premiums based upon retroactive changes in members status  such as medicaid eligibility and risk adjustments 
these periodic adjustments can be positive or negative 
effective january   our payments from the health care financing administration hcfa were adjusted for each individual based upon demographic factors including the age  gender  county of residence and medicaid status  as well as certain health status information relating to each enrollee 
under the provisions of hcfa s risk adjusted methodology  plans with enrollees who were hospitalized for more than one day in the previous year for select disease conditions  including certain cancers  cardiovascular problems  diabetes  and neurological disorders are paid more than for enrollees without these conditions 
these higher payments are determined from data that we  and all other medicare choice contracting organizations  are required to submit to hcfa 
the current risk adjuster  which is used to calculate percent of the plan s payment  will continue to be used through beginning in  the risk adjuster will be based on both inpatient hospitalization and ambulatory data 
the risk adjuster will continue to be modified according to the phase in schedule  and is expected to be at percent by see government regulation and proposed legislation hcfa and government regulation and proposed legislation adjusted community rate filings 

table of contents our medicare choice contracts are renewed every months unless hcfa or the medicare choice plan elects to terminate or not to renew the contract 
hcfa may also terminate medicare choice contracts if a plan fails to meet specified compliance standards 
termination of our medicare choice contracts would have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
under our medicare choice contracts  we also have the ability to close enrollment to new members with limited exceptions through either a formal capacity limit or a voluntary closure 
in general  closing enrollment requires a day advance public notice 
marketing 
we market our secure horizons programs to medicare beneficiaries primarily through direct mail  telemarketing  our website  television  radio and community based events with participating physician groups 
most secure horizons members enroll directly in a plan  generally without the involvement of insurance brokers  except when enrolling as part of an employer group retiree offering 
health care costs and physician and hospital relationships general 
the cost of prescription drugs and health care services has been rising over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future  leading to an increase in premiums 
the reasons for these increases have been numerous  including an aging population that has greater medical needs  the availability of more costly diagnostic and therapeutic procedures  new laws and regulations specifying covered services  increased prices for medications and the introduction of more expensive medications  growth in the number of hospitals and medical specialists under non capitated contracts  increased utilization of services  defensive medical practices due to physicians fear of lawsuits  significant investments by pharmaceutical companies in advertising campaigns for branded drugs  in turn driving consumer demand for these drugs  increased instability in hospital and specialty networks  contributing to increased medical costs 
many hospitals have merged with larger hospital systems resulting in increased contract negotiating leverage with hmos  and consumer demand for easy access to and choice of physicians and hospitals  low out of pocket costs and coverage of lifestyle prescription drugs 
contracting arrangements with physicians and hospitals 
we use contracting processes that include analysis and modeling of underlying cost and utilization assumptions 
through these processes  we expect to identify strategies to better manage health care costs 
we provide incentives to the physician or medical groups for improving the quality of care  as well as to encourage appropriate utilization of hospital inpatient  outpatient surgery and emergency room services 
we believe improved business consultation and management tools  including more thorough data reporting and financial analysis of expected performance of our contracts  will enable us to create more financially successful physician and hospital networks 
we primarily focus on securing cost effective physician  hospital and other health care provider contracts to maintain a qualified network of providers in each geographic area we serve  as well as improving the medical management of health services to achieve both better quality and cost effective care 
many of our physician and hospital contracts have one year terms 
however  we also have a number of multiple year contracts with physician groups and hospitals to ensure the quality and stability of our network 
capitation arrangements 
traditionally  we have contracted with physician organizations as well as many hospitals and ancillary providers on a prepaid  capitated fixed fee per member per month basis  regardless of the services provided to each member 
capitation payments to physicians and hospitals may be based on a percentage of the premium we receive  which is especially true for our secure horizons contracts  or a fixed per member per month amount that is adjusted to reflect membership age  sex and benefit variation 
under our capitated contracts  medical groups may assume administration functions  including physician 
table of contents management and claims processing  to support management of health care services 
we continue to believe that delegation of agreed upon functions empowers our physicians and hospitals to provide quality service and care 
provider delegated administration 
most of our capitated physician and hospital networks have qualified through our assessment processes to perform some or all of the administrative functions associated with operating in a capitated environment  such as paying claims and providing medical management 
in those situations  we provide support for their administrative functions to help them achieve greater levels of efficiency 
moreover  we only delegate medical management duties to physicians and hospitals with demonstrated and consistent acceptable performance of these functions 
hmo direct administration 
we perform all the direct management functions  such as claims payment and medical management  mainly on behalf of physician networks that do not have the capability to manage the administrative functions associated with operating in a capitated environment 
in addition  we work with those physicians to assist them in developing the capability to assume a greater share of the administrative functions 
we continue to develop our own expertise in this area to ensure that we can continue to build strong networks for our members in both existing and new markets where physicians may not be capable of performing these functions 
risk based arrangements 
we share the risk of health care costs with parties not covered by capitation arrangements 
under the majority of our risk based arrangements  the physician group is capitated for physician services only 
therefore  our risk based contracts generally include budgeted amounts for hospital inpatient  outpatient surgery  and emergency room service utilization 
in some cases  if member utilization for hospital services exceeds the agreed upon budgeted amount  we share these excess costs with the physician group based on provisions specified in the contract 
depending on how the contract is arranged  health care costs may be apportioned between two or more entities 
for example  we may share excess hospital costs with the physician group only or with both the physician group and the hospital provider 
fee for service arrangements including directly contracted network model 
we contract with other hospitals and ancillary providers  as well as some individual physicians or physician organizations  to provide services to our members based on modified discounted fee schedules such as the medicare fee schedule for the services provided 
where the provider community is not organized around aggregate physician groups or if it requires more extensive medical management and or administrative services  we contract with physicians through our directly contracted network model 
this model allows individual physicians to serve our members through a program that generally compensates physicians on a discounted fee for service basis and incorporates some elements of risk sharing through the development and adherence to agreed upon budgets 
under these arrangements  we perform all administrative functions required for effective management of quality  medical costs and claims payment 
the trend away from capitated contracts to risk based and fee for service agreements continues  especially for hospital services 
the percentages of membership by contract type at december  and were as follows hospital physician at december  commercial capitated risk based fee for service secure horizons capitated risk based fee for service total capitated risk based fee for service physician and hospital contracting risk 
our profitability depends  in part  on our ability to control health care costs while providing quality care 
as we shift from our capitation model to a risk based environment  we face the risk that we will not be able to control our health care costs to the same degree as was possible under fully capitated contracts 
the following are risks associated with our physician and hospital contracting arrangements 
table of contents insolvency risk 
under capitated arrangements  we face the risk of a physician group or physician association becoming insolvent 
depending on state law  we may be held liable for unpaid health care claims that were previously the responsibility of the capitated physician and for which we have already paid capitation 
to reduce this insolvency risk  we have developed contingency plans that include shifting members to other physicians and reviewing operational and financial plans to monitor and maximize financial and network stability 
some of our physicians require more frequent monitoring 
we may incur additional health care costs in the event of physician instability where we are unable to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial 
these costs may be incurred when we need to contract with other physicians at less than cost effective rates to continue providing health care to our members 
utilization risk 
under fee for service and risk based contracts  we risk incurring higher than expected health care costs due to increased utilization of hospital and physician services 
to reduce the risk of higher than medically warranted utilization  we are focused on developing medical management programs to manage health care costs and investing in the development of systems to monitor and manage the utilization of health care services  while maintaining quality of care 
medical management 
in efforts to reduce the financial risk associated with risk based and fee for service arrangements  we are focusing on enhancing our internal medical management programs 
our medical management staff consists of doctors and nurses who monitor the medical treatment of our members in need of hospital care 
in some cases  our medical managers are located on site for some of our key hospitals 
our medical management programs are composed of a precertification of admission process  a concurrent review process  and a retrospective review 
in the precertification stage  our medical managers are responsible for determining that requests for hospitalization and specified health care procedures meet specific clinical criteria and are approved in advance 
our concurrent review process begins once our member has been admitted to the hospital for care with our medical managers responsible for providing administrative oversight of the hospital process 
the medical manager is also responsible for monitoring the discharge process  and coordinating any outpatient services needed by the patient  including skilled nursing facility  home nursing care and rehabilitation therapy 
finally  our retrospective review process occurs when our medical management staff is not directly involved in the hospitalization of our members 
this can occur when our members receive emergency care at an out of area hospital 
with our increased number of risk based and fee for service arrangements  we have an increased need for medical management 
to meet this need  we plan to increase medical management staffing by percent to more than full time employees in a small number of our members with chronic diseases continue to drive a significant portion of our health care costs 
our emphasis on disease management focuses on member education and prevention to improve our members health and reduce costs 
our analysis has shown that five percent of seniors consume more than percent of health care expenses within a year and four diseases account for percent of the costs within that subset 
as a result  we are developing programs in coronary artery disease  congestive heart failure  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and end stage renal disease to better address the health needs of those patients 
we are also entering into contracts with outside parties to assist us with our disease management programs 

table of contents health care quality general 
we are convinced that providing our members access to continually improved health care services leads to improved health for our members 
to assure this  we focus on physician peer review procedures  physician and hospital quality reviews  member quality initiatives and national industry measures 
physician peer review procedures 
we have established a comprehensive peer review procedure at each hmo  governed by a quality improvement committee 
the medical director for each hmo chairs that hmo s committee 
each committee consists of health plan clinical professionals and physician representatives from the contracted physician groups 
all physicians are initially credentialed and approved by that hmo s quality improvement committee 
the quality assessment includes evaluating the performance of that physician  as well as the quality of the providers medical facilities  medical records  laboratory and x ray licenses and their capacity to handle membership demands 
physician and hospital quality reviews 
we also engage in ongoing quality reviews of our existing physicians and hospitals to ensure that members are receiving quality medical care 
a highlight of our physician and hospital management program is our provider profile  which is a comprehensive  quarterly risk adjusted report card of over measures  which helps physicians and hospitals manage their performance in the areas of clinical quality  utilization management  service quality and administrative efficiency 
in addition  the provider profile serves as the data source for the quality index  which is a public report on our contracting medical groups performance in the areas of clinical  service and administrative data quality 
this report provides consumers with information to help them become more active participants in their health care  beginning with their selection of health care providers 
in addition  the quality index has statistically proven to significantly improve performance and consistency in virtually all indicators that have been continually measured 
our member information materials highlight best performing physician groups  so that members have credible and relevant information by which to select physicians 
member quality initiatives 
to improve the quality of service and health for our members  we have developed a comprehensive quality improvement program that includes implementing comprehensive health management programs in diabetes  congestive heart failure  cardiovascular risk reduction and depression  aimed at improving health outcomes  conducting preventive health programs  cancer screening  smoking cessation  and senior health risk assessments  offering independent external review programs to members in which members can have a service or treatment denial of coverage decision reviewed by a physician or panel of physicians outside their health plan  decreasing inappropriate denials and improving the appeals process for our members  standardizing and streamlining our specialty provider referral process  utilizing our justone ready reply approach in california  oklahoma and texas  which is designed to resolve members issues and answer questions with a single phone call by the member 
we handle all necessary contact between the plan  physicians  hospitals and medical groups through the final resolution of the issue  and then report the outcome to the member  participating in the coalition for affordable quality health care s voluntary quality initiative 
along with other organizations  we have committed to enabling consumers to have access to quality coverage and information  improving administrative simplicity for doctors and consumers  and working with doctors to improve overall health care quality and patient safety  monitoring member satisfaction through surveys and internal operational report cards compared to our current established benchmarks  and providing members free access to in depth health information on thousands of topics via the internet at www 
pacificare 
com 
national industry measures 
the national committee for quality assurance ncqa is an independent  non profit organization that reviews and accredits hmos 
our hmos provide quality and service information under ncqa s health plan employer data information set program 
ncqa also performs site reviews to determine if an hmo complies with standards it has established for 
table of contents quality improvement  utilization management  physician and hospital credentialing and a commitment to members rights and preventive health services 
hmos that comply with ncqa s review requirements and quality standards receive ncqa accreditation 
we have improved our ncqa scores by implementing our membership and physician and hospital quality programs 
at december   our hmos in arizona  california  colorado  nevada  oklahoma  oregon  texas and washington covering approximately percent of our membership have received either commendable or excellent three year ncqa accreditation 
risk management we shift part of our risk of catastrophic losses by maintaining reinsurance coverage for specified hospital costs incurred in the treatment of catastrophic illnesses 
we require contracting physicians  physician groups and hospitals to maintain individual malpractice insurance coverage 
we also maintain general liability  property  managed care errors and omissions and medical malpractice insurance coverage in amounts that we believe to be adequate 
government regulation and proposed legislation general 
our hmos are subject to extensive federal and state regulations that govern the scope of benefits provided to our members  financial solvency requirements  claims processing  quality assurance and utilization review procedures  member grievance procedures  physician and hospital contracts  marketing and advertising 
our hmos are also required to maintain restricted cash reserves represented by interest bearing investments that are held by trustees or state regulatory agencies 
these requirements  which limit the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds  may also limit their ability to pay dividends 
from time to time  we advance funds to our subsidiaries to assist them in satisfying federal or state financial requirements 
our behavioral health  insurance and dental subsidiaries are also subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
hcfa 
our secure horizons program is subject to regulations by hcfa  the united states department of health and human services and state regulatory entities 
these agencies govern the benefits provided  premiums paid  quality assurance procedures  marketing and advertising for our medicare choice products 
see business operations secure horizons program 
congress enacted the balanced budget act of bba  which required the creation of the medicare choice program as a replacement to the medicare risk program 
hcfa has since promulgated regulations  operational policy letters and contracts implementing medicare choice  including the balanced budget refinement act of and the benefits improvement and protection act of bipa 
these contracts and regulations established new and expanded requirements for medicare choice organizations 
they also establish new or expanded standards for quality assurance  beneficiary protection  coordinated open enrollment  program payment and audits  information disclosure and physician and hospital participation 
compliance with medicare choice regulations has and will continue to increase our medicare administration costs 
bipa was passed by congress in december  effective for under the new law  medicare choice will receive increased government funding over the next five years beginning in march the changes for include increases to the monthly minimum payment floors  increases in the minimum annual payment update from two percent to three percent and modifications to the risk adjuster 
see secure horizons program premiums 
it is possible that future legislation may create additional changes in the payment formula or risk adjuster 
however  it is not certain that efforts to revise the laws governing the medicare choice program will succeed 
the loss of medicare contracts or changes in the program could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
adjusted community rate filings 
as a result of the balanced budget act of and related hcfa rules and regulations  our hmo subsidiaries are required to submit separate adjusted community rate acr proposals for every medicare choice plan they offer to medicare beneficiaries 
these rates are based upon our average commercial rate for non medicare enrollees modified by a factor that represents the difference in utilization characteristics between medicare and non medicare enrollees within each geographic area 
in effect  our benefits structure for secure horizons is established based on these rates 
each of our subsidiaries must submit the acr proposals  generally by county or service area  to hcfa by july for each medicare choice plan offered in the subsequent year 
in the normal course of business  all information submitted as part of the acr process is subject to audit by hcfa or any person or organization designated by hcfa 
our acr proposal is based on historical data and information available to us at the time of the filing 
potential changes to physician and hospital contracts and market and or competitive conditions may cause actual results to vary from the projections submitted 
in january  hcfa contracted with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services to conduct more comprehensive audits on one third of all acr filings as mandated by law 
during  audits were conducted in colorado  nevada and texas 
no violations were noted as a result of the audits 
in addition to the regular acr proposals submitted in  medicare choice plans were required to re submit acr proposals in january in accordance with bipa 
in our acr resubmission  bipa required that we 
table of contents use increased funding to do one or a combination of the following to reduce member premiums or cost sharing  to enhance benefits  to contribute to a benefits stabilization fund  or to stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to physicians and hospitals so long as such action does not result in increased beneficiary premiums  cost sharing  or reduced benefits 
our january acr submission has been filed in accordance with bipa and accompanying acr instructions  and has been accepted by hcfa 
employee retirement income security act of erisa 
pursuant to erisa  the federal government regulates insured and self insured health coverage plans offered by employers 
there have been recent highly publicized legislative attempts to amend erisa to remove the current limitation on the ability of states to regulate employer health plans and the limitations on an employee s ability to sue a health plan under state law 
if such proposals were enacted  states may have the ability to regulate other aspects of our business operations  and increase our exposure to state law claims that relate to employee health benefits 
if such proposals were enacted  the federal government may propose rules on claims payment and appeals processes which accomplish the intent of the proposed patient bill of rights 
additionally  if such proposals were enacted  they may result in increased operating costs 
health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
hipaa s federal standards apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets 
hipaa requires us to guarantee the availability and renewability of health insurance for certain employers  employees and individuals  limit the use of preexisting condition exclusions  disclose prior coverage  and make it easier for members to continue coverage in cases where an employee is terminated or changes employers 
hipaa also prohibits us from discriminating against potential enrollees on the basis of health status 
hipaa includes administrative simplification provisions directed at standardizing transactions and codes  establishing uniform health care provider  payor  employer and patient identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
publication of the hipaa proposed and final rules has occurred in phases 
the first set of final rules  which focus on data standards and code sets  were published in august given the month implementation window from final rule publication date  compliance is required for the data standards and code sets by october we have reviewed our systems and processes for compliance with the data standard requirements  and are planning activities to implement the new data requirements 
we are also working with various groups to find a common way to work with external business associates  such as physicians and hospitals  to ensure their compliance with the hipaa rules 
we estimate that our hipaa compliance costs will approximate million in our estimate of hipaa compliance costs may change as current hipaa rules evolve and additional rules are released or as we continue to evaluate the work required to modify our existing information technology and development systems 
both federal and state regulators have enforcement responsibilities for hipaa 
as a result  we may encounter different interpretations of hipaa s provisions in the different states  as well as varying enforcement philosophies in states where we operate hmos 
these differences may inhibit our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
ultimately  under hipaa and other state laws  cost control through physician and hospital contracting and coordinating care may become more important  and we believe our experience in these areas will allow us to compete effectively 
opm 
we have commercial contracts with opm to provide managed health care services to federal employees  annuitants and their dependents under the fehbp 
rather than negotiating rates with us  opm requires us to provide the fehbp with rates comparable to the rates charged to the two employer groups with enrollment closest in size to the fehbp in the applicable community after making required adjustments 
opm further requires us to certify each year that its rates meet these requirements 
periodically  opm s office of inspector general oig audits us to verify that the premiums charged are calculated and charged in compliance with these regulations and guidelines 
each audit encompasses a period of up to six years 
following the government s initial on site audit  opm will provide us with a post audit briefing indicating its preliminary results 
interpretations of the rating regulations and audit findings often raise complex issues 
the final resolution and settlement of audits have historically taken more than three years and as many as seven years 
we have a number of pending audits that we are seeking to resolve with the united states department of justice doj 
during the audit process  opm may refer its findings to the doj if it believes that we knowingly overcharged the government or otherwise submitted false documentation or certifications in violation of the false claims act 
under the false claims act  an action 
table of contents can be considered knowingly committed if the government contractor acted with actual knowledge  or with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of the government s rules and regulations 
if the government were to win a false claims act lawsuit against us  the government could obtain trebled damages  a civil penalty of not less than  nor more than  for each separate alleged false claim  and the government could permanently disqualify us from participating in all federal government programs 
in late  we established a formal compliance program to specifically address potential issues that may arise from the fehbp rating process  to work with opm to understand its interpretation of the rules and guidelines prior to completion of the rating process  to standardize the fehbp rating process among all of our hmos  and to help reduce the likelihood that future government audits will result in any significant findings 
based on the results of a limited number of audits that have been conducted for contract years and later  we believe that this program has been effective 
see item legal proceedings opm litigation and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of opm matters referred to the doj 
management information systems general 
we use computer based management information systems for various purposes  including e commerce  marketing and sales tracking  underwriting  billing  claims processing  medical management  medical cost and utilization trending  financial and management accounting  reporting  planning and analysis 
these systems also support member  employer group and physician and hospital service functions  including on line access to membership verification  claims and referral status and information regarding hospital admissions and lengths of stay 
in addition  these systems support our tracking and extensive analyses of cost and outcome data 
we continually enhance and upgrade our computer information systems to preserve our investment in existing systems  embrace new technologies  improve the cost effectiveness and quality of our services  introduce new products  and continue to meet legal and regulatory requirements 
ongoing system investments include upgrading system platforms  enhancing existing software  implementing purchased software  migrating to more suitable software database environments and making other investments required to make our systems comply with hipaa 
simplification  integration and expansion of the systems servicing our business are important components of controlling health care and administrative expenses and improving member and physician and hospital satisfaction 
we selectively outsource some technical functions and employ third party data collection agencies for electronic data interfaces edi to receive claims electronically 
we have recovery plans in place to mitigate the effect of information systems outages  if necessary 
to the extent that these systems fail to operate  however  it could have a material effect on results of operations or cash flows of a future period 
claims processing systems 
we use computer based information systems as an important component of claims processing 
we receive medical claims from physicians and hospitals for services to our members 
claims are reviewed to determine member eligibility  the quantity and kind of services performed and whether services were authorized 
to ensure accuracy  we regularly review reports on inventory levels and claims statistics that focus on claims turn around and accuracy of payment 
under our capitated contracts  most of our physicians and hospitals have qualified through our assessment processes to perform administration functions  including claims processing 
under our risk based contracts  we perform administrative functions  including claims processing 
due to the trend away from capitated contracts to risk based and fee for service arrangements  we have increasing financial and regulatory risk for the accurate and timely processing of claims 
the california department of managed health care issued a censure against us for late payment of claims to physicians and hospitals 
in march of  we reached a settlement with the department of managed health care  whereby related interest and penalties will not exceed million 
we expect to complete payment for the claims and interest by the end of march  bringing us in full compliance 
the late payments were caused by the rapid shift from capitation contracts to risk based and fee for service arrangements 
because of the shift  we experienced a dramatic increase in claims volume in california 
we have taken steps to correct the situation 
as part of our efforts  we upgraded our claims processing software and enhanced our edi submission and batch processing capabilities 
to further reduce our financial and regulatory risk associated with the accurate and timely processing of claims  we intend to eliminate retroactive provider contracts to better manage our costs and claims volume fluctuations  streamline medical management practices to improve administration  
table of contents increase claims processing staff to support the higher level of claims volume associated with risk based arrangements  and when necessary  consider using third party administrators to leverage our existing claims processing capabilities 
competition in general  the health care industry has experienced significant consolidation 
acute care hospitals have consolidated  increasing their leverage in the market place 
continued consolidation of insurance carriers  other hmos  employer self funded programs and ppos  some of which have substantially larger enrollments or greater financial resources than ours  have created competition for physicians  hospitals and members  impacting profitability and the ability to influence medical management 
pharmacy benefit management companies have continued to consolidate  competing with the pharmacy cost management capability of our wholly owned subsidiary  prescription solutions 
in offering health insurance coverage  we compete with cigna health corporation  aetna us healthcare inc and unitedhealth group for membership from national employers 
we also compete with regional hmos and small group employers  which vary depending on the geographic market 
regional competitors include kaiser foundation health plan  health net inc  wellpoint health networks inc  and humana inc 
we also offer a regional alternative for national employers who are willing to support multiple health plans to maintain plans that best suit the needs of employees within a specific region 
we have the highest medicare membership in the nation  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of overall membership  offering competitive advantages and economies of scale in the medicare choice market 
many health plans have exited the medicare hmo market due to changes in federal law that reduced medicare reimbursement rates 
while we have benefited in certain regions from our competitors market exits  the long term impact of reduced federal funding on enrollment trends in medicare choice hmo programs is uncertain 
other competitors include hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
these competitors have combined to form their own networks to contract directly with employer groups  and other prospective customers for the delivery of health care services 
our pharmacy benefit management company  prescription solutions  is an integral part of our commercial and medicare products  however  prescription solutions is also sold as a stand alone product supporting members of other health plans and employer groups 
competitors include merck medco managed care  wellpoint pharmacy management  med impact  express scripts and advance pcs 
we believe  when aligned with an hmo  prescription solutions differentiates itself from other pharmacy benefit organizations by managing prescription costs and outcomes for the hmo members 
our mail order prescription drug service competes with national  regional and local pharmacies and other mail order prescription drug companies 
pacificare behavioral health of california  inc and pacificare behavioral health  inc serve our hmo members in california  colorado  oklahoma  oregon  texas and washington  as well as non pacificare hmo members in arizona and new mexico 
california is among many states that have adopted parity legislation  requiring employers to offer equal coverage for mental health benefits  which we believe enhances our behavioral health business future growth potential 
competitors may include other behavioral health plans and employers that move to self insurance 
we believe that to retain our health plans competitive advantages we should continue to focus on developing additional products and services and eliminate or limit growth of unprofitable products 
we believe that consumers want products and services that go beyond basic necessity and extend to areas such as lifestyle  senior independent living and financial security 
the factors that we believe give us competitive advantages are our significant existing market position in our geographic areas of operation  our long term operating experience in managed care  our generally favorable marketplace reputation with physicians  hospitals  members and employers  a strong brand identity for secure horizons  our emphasis on providing high quality customer service  and our continual improvement of the quality of care provided to our members

these providers  including the california medical association  accuse us of imposing unfair contract terms  unnecessarily denying health care for our members  delaying payments for authorized health care and reimbursing physicians at rates that are not sufficient to cover the physician s cost of providing the health care 
in october  the multi district litigation panel consolidated the hitsman cases  the breen case  the california medical association case and certain provider cases in the southern district of florida 
in december  the court granted our motion to compel arbitration of all of the hitsman claims and all of dr 
breen s claims except for his claims for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims that stem from contractual relationships with other managed care companies

the attorney general of texas has filed similar claims against our texas hmo and has proposed to settle the lawsuit on the same terms as the aetna settlement 
the business practices in question relate primarily to our texas hmo s commercial operations 
resolution of a proposed settlement is still pending 
we are unable to predict whether we will ultimately reach a settlement with the attorney general on these or other terms or the impact that the ultimate settlement could have on our operations 
these changes ultimately could adversely affect the hmo industry and could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows of a future period
