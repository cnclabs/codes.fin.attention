item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we offer our products and services as either integrated systems or individual components primarily through three business lines traditional production equipment and services  through which we provide standardized components  replacement parts and used components and equipment servicing  engineered systems  through which we provide customized  large scale integrated oil and gas production systems  and automation and control systems  through which we provide control panels and systems that monitor and control oil and gas production 
for financial reporting purposes  however  we report our canadian operations  which combine traditional production equipment and services and engineered systems  as its own segment 
we therefore report four separate business segments traditional production equipment and services  engineered systems  automation and control systems and canadian operations 
we recognize revenues from significant contracts contracts greater than  and longer than four months in duration and all automation and control systems contracts and orders on the percentage of completion method 
earned revenue is based on the percentage of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs 
if estimated total costs on any contract or work in process indicate a loss  we recognize the entire loss immediately 
we generally recognize revenues and earnings to which the percentage of completion method applies over a period of two to six quarters 
we record revenues on other sales as shipments are made 
in january  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock with net proceeds of million 
in july  we changed our presentation of certain assets that were acquired from the cynara company in november  and the related operating results  for segment reporting purposes 
the majority of the assets were reclassified to the traditional production equipment and services business segment from the engineered systems business segment 
this change has been retroactively reflected in all periods presented

acquisitions in november  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of the cynara company  a designer and manufacturer of specialized production equipment utilizing membrane technology to separate bulk co from natural gas streams  for approximately million   shares of our common stock and the right to receive additional shares of common stock based upon the financial performance of the cynara assets 
ultimately  we had issued  additional shares as of december  in january  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of porta test international  inc  a manufacturer of centrifugal devices used to enhance the effectiveness of separation equipment  for approximately million and the right to receive additional payments based upon the performance of certain porta test assets 
in february  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of modular production equipment  inc mpe  a designer and manufacturer of wastewater treatment separation systems specializing in hydrocyclone technology  for approximately million 
in april  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of engineered specialties inc esi  a provider of proprietary technologies for oily water treatment and heavy metals removal from production at or near the wellhead  for approximately million 
on march   we acquired all the outstanding share capital of axsia group limited  a privately held process and design company based in the united kingdom  for approximately million 
axsia specializes in the design and supply of water reinjection systems for oil and gas fields  oily water treatment  oil separation  hydrogen production and other process equipment systems 
this acquisition was financed with borrowings under our new credit facility 
we accounted for each of the above transactions using the purchase method of accounting 
industry and business environment generally  oil and gas exploration and production companies reduce exploration and development activity during periods of weak oil prices and demand and increase this activity during periods of strong oil prices and demand 
the extent to which the revenues of the industry increase depends in part upon the success of the exploration efforts 
in general  these revenue increases lag expansion of exploration and development capital budgets in times of recovery in the oil and gas industry 
these lag times can be up to several years in offshore operations but are generally shorter for onshore operations 
changing production profiles in existing fields also increase the demand for products and services in the industry 
as existing fields are reworked or enhanced recovery methods are employed due to depletion  additional and more complex equipment may be required to produce oil and gas from these fields 
this can result from changes in the mix of oil and gas produced by the field or an increase in water  co or other naturally occurring contaminants or as the result of enhanced recovery techniques 
in addition  many new oil and gas fields produce lower quality or contaminated hydrocarbon streams that require more complex production equipment 
examples include co rich formations in west texas and southeast asia and heavy crude in western canada and in the orinoco delta in venezuela 
throughout much of  the oil and gas industry was suffering the effects of a significant decline in overall drilling and production expenditures by oil and gas operators due to low hydrocarbon prices 
since our business is closely linked to the market conditions of our customers  lower drilling and production expenditures can result in a reduction of our revenues 
our traditional production equipment and services business segment was affected most significantly as this business line primarily provides replacement parts used in oil and gas production 
an indicator of capital spending in the oil and gas industry is commodity prices 
energy prices were low in and and began to rise steadily in mid year as production cuts by opec and other oil producing countries reduced excess inventory levels 
energy prices remained high until the spring of when these same producers elected to increase production to bring energy prices down to more sustainable levels 
the following table summarizes the average prices of oil and gas during the years ended december   and  and the actual spot prices of oil and gas at march  december  march  oil per barrel gas per mmbtu based on west texas intermediate spot prices for the dates indicated 
based on the nymex henry hub prices for the dates indicated 
another indicator of capital spending is the number of operating drilling rigs 
the average us and international operating rig counts  as published weekly by baker hughes  increased in when compared to the following table summarizes the average us  canadian and international operating rig counts for the years ended december  and december  change us canada international total   the increase in oil prices from to has had a positive effect on our overall sales for as compared to the recent price and rig count improvements have contributed to improved overall industry conditions and should also cause our customers to continue to increase their exploration and development efforts 
although energy price and rig count increases are indicators that additional oil and gas production may occur in  there can be no assurance that overall production will increase  that an increase in production trends will continue through or that such an increase in production would result in an increase in revenues for our company 
the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

partially offsetting this increase was a decline in service revenues of million related to a gas plant operation that was closed in the fourth quarter of affiliated revenues for this business segment were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from our engineered systems business segment for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the contribution of one customer  ctoc  which provided revenues of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the acquisitions of mpe and esi in february and april  respectively  also contributed to the increase in engineered systems revenue 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in other domestic and international engineered systems  consistent with a decrease in project awards by our customers throughout and early as a result of lower natural gas prices in engineered systems revenues of million for the year ended december  included affiliated revenues of  as compared to million of affiliated revenues for the year ended december revenues from our automation and control systems business segment for the year ended december  increased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  despite the completion of several large projects in  revenues for this business segment increased due to stable demand for our automation and controls products and an increase in affiliated revenues from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenues from our natco canada business segment for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was partially due to the acquisition of porta test  which contributed revenues of million for the year ended december   and an increase in affiliated revenues of million associated with large projects  including ctoc 
the natco canada business segment results included two significant gas plant projects for chevron canada and several projects for pemex completed in overall industry market conditions in canada improved  which was consistent with an increase in canadian rig count during affiliated revenue for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the change in revenues for corporate and eliminations represents the elimination of revenues of affiliates as discussed above

selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was largely related to the execution of our business plan and included additional costs associated with the acquisitions of porta test  mpe and esi  increased spending for technology and product development  additional expenses related to being a public company  and continued investment in pre order engineering expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  depreciation expense for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to extending the service life of certain operational assets 
this decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was partially offset by depreciation on the addition of capital assets during the last four quarters  which included renovations and expansions of existing manufacturing plants  technological improvements to management information systems and the purchase of computer hardware and software  and acquisitions of and improvements to other equipment used in the company s business  and depreciation expense due to the inclusion of results from porta test  mpe and esi  acquired during fiscal amortization expense for the year ended december  increased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to amortization of goodwill associated with the porta test  mpe and esi acquisitions 
also  amortization expense increased due to an increase in goodwill related to the acquisition of cynara in november pursuant to the cynara purchase agreement  we issued  shares and  shares of our class b common stock during september and june  respectively  to cynara s former shareholders based upon the achievement of certain performance criteria  and the cost of such shares was recorded as goodwill 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to a reduction of long term debt under our term loan and revolving credit facilities from million at december  to million at december  we retired million of long term debt under our term loan facility during february with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
unusual charges 
unusual charges for the year ended december  were million

we completed our initial public offering on january   and  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we recorded compensation expense for the amount of the note and accrued interest  including related payroll burdens  totaling million 
in addition  we recorded relocation expenses totaling  associated with the consolidation of two facilities following the acquisition of porta test 
revaluation gain on postretirement benefit liability 
in december  we changed our method of accounting for gains and losses on our postretirement benefit obligation 
rather than record gains and losses to the income statement  we now amortize gains or losses that exceed of our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation over the expected remaining lives of the participants 
therefore  we did not record a gain or loss on the revaluation of postretirement benefit liability for the year ended december  during the year ended december   a revaluation gain on postretirement benefit liability of million was recorded due to a change in the actuarial discount rate used to calculate the net present value of the underlying liability 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes  which was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in income tax expense was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from for to for primarily due to the impact of non deductible goodwill expense

generally  increases in raw materials and labor costs are passed on to our customers 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in june sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
we adopted sfas on january   which did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operation because we had no derivative arrangements or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes at december  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are conducted around the world in a number of different countries 
accordingly  future earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
our functional currencies are the primary currencies in which we conduct our business in various jurisdictions 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the canadian dollar  which is the functional currency of natco canada 
because these contracts are denominated and settled in the functional currency  risks associated with currency fluctuations are minimized 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks  and we believe that foreign currency exchange risk is not significant to our operations 
our financial instruments are subject to changes in interest rates  including our revolving credit and term loan facility and our working capital facility for export sales 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the revolving credit and term loan facility 
at december   outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled million 
the revolving credit agreement was amended in october to extend the maturity date of these borrowings from november to january borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate of our borrowings under this credit facility was 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the working capital facility for export sales at december  based on past market movements and possible near term market movements  we do not believe that potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values or cash flows from changes in interest rates are likely to be material 
assuming our current level of borrowings  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates under the borrowings would decrease our current net income and cash flow from operations by less than  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we could take action to mitigate our exposure 
due  however  to the uncertainty of actions that could be taken and the possible effects  this calculation assumes no such actions 
furthermore  this calculation does not consider the effects of a possible change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
