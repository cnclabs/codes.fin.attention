we expect to report losses as we incur charges for the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to these acquisitions 
results of operations we have experienced substantial net losses in the past 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  primarily due to billion of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
revenues the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop sop  as modified  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  or pcs  installation  training  etc 
to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to the vendor 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements of a license agreement and pcs is the only undelivered element  then all revenue for the license arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
revenues from authentication services consist of fees for the issuance of digital certificates  fees for digital certificate service provisioning  fees for technology and business process licensing to affiliates and fees for consulting  implementation  training  support and maintenance services 
each of these sources of revenue has different revenue recognition methods 
revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate  generally months 
revenues from the sale of onsite managed services are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license  generally months 
revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business process technology are sold in arrangements involving multiple elements including pcs  training and other services 
pcs can be renewed annually for an additional fee 
we use the pcs renewal rate as evidence of fair value of pcs 
the company establishes evidence of fair value for training and other services through the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
since we have established evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is recognized under the residual method 
the fair value of pcs is recognized over the pcs term  training and other service revenue is recognized when delivered and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable  and the company has no remaining obligations other than the delivery of pcs 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed fee development arrangements or as the services are provided for time and materials arrangements 
revenues from payment services primarily consist of a set up fee and a monthly service fee for the transaction processing services 
in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues from the set up fee are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned 
revenues from the service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided 
domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services 
revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term  generally two years 
domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services 
we defer revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name registration services and recognize these revenues ratably over the registration term 
we accounted for the june  network solutions acquisition as a purchase and network solutions revenues  which are derived primarily from web presence services  have been included in our results of operations commencing june  in addition  we also acquired thawte and signio in february therefore  comparisons of revenues for the year ended december  to the years ended december  and may not be relevant  as the businesses of the combined company were not equivalent 
a comparison of revenues for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands revenues    the increase in revenues in from is primarily due to the acquisition of thawte  signio and network solutions 
in addition  we increased sales of our authentication services  particularly our website digital certificates and verisign onsite services  expanded our international affiliate network and delivered more training and consulting services 
as of december  we have sold over  website digital certificates  and over  onsite service solutions to enterprises  and we have affiliates in our international network of affiliates 
a small portion of our revenue mix is from payment transaction services provided by signio now verisign payment services 
at december   the customer base for these services had grown to more than  online merchants using our payment services  to payment enable their online stores and business to business commerce activities 
the year ended december  reflects approximately six and one half months of activity from network solutions

revenues increased significantly in from due to higher sales of our internet based trust services  particularly our website digital certificates  affiliate processing and service centers  verisign onsite services  and the delivery of more training and services 
in addition  in  we expanded our international affiliate network and experienced significant growth in international markets 
in  we completed certain work required under various consulting contracts and recognized the related portion of revenues 
there were no significant increases in our per unit prices in compared to or in compared to no customer accounted for or more of revenues in  or revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for of total revenues in  in and in costs and expenses we accounted for all of our acquisitions in as purchase transactions 
accordingly  the acquired companies costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition 
therefore  comparisons of costs and expenses for the year ended december  to the years ended december  and may not be relevant  as the businesses of the combined company were not equivalent 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services  payment services  domain name registration services  customer support and training  consulting and development services and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities 
in addition  with respect to our digital certificate services  cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify certificate applicants identities  insurance premiums for our service warranty plan and errors and omission insurance and the cost of software resold to customers 
a comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands cost of revenues    percentage of revenues growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of revenues in from and in from we hired more employees to support the growth of demand for our products and services during the period and to support the growth of our security consulting and training activities 
we incurred increased expenses for access to third party databases  higher support charges for our external disaster recovery program  increased customer service costs related to our larger customer base and increased expenses related to the cost of software products resold to customers as part of network security solution implementations 
our acquisitions of thawte  signio and network solutions have resulted in an increase in our cost of revenues in over prior years 
future acquisitions  further expansion into international markets and introductions of additional products will result in further increases in cost of revenues  due to additional personnel and related expenses and other factors 
we anticipate that cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of continued growth in all of our lines of business 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased in from and in from primarily due to the continued realization of economies of scale from our technology infrastructure and the efficiency gains in the certificate enrollment and issuance process 
in addition  revenues derived from our recent acquisitions of thawte  signio and network solutions  have a different cost structure from our authentication services 
certain of our services  such as implementation consulting and training  require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types of services 
as a result  we anticipate that cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will vary in future periods depending on the mix of services sold 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales  marketing  and external affair activities 
these expenses include salaries  sales commissions and other personnel related expenses  travel and related expenses  costs of computer and communications equipment and support services  facilities costs  consulting fees and costs of marketing programs  such as internet  television  radio and print advertising 
a comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands sales and marketing    percentage of revenues the network solutions acquisition was the primary reason for the increase in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to the web presence services group continues to incur expenses promoting the value of the

web addresses as well as value added services including web site design tools and other enhanced service offerings 
the remainder of the increase in was driven by lead and demand generation activities in our authentication businesses  expansion of our sales force  an increase in international sales expenses and the effect of sales and marketing expenses from thawte and signio 
sales and marketing expenses increased in from as a result of the continued growth of our direct sales force and the expansion of our marketing efforts  particularly in lead and demand generation activities 
the expansion of our international sales presence in europe during the second half of also contributed to the increase from while the absolute dollar spending increased for sales and marketing expenses  we continue to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues over the three year period 
this is primarily due to the increase in recurring revenues from existing customers  which tend to have lower acquisition costs and the increase in the productivity of our direct sales forces 
however  we cannot forecast that these sales and marketing expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future  primarily related to an expanded sales force  expanded marketing and demand generation activities  development and enhancement of partner and distribution channels and promotional activities for web presence products and services 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel  including salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting fees and the costs of facilities  computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development 
a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of revenues research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in from primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions 
in addition  the increase in from  as well as the increase in from  is also due to continued investment in the design  testing and deployment of  and technical support for our expanded internet trust service offerings and technology 
the increase reflects the expansion of our engineering staff and related costs required to support our continued emphasis on developing new products and services as well as enhancing existing products and services 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues in from and in from is largely due to the fact that revenues increased faster than research and development expenses in these periods 
the decrease in from is also due in part to different cost structures related to our acquisitions we believe that timely development of new and enhanced authentication services  transaction services  web presence services and technology are necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace 
accordingly  we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development 
as a result  we expect research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
to date  we have expensed all research and development expenditures as incurred 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for our executive  administrative  legal  finance and human resources personnel  facilities and computer and communications equipment  support services and professional services fees 
a comparison of general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands general and administrative    percentage of revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was related to the acquisition of network solutions in june and the acquisition of thawte and signio in the first quarter of expenses also increased in from  as well as in from  due to additional staffing levels required to manage and support our expanded operations  the implementation of additional management information systems  and the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in from is primarily due to incremental expenses related to integrating our acquisitions and different cost structures of those acquisitions 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in from is primarily due to the fact that revenues increased faster than general and administrative expenses as we began to experience economies of scale in our corporate infrastructure 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future as we expand our administrative and executive staff  add infrastructure  expand facilities and assimilate acquired technologies and businesses 
write off of acquired in process research and development the portion of the network solutions purchase price allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d  was million and was expensed during the quarter ended june  network solutions ipr d efforts focused on significant and substantial improvements and upgrades to its shared registration system  or srs 
the srs is the system that provides shared registration interface to the accredited and licensed registrars into the 
com  
net  and 
org top level domain  or tld  name registry 
it is through this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain names with the central database 
given the high demand on the srs  it is in need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability  security  non english language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol 
as of the acquisition date  network solutions was in the process of developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to the srs 
the ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the ipr d under development may not achieve technical or commercial viability 
the technological feasibility of the in process development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
as of december   the development efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the srs and other systems are ongoing and expected to be completed by march the fair value assigned to ipr d was estimated by discounting  to present value  the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility 
a discount rate of was used to estimate the present value of cash flows 
the value assigned to ipr d was the amount attributable to the efforts of network solutions up to the time of acquisition 
this amount was estimated through application of the stage of completion calculation by multiplying the estimated present value of future cash flows  excluding costs of completion  by the percentage of completion of the purchased research and development project at the time of acquisition 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets resulted primarily from our acquisitions of thawte and signio in february  network solutions in june and other individually insignificant acquisitions in we expect to recognize goodwill and other intangible asset amortization charges related to these acquisitions of up to billion per quarter until the goodwill and other intangible asset balances from these acquisitions become fully amortized which we currently anticipate ending in in addition  in the event we complete future acquisitions  we expect to incur additional goodwill and other intangible asset amortization charges 
special charges in connection with our acquisition of secureit  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests  we recorded a special charge of million to operating expenses in the third quarter of the expenses included million for direct and other merger related costs pertaining to the merger transaction 
merger transaction costs consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  filing fees and other related charges 
the remaining million related to stock based compensation charges in connection with the acceleration of certain performance stock options held by secureit employees 
other income other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments and gains on sale of equity investments  as well as the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
other income also includes charges for any gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment and other miscellaneous expenses 
a comparison of other income for the years ended december   and is presented below 
change change dollars in thousands other income    percentage of revenues the increase in other income in from is primarily due to increased earnings on funds invested 
investments have increased in part due to our net proceeds of million generated from the follow on public offering of our common stock during january and investment of cash generated from operations 
the investment base was also significantly increased through the acquisition of network solutions  which added over million of cash and investments 
the increase in over was also due to a million gain from the sale of shares of keynote systems  inc we may from time to time derive gains from the sales of our equity investments although due to current market conditions  we do not expect any such gains to be material in amount 
provision for income taxes we have not recorded any provision for federal and state income taxes because we have experienced an accumulated deficit since inception 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to stock compensation expense and million related to continuing operations 
we also had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to stock compensation expense and million related to continuing operations 
if we are not able to use them  the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership change 
we do not anticipate that any material limitation exists on our ability to use our carryforwards and credits 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on the remaining deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods  our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence 
the current year increase to the valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets which arose as the result of ongoing operations 
accordingly  the reversal of this year s incremental increase to the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit 
the remaining valuation allowance relates to stock option exercises 
reversal of the valuation allowance related to stock option exercises will result in a credit to additional paid in capital and will not result in future income statement benefit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary minority interest in the net income loss of verisign japan kk was million in  
million in and million in the year to year changes are primarily due to verisign japan s increased revenue as compared to the prior years 
as the verisign japan business continues to develop and evolve  we expect that the minority interest in net income loss of subsidiary will fluctuate 
liquidity and capital resources change dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments   working capital   stockholders equity   prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations primarily through private sales of equity securities  raising approximately million 
our initial public offering  which we completed in january  yielded net proceeds of approximately million on the sale of million shares of common stock 
in january  we sold an additional million shares of common stock to the public for net proceeds of approximately million 
the acquisition of network solutions added an additional million of liquidity 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was billion of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  consisting principally of commercial paper  medium term corporate notes  corporate bonds and notes  market auction securities  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in addition  we hold million of long term equity minority investments and corporate debt securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in the increase was primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustment for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and the write off of in process research and development  an overall increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  refundable taxes and our deferred revenue balance in which we receive payment in advance for many of our products and services 
in  cash used for operating activities was million that was primarily the result of net losses and an increase in accounts receivable 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  primarily as a result of the cash acquired in our acquisitions  partially offset by increased purchases of short and long term investments  and costs relating to our acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in in  net cash used in investing activities primarily related to net purchases of investments 
in  net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of capital expenditures for property and equipment and net purchases of investments 
capital expenditures for property and equipment totaled million in  million in and million in our planned capital expenditures for are approximately million to million  primarily for computer and communications equipment and leasehold improvements 
as of december   we also had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  cash was provided primarily from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises 
in  we received net cash proceeds of million from the public offering of our stock and in  we received net cash proceeds of million from our initial public offering 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and operating cash flows  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  at some time  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
this additional funding  if needed  might not be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of our stock owned by our then current stockholders will be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  historically  the company has not entered into derivatives contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
adoption of the new standard will not have a material affect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of verisign s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  market auction securities  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
in addition  we generally invest in relatively short term securities 
as of december   of our non strategic investments mature in less than one year 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in six months six months to one more than estimated or less year one year total fair value dollars in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents    weighted average interest rate included in short term investments     weighted average interest rate included in long term investments    weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity verisign considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
all revenues derived from affiliates other than verisign japan and thawte consulting are denominated in united states dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
both the revenues and expenses of our majority owned subsidiary in japan are denominated in japanese yen  and the revenues and expenses of our activities conducted through south africa are denominated in south african rand 
in both regions  we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the united states dollar will result in lower revenues when translated to united states dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
our subsidiary in sweden has not had significant operations to date 
because of our minimal exposure to foreign currencies  we have not engaged in any hedging transactions to date 
equity price risk we own shares of common stock of several public companies 
we value these investments using the closing fair market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments in our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
as a result of recent market price volatility of our publicly traded investments  we experienced a million unrealized loss  net of tax on these investments during in addition  we have invested in equity instruments of several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are accounted for under the cost method 
we do not hedge against equity price changes 
intangible asset risk we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although at december  we believe our intangible assets are recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their consequent effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
