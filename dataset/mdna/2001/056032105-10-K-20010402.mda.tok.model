item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  sell and support advanced thermal processing systems used primarily in the assembly of pcbs and in advanced semiconductor packaging 
we believe we are the leading supplier of solder reflow systems used by oems and ems providers 
in addition  we produce advanced high temperature processing systems for manufacturing ceramic components for electronic devices and a variety of specialty applications 
we derive our net sales from customers around the world 
our customers include large multinational oems and ems providers requiring advanced thermal processing equipment solutions 
in  net sales to our five largest customers accounted for of our total net sales

we do not presently have any outstanding commitments for capital expenditures that would have a material impact on our liquidity and future capital resources 
we expect that our current cash position  ability to borrow necessary funds and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our corporate  operating and capital requirements into market risk disclosure our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations as they pertain to invoices for parts and labor in our foreign service locations

recent accounting developments in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides additional guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles for revenue recognition to a company s consolidated financial statements 
sab no 
addresses several issues  including the timing for recognizing revenue derived from arrangements that provide for customer acceptance or product installation after shipment and transfer of title 
prior to  the company generally recognized revenues upon shipment of its products 
during the fourth quarter of  effective as of january   the company adopted securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
under sab no 
 when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer use  revenues are recognized upon acceptance 
revenues for products that require installation for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon shipment with estimated installation and warranty costs accrued the adoption of sab no 
had no impact on the company s previously recorded revenue 
applying the requirements of sab no 
to future sales arrangements used in the company s thermal processing equipment sales may result in the deferral of the revenue for some equipment sales 
the company continues to evaluate the impact that sab no 
might have on its sales transactions 
however  there will be no impact on the company s cash flows from operations as a result of this change

in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs which provides guidance on income statement classification of shipping and handling costs incurred by companies which is subsequently billed to customers 
companies have recorded these types of costs inconsistently in the income statement

additionally  the guidance gives companies the option to reflect the associated shipping and handling costs in either cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs represent amounts incurred to physically move the product from the company to the customer s desired location
