item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto beginning on page f of this annual report 
overview we are the second largest automotive retailer in the united states  as measured by total revenue  operating dealership franchises and collision repair centers throughout the united states as of march  we own and operate franchises for different brands of cars and light trucks  providing comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  replacement parts and vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services 
we also arrange extended warranty contracts and financing and insurance for our automotive customers 
the following table depicts the breakdown of our new vehicle revenues by brand for each of the past three years percentage of new vehicle revenues for the year ended december  brand honda ford chrysler bmw general motors toyota nissan lexus other total includes chrysler  dodge  jeep and plymouth includes buick  cadillac  chevrolet  gmc  oldsmobile and pontiac includes acura  audi  hyundai  infiniti  isuzu  kia  land rover  lincoln  mercedes  mercury  mitsubishi  porsche  subaru  volkswagen and volvo new vehicle revenues include both the sale and lease of new vehicles 
used vehicle revenues include amounts received for used vehicles sold to retail customers  other dealers and wholesalers 
other operating revenues include parts and services revenues  fees and commissions for arranging financing and insurance and sales of third party extended warranties for vehicles 
in connection with vehicle financing contracts  we receive a finance fee from the lender for originating the loan 
if  within days of origination  the customer pays off the loans through refinancing or selling trading in the vehicle or defaults on the loan  the finance company will assess a charge a chargeback for a portion of the original commission 
the amount of the chargeback depends on how long the related loan was outstanding 
as a result  we have established reserves based on our historical chargeback experience 
we also sell warranties provided by third party vendors  and recognize a commission at the time of sale 
the automobile industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns  characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
many factors affect the industry including general economic conditions and consumer confidence  the level of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit 
during the fourth quarter of  we saw a rapid slowdown in the new vehicle sales of domestic manufacturer brands as a result of these factors 
this caused many of our dealerships to have excess new vehicle inventory and to overspend on advertising and promotional programs 
as a result of this slowdown in the new vehicle market  our new vehicle revenue declined by approximately on a same store basis in the fourth quarter of we expect this slowdown in domestic new vehicle sales to continue into the first quarter of while used vehicle sales are affected by the same factors as new vehicle sales  generally a slowdown in new vehicle sales does not necessarily indicate a similar slowdown in used vehicle sales due to limited comparability among used vehicles and the subjective nature of their valuation 
in the fourth quarter of  our used vehicle revenues declined less than on a same store basis 
while the automotive retailing business is cyclical  we sell several products and services that are not closely tied to the sale of new and used vehicles 
such products and services include our parts  service and collision repair businesses  none of which are dependent upon near term new vehicle sales volume 
our cost of sales and profitability are also affected by the allocations of new vehicles which our dealerships receive from manufacturers 
when we do not receive allocations of new vehicle models adequate to meet customer demand  we may purchase additional vehicles from other dealers at a premium to the manufacturer s invoice  reducing the gross margin realized on the sales of such vehicles 
in addition  we follow a disciplined approach in selling vehicles to other dealers and wholesalers when the vehicles have been in our inventory longer than the guidelines set by us 
such sales are frequently at or below cost and  therefore  reduce our overall gross margin on vehicle sales 
salary expense  employee benefits costs  facility rent and advertising expenses comprise the majority of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
approximately of our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were variable 
we are able to adjust these expenses as the operating or economic environment impacting our dealerships changes 
we manage these variable expenses  such as advertising of selling  general and administrative expenses and non salaried sales compensation expenses  so that they are generally related to vehicle sales and can be adjusted in response to changes in vehicle sales volume 
in addition  management compensation is tied to individual dealership profitability and stock price appreciation through stock options 
interest expense fluctuates based primarily on the level of the inventory of new vehicles held at our dealerships  substantially all of which is financed through floor plan financing  as well as the amount of indebtedness incurred for acquisitions 
our floor plan expenses are substantially offset by amounts received from manufacturers  in the form of floor plan inventory incentives 
these payments are credited against our cost of sales 
in  we received approximately million in manufacturer inventory incentives which resulted in an effective borrowing rate under our floor plan facilities of approximately 
our business is fundamentally managed based on individual dealership operating performance 
each of our dealerships have similar economic and operating characteristics 
each dealership sells similar products and services new and used vehicles  parts  service and collision repair services  uses similar processes in selling its products and services  and sells its products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result  we have aggregated our dealerships into a single operating segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
we have accounted for all of our dealership acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  we do not include in our financial statements the results of operations of these dealerships prior to the date they were acquired 
our consolidated financial statements discussed below reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of each of our dealerships acquired prior to december  as a result of the effects of our acquisitions  the historical consolidated financial information described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows which would have resulted had such acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented  nor is it indicative of future results of operations  financial position and cash flows

interest expense  other increased million in due primarily to interest incurred on the million of senior subordinated notes we issued on july  and on additional borrowings under our revolving facility 
this increase in interest expense  other was partially offset by the capitalization of million of interest costs on construction projects 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in compared to in and in the decrease from to was primarily attributable to the realization of the benefits of certain tax planning strategies  offset somewhat by acquisitions we made in the latter part of which were either companies operating in states with higher income tax rates  or stock purchases in which the goodwill amortization is not deductible for income tax purposes 
the increase in from was also primarily attributable to acquisitions which were either companies operating in states with higher income tax rates  or stock purchases in which the goodwill amortization is not deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
historically  we have relied on internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our various credit facilities  and offerings of debt and equity securities to finance our operations and expansion 
cash from operations during  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million compared to million in and million in the increases each year were primarily due to increases in net income 
cash flows from operations include the effect of vehicle purchases and related floor plan financing 
we currently have standardized floor plan credit facilities with chrysler financial  general motors acceptance corporation gmac and ford motor credit 
the floor plan credit facility with chrysler financial provides up to million for the purchase of vehicles at our chrysler dealerships 
the floor plan credit facility with gmac  which was obtained on june   provides for the purchase of vehicles at nine of our general motors dealerships 
the floor plan facility with ford motor credit provides up to million for the purchase of vehicles at all of our other dealerships 
as of december   there was an aggregate of approximately million outstanding under the chrysler financial floor plan facility  million outstanding under the gmac floor plan facility and million outstanding under the ford motor credit floor plan facility 
balances outstanding under new vehicle floor plan indebtedness generally exceed the related inventory balances  which are generally reduced by purchase discounts from manufacturers that are not reflected in the related floor plan liability 
these manufacturer purchase discounts are standard in the automotive retail industry  typically occur on all new vehicle purchases and are not used to offset the related floor plan liability 
these discounts are aggregated and generally paid to us by the manufacturers on a quarterly basis 
amounts outstanding under the chrysler financial floor plan facility bear interest at above libor libor was at december  
amounts outstanding under the ford motor credit and gmac floor plan facilities bear interest at prime rate prime was at december   subject to certain incentives and other adjustments 
interest payments under each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly  but we are not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 
the underlying notes are due when the related vehicles are sold and are collateralized by vehicle inventories and other assets  excluding franchise agreements  of the relevant dealership subsidiary 
the floor plan facilities contain a number of covenants  including among others  covenants restricting us with respect to the creation of liens and changes in ownership  officers and key management personnel 
we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december investing activities cash used for investing activities in was approximately million  compared to million in and million in our principal investing activities include capital expenditures and dealership acquisitions 
capital expenditures other than construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers  our capital expenditures generally include building improvements and equipment for use in our dealerships 
capital expenditures in were approximately million  compared to million in and million in the year over year increases primarily represent expenditures for the construction and renovation of dealerships and collision repair centers 
of the capital expenditures in  approximately million related to the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers compared to million for similar expenditures in once completed  these new dealerships and collision repair centers are generally sold to third parties in sale leaseback transactions 
we sold million of completed construction projects in sale leaseback transactions in and million in there were no material gains or losses on these sales 
in addition  in we sold real estate at two of our existing dealerships in sale leaseback transactions for approximately million 
we recognized a gain of approximately million which was deferred and is being amortized against rent expense over the term of the lease 
as of december   total construction in progress was approximately million  of which approximately million represented construction costs on facilities which are expected to be completed and sold within one year in sale leaseback transactions 
accordingly  these costs have been classified in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we do not expect any significant gains or losses from these sales

current assets to current liabilities at least  
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and rent  less capital expenditures  to fixed charges at least  
ebitda to interest expense at least and 
total adjusted debt to ebitda no greater than 
in addition  the loss of voting control over sonic by bruton smith  chairman and chief executive officer  scott smith  president and chief operating officer  and their spouses or immediate family members or our failure  with certain exceptions  to own all the outstanding equity  membership or partnership interests in our dealership subsidiaries will constitute an event of default under the revolving facility 
we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  the mortgage facility in june  we entered into a revolving real estate acquisition and construction line of credit the construction loan and a related mortgage refinancing facility the permanent loan and together with the construction loan  the mortgage facility with ford motor credit 
under the construction loan  our dealership development subsidiaries can borrow up to million to finance land acquisition and dealership construction costs

the total outstanding balance under the construction loan as of december  was approximately million 
under the permanent loan  we can refinance up to million in advances under the construction loan once the projects are completed 
advances can be made under the permanent loan until june all advances under the permanent loan mature on june   bear interest at above libor and are secured by the same collateral given under the construction loan 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the permanent loan 
the mortgage facility allows us to borrow up to million in the aggregate under the construction loan and the permanent loan 
the mortgage facility is not cross collateralized with the revolving facility  however  a default under one will cause a default under the other 
among other customary covenants  the borrowing subsidiaries under the mortgage facility agreed not to incur any other liens on their property except for existing encumbrances on property acquired and not to transfer their property or more than of their ownership interests to any third party 
in addition  the loss of voting control over sonic by bruton smith  scott smith and their spouses or immediate family members  with certain exceptions  will result in an event of default under the mortgage facility 
sonic was in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  the senior subordinated notes due we currently have an aggregate principal balance of million in senior subordinated notes outstanding which mature on august  and bear interest at a stated rate of 
the notes are unsecured and are redeemable at our option after august  interest payments are due semi annually on august and february and commenced february  the notes are subordinated to all of our present and future senior indebtedness  including the revolving facility 
redemption prices during month periods beginning august are in  in  in and thereafter 
the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contains certain specified restrictive and required financial covenants 
we have agreed not to pledge our assets to any third party except under certain limited circumstances for example  floor plan indebtedness

through march   we have repurchased approximately  million shares of class a common stock for approximately million and have redeemed  shares of class a convertible preferred stock for approximately million 
we will continue to repurchase shares from time to time subject to market conditions 
we believe that funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our floor plan financing or any replacements thereof and other credit arrangements will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the foreseeable future 
we expect to fund any future acquisitions from future cash flow from operations  additional debt financing including the revolving facility or the issuance of class a common stock  preferred stock or other convertible instruments 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first quarter generally contributes less revenue and operating profits than the second  third and fourth quarters 
seasonality is principally caused by weather conditions and the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers 
significant materiality of goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets acquired 
the cumulative gross goodwill balance was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  as a percentage of total assets and stockholders equity  goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  represented and  respectively  at december   and and  respectively  at december  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america require that goodwill and all other intangible assets be amortized over the period benefited 
we have determined that the period benefited by the goodwill will be no less than years 
accordingly  we are amortizing goodwill over a year period 
earnings reported in periods immediately following an acquisition would be overstated if we attributed a year benefit to an intangible asset that should have had a shorter benefit period 
in later years  we would be burdened by a continuing charge against earnings without the associated benefit to income valued by management in arriving at the consideration paid for the businesses acquired 
earnings in later years also could be significantly affected if management then determined that the remaining balance of goodwill was impaired 
we periodically compare the carrying value of goodwill with the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations of the business we have acquired in order to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill 
we have concluded that the anticipated future cash flows associated with intangible assets recognized in our acquisitions will continue indefinitely  and there is no pervasive evidence that any material portion will dissipate over a period shorter than years 
we will incur additional goodwill in future acquisitions 
the financial accounting standards board recently proposed new rules relating to the accounting for business combinations and intangible assets 
one aspect of the proposal would not permit amortization of goodwill  but would require the carrying amount of goodwill to be reduced only if it was found to be impaired or was associated with assets to be sold or otherwise disposed 
if the proposed rules are adopted  goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to the date of adoption would no longer be amortized  though reversal of goodwill amortization recognized in prior periods would not be permitted 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our variable rate floor plan notes payable  revolving credit facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the underlying interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such instruments was approximately billion at december  and approximately million at december  a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in and approximately million in of the total change in interest expense  approximately million in and approximately million in would have resulted from floor plan notes payable 
our exposure with respect to floor plan notes payable is mitigated by floor plan incentives received from manufacturers which are generally based on rates similar to those incurred under our floor plan financing arrangements 
our floor plan interest expense in exceeded the amounts we received from these manufacturer floor plan incentives by only approximately million 
as a result  the effective rate incurred under our floor plan financing arrangements was reduced to an annualized rate of approximately after considering these incentives
