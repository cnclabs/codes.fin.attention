item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture  market and sell a range of solar electric power generation products  including solar cells  modules  panels and our sunchoicetm pre packaged systems for the global marketplace 
solar cells are the core component inside every solar electric power system 
our products provide an environmentally friendly  reliable energy solution at the point of use and are sold for both off grid and on grid applications 
in off grid applications  our products provide the primary source of electric power for rural homes and villages and supply power for equipment in the telecommunications and transportation industries 
in on grid applications  our products provide a renewable source of alternative or supplemental electric power and provide reliable back up power in the event of a utility outage 
in addition to our solar power generation product offerings  we sell wholesale solar electric power under long term purchase agreements through a joint venture with gpu international  inc we currently generate product revenues from the sale of solar cells  modules  panels and pre packaged systems 
while the predominant source of our product revenues to date has been recycled wafer products  we are continuing a significant expansion of our silicon filmtm manufacturing capacity 
we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment 
product sales represented of total revenues for the year ended december  solar cell prices and manufacturing costs vary depending upon supply and demand in the market for solar cells and modules  order size  yields  the costs of raw materials  particularly reclaimed silicon wafers recycled from the semiconductor industry  and other factors 
we also generate revenue from contracts with various federal government agencies to conduct research on advanced silicon filmtm products and optoelectronic devices 
generally  these contracts last from six months to three years 
we recognize research contract revenue at the time costs benefiting the contracts are incurred  which approximates the percentage of completion method 
for the year ended december   of our product revenues were generated by sales to customers located outside of the united states 
we believe that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our product sales for the foreseeable future 
current sales are denominated in us dollars and foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had an impact on our results of operations 
solar cells that we manufacture are sold to original equipment manufacturers that assemble the solar cells into modules 
in addition  we assemble and sell modules to distributors and value added resellers 
we have also begun to sell our sunchoicetm systems 
the sale of modules and systems results in substantially more revenue to us than the sale of solar cells due to the incremental value of the additional materials  labor and overhead 
accordingly  our product sales are affected not just by changes in total solar cells produced  but by changes in the sales mix among solar cells  modules and systems 
the gross margin percentages for modules and systems are generally less than those of solar cells 
as a result  changes in the product sales mix may also affect total product gross margin 
substantially all of our revenues from government contracts are subject to audit under various federal statutes 
we have been in a dispute about indirect cost rates with the government since and have  to date  been unable to resolve our differences 
in october  the united states government filed a civil action against us in the us district court for the district of delaware  to recover damages and penalties with respect to the submission of invoices and incurred cost submissions in connection with contracts with the us department of defense and us department of energy 
the allegations in the complaint involve our incurred cost submissions  which are used to determine indirect cost rates  for the period from through  and invoices submitted between july and january the government had previously audited and accepted our indirect cost rate structure for through the complaint alleges that we falsely claimed that certain costs were properly allocable to the government contracts when those costs were attributable to a commercial venture  resulting in overpayments to us of at least million and seeks treble damages and penalties aggregating approximately million 
our proposed final indirect cost rates for have been submitted but have not yet been audited 
this dispute does not affect our indirect cost rates for  and  inasmuch as we revised our methodology for determining those rates 
this action is in the early procedural stages 
although a scheduling order has been issued with a trial scheduled to begin in march  we cannot predict when this action will be finally resolved 
we disagree with the allegations in the complaint and believe that we have valid defenses to the government s claims 
we are defending this action vigorously 
however  because litigation is subject to uncertainties  it is not possible for us to predict the outcome of this action 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows in the period in which this action is resolved  but we do not expect that an unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
in addition  defending this action may be costly

we expect that our available cash balance  together with our projected cash generated from operations and available bank credit lines will be sufficient to fund our activities for at least the next two years 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america as well as in the europe and asia pacific and africa regions 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because all of our revenues are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is not a material risk exposure
