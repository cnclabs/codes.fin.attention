the property operating income from summit deerfield represented less than one percent of property operating income for the company for the year ended december  proceeds from the sale of summit deerfield are expected to be used to fund future development 
development activity the company s developments in process at december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands total estimated anticipated apartment estimated cost to cost to construction community homes costs date complete completion summit deerfield cincinnati  oh    q summit overlook raleigh  nc    q summit crest raleigh  nc    q summit peachtree city atlanta  ga    q summit grand parc washington  dc    q summit brookwood atlanta  ga    q summit valley brook philadelphia  pa    q other development and construction costs  these communities were in lease up at december  consists primarily of land held for development and other pre development costs 
summit deerfield is under contract for sale expected in as a part of the company s strategy to exit the midwest market 
the company does not expect to incur a loss upon the sale of summit deerfield 
estimated cost to complete the development communities of approximately million represents substantially all of the company s material commitments for capital expenditures at december  certain factors affecting the performance of development communities the company is optimistic about the operating prospects of the communities under construction 
as with any development community  there are uncertainties and risks associated with the development of the communities described above 
while the company has prepared development budgets and has estimated completion and stabilization target dates based on what it believes are reasonable assumptions in light of current conditions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that the company will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of materials  weather conditions or other events 
other development risks include the possibility of incurring additional costs or liabilities resulting from increased costs for materials or labor or other unexpected costs or defects in construction material  and the possibility that financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  to pursue or complete development activities 
similarly  market conditions at the time these communities become available for leasing will affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period of time necessary to achieve stabilization  which could make one or more of the development communities unprofitable or result in achieving stabilization later than currently anticipated 
in addition  the company is conducting feasibility and other pre development work for ten communities 
the company could abandon the development of any one or more of these potential communities in the event that it determines that market conditions do not support development  financing is not available on favorable terms  or it is unable to obtain necessary permits and authorizations  or due to other circumstances which may prevent development 
similarly  there can be no assurance that  if the company does pursue one or more of these potential communities  that it will be able to complete construction within the currently estimated development budgets or that construction can be started at the time currently anticipated 
americans with disabilities act and similar laws under the americans with disabilities act  all places of public accommodation are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
the company believes that its communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements of the americans with disabilities act as they apply to multifamily dwellings 
a number of additional federal  state and local laws exist or may be imposed which also may require modifications to the company s communities or regulate certain further renovations with respect to access by disabled persons 
the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act or related legislation is not currently ascertainable  and while these costs are not expected to have a material effect on the company  they could be substantial 
limitations or restrictions on the completion of certain renovations may limit application of the company s investment strategy in particular instances or reduce overall returns on its investments 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations recurring capital expenditures 
the company s methodology for calculating ffo and fad may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo and fad utilized by other real estate companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to other real estate companies 
ffo and fad do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital expenditures or expansion  debt service obligations  property acquisitions  development  dividends and distributions or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and fad should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make dividends distributions 
the company believes ffo and fad are helpful to investors as measures of the performance of the company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors with an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution are calculated as follows dollars in thousands net income    extraordinary items  net of minority interest extraordinary items management company minority interest of unitholders in operating partnership    gain on sale of real estate assets    gain on sale of real estate assets management company adjusted net income    depreciation real estate assets    real estate joint ventures  funds from operations    recurring capital expenditures    funds available for distribution    non recurring capital expenditures    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares and units outstanding basic    weighted average shares and units outstanding diluted    recurring capital expenditures are expected to be funded from operations and consist primarily of exterior painting   new appliances  vinyl  blinds  tile  wallpaper and carpets in and in contrast  non recurring capital expenditures  such as major improvements  new garages and access gates  are expected to be funded by financing activities and are  therefore  not included in the calculation of funds available for distribution 
the increase in recurring capital expenditures for the year ended december  was primarily due to the company s change in accounting policy to capitalize carpets starting january  without carpet  recurring capital expenditures for the years ended december  and would have been million and million  respectively 
recurring capital expenditures for have not been restated for the change in accounting policy 
non recurring capital expenditures for the years ended december  and primarily consisted of major renovations in the amounts of  in and million in  respectively   and  for access gates and security fences in and  respectively   for water meters in  and million and million in other revenue enhancement expenditures in and  respectively 
recently enacted legislation the company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended

effective for tax years beginning after december   a reit may own the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary without limitation on the reit s voting control over the subsidiary  provided that not more than of the value of the reit s total assets is represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
a taxable reit subsidiary would include a corporation in which the company directly or indirectly owns stock and which has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary 
in  the management company will elect to become a taxable reit subsidiary in accordance with the new legislation 
as a result of this election  the company s investment in the management company will be recorded on a consolidated basis 
in addition  effective for tax years beginning after december   the recently enacted tax legislation reduces the percent of real estate investment trust taxable income that must be distributed by the company to its stockholders from to  exclusive of net capital gains
