overview we are a growing provider of telecommunications services to residential and business customers located primarily in north carolina 
we offer an integrated package of telecommunications services consisting of local and long distance telephone services  internet and data services  and digital wireless products and services 
we have worked to expand our ilec business in recent years by adding additional telecommunications services to our integrated service packages  emphasizing customer service and taking advantage of the strong demographic growth in our service area 
another key component to our business strategy is to grow our clec  internet and data services  and digital wireless businesses 
we significantly expanded our internet and data services in may through our acquisition of vnet and further expanded in september and in february through our acquisitions of catawba valley internet partnership and internet of concord 
in december  we acquired webserve  a charlotte  nc based web design and hosting company 
webserve will provide additional capabilities in programming and web design that should complement our existing products and services 
we devoted substantial effort in the past three years to developing business plans  enhancing our management team and board of directors  and designing and developing our business support and operating systems 
development of these areas has required significant investment of capital and start up expenses 
we believe that through these investments  we are positioning ourselves to achieve our strategic objectives
