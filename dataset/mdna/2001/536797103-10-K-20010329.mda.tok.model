lithia has relie d primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings unde r its credit facilities and the proceeds from public equity offerings to financ e its operations and expansion 
in june  lithia s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up t o  shares of lithia s class a common stock 
lithia has purchased share s under this program and may continue to do so from time to time in the future a s conditions warrant 
in december  lithia s existing credit facility with ford credit wa s increased by million to a total of million and the expiration date wa s extended to november with interest due monthly 
the facility includes million for new and program vehicle flooring  million for used vehicl e flooring  million for franchise acquisitions and million in mortgag e financing 
lithia also has the option to convert the acquisition line into a five year term loan

the other ne w vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant stores 
the ford credit lines of credit contain financial covenants requiring lithia t o maintain compliance with  among other things  specified ratios of i total deb t to tangible base capital  ii total adjusted debt to tangible base capital iii current ratio  iv fixed charge coverage  and v net cash 
the for d credit lines of credit agreements also preclude the payment of cash dividend s without the prior consent of ford credit

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  lithia s sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters o f each year largely due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holida y season 
as a result  financial performance may be lower during the first an d fourth quarters than during the other quarters of each fiscal year 
managemen t believes that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer buying pattern s and confidence  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute t o fluctuations in sales and operating results 
the timing of acquisitions ma y cause substantial fluctuations of operating results from quarter to quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lithia has variable rate floor plan notes payable and other credit lin e borrowings that subject it to market risk exposure 
at december  lithi a had million outstanding under such facilities at interest rates rangin g from to per annum 
an increase or decrease in the interest rates woul d affect interest expense for the period accordingly 
in order to reduce the variability of interest payments  lithia has fixed a portion of its interest expense by utilizing interest rate swaps as follows o effective september   lithia entered into a five year  million interest rate swap with us bank dealer commercial services a t a fixed rate of per annum 
o effective november  lithia entered into a three year  million interest rate swap with us bank dealer commercial services a t a fixed rate of per annum 
lithia earns interest on both of the million interest rate swaps at the on e month libor rate adjusted on the first and sixteenth of every month and i s obligated to pay interest at the fixed rate set for each swap or per annum on the same amount 
the difference between interest earned and th e interest obligation accrued is received or paid each month and is recorded i n the statement of operations as interest income or interest expense 
the on e month libor rate at december  was per annum 
the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and the amount of hedging losse s deferred on interest rate swaps was  at december  as of decembe r   approximately of lithia s total debt outstanding was subject t o un hedged variable rates of interest 
as a result  recent interest rate decline s have resulted in a net reduction of lithia s interest expense 
the compan y intends to continue to gradually hedge its interest rate exposure if marke t rates continue to decline
