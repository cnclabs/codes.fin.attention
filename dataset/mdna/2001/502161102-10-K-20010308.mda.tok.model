we expect first quarter gross profit margin to be approximately 
the gross profit margin percentage for decreased to from in on a consolidated basis 
the gross profit margin percentage for the semiconductor segment was in compared to in the decrease primarily reflected a combination of the following factors increased cost of revenues from commencing operations at our fabrication facility in gresham  oregon in december of  lower average selling prices of products used in certain semiconductor product applications  including the impact from currency fluctuations  and changes in product mix primarily related to symbios product additions from august  the gross profit margin percentage for the san systems segment was relatively flat at in compared to in our operating environment  combined with the resources required to operate in the semiconductor industry  requires that we manage a variety of factors 
these factors include  among other things product mix  factory capacity and utilization  manufacturing yields  availability of certain raw materials  terms negotiated with third party subcontractors  and foreign currency fluctuations 
these and other factors could have a significant effect on our gross profit margin in future periods 
changes in the relative strength of the yen may have a greater impact on our gross profit margin than other foreign exchange fluctuations due to our wafer fabrication operations in japan 
although the yen strengthened the average yen exchange rate for appreciated from  the effect on gross profit margin and net income was not significant because yen denominated sales offset a substantial portion of yen denominated costs during the period 
moreover  we hedged a portion of our remaining yen exposure 
see note of the notes 
future changes in the relative strength of the yen or mix of foreign denominated revenues and costs could have a significant effect on our gross profit margin or operating results

we applied a royalty charge of to operating income for each in process project to attribute value for dependency on predecessor core technologies 
the discount rate used in discounting the net cash flows from the ipr d projects back to their present value was for semiconductor and for storage systems  a basis point increase from the respective industry weighted average cost of capital 
the industry weighted average cost of capital was approximately for semiconductors and for storage systems 
we applied the discount rates higher than the industry weighted average cost of capital due to inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances  which could potentially impact the estimates described above 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined using milestones representing management s estimate of effort  value added  and degree of difficulty of the portion of each project completed as of august   as compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring each project to technical feasibility 
the development process was grouped into three phases  with each phase containing between one and five milestones 
the three phases were researching the market requirements and the engineering architecture and feasibility studies  design and verification  and prototyping and testing the product both internal and customer testing 
each of these phases was subdivided into milestones  and then the status of each of the projects was evaluated as of august  we estimated  as of the acquisition date  the storage projects in aggregate were approximately complete and the aggregate costs to complete were million million in  million in and million in 
we estimated the semiconductor projects were approximately complete for client server products and complete for asic and peripheral products 
as of the acquisition date  we expected the cost to complete all semiconductor products to be approximately million million in  million in and million in 
the actual development timeline and costs were in line with estimates as of december  restructuring of operations and other non recurring items 
we recorded restructuring of operations and other non recurring net charges of million in the net charges reflected the combination of the following on february   we entered into an agreement with a third party to outsource certain testing services presently performed by us at our fremont  california facility 
the agreement provides for the sale and transfer of certain test equipment and related peripherals for total proceeds of approximately million 
we recorded a loss of approximately million associated with the agreement 
see note of the notes 
in march  we recorded approximately million of non cash compensation related expenses resulting from a separation agreement entered into during the quarter with a former employee and a million benefit for the reversal of reserves established in the second quarter of for merger related expenses in connection with the merger with seeq technology  inc seeq discussed below 
we recorded restructuring of operations and other non recurring net benefits of million in the net benefit reflected the combination of the following approximately million in restructuring charges and million in merger related expenses associated in connection with the merger with seeq on june  see note of the notes  which included million in merger expenses recorded by seeq in the first quarter of the merger expenses related primarily to investment banking and other professional fees directly attributable to the merger with seeq 
the restructuring charge was comprised of million in write downs of fixed assets that were duplicative to the combined company  million of exit costs relating to non cancelable building lease contracts and a million provision for severance costs related to the involuntary termination of certain employees 
the exit costs and employee severance costs were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the fixed and other asset write downs were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the restructuring actions as outlined by the restructuring plan were completed by june   one year from the date the reserve was taken 
approximately million of restructuring reserve reversals associated with a change in management estimate 
see note of the notes 
the amount consisted of the following million of reserves for lease termination and non cancelable purchase commitments primarily in the us and europe  million of excess severance reserves in the us  japan  and europe  million of reserves for manufacturing facility decommissioning costs and other exit costs primarily in the us and japan  and million of related cumulative translation adjustments 
the change in management estimates of the reserve requirements stemmed primarily from the following factors a significant increase in the requirement for manufacturing capacity to meet expected sales growth  which resulted in retention of certain employees originally targeted for termination of employment and in reversal of the reserve for decommissioning costs as a result of retention of the us and japan operations facilities originally targeted for sale  and our ability to exit lease commitments and non cancelable purchase commitments more favorably than originally anticipated in the us and europe 
description of restructuring 
as a result of identifying opportunities to streamline operations and maximize the integration of symbios into our operations  our management  with the approval of the board of directors  committed to a plan of action and recorded a million restructuring charge in the third quarter of see note of the notes 
the action undertaken included the following elements worldwide realignment of manufacturing capacity  consolidation of certain design centers  sales facilities and administrative offices  and streamlining of our overhead structure to reduce operating expenses 
the restructuring charge excluded any integration costs relating to symbios 
as discussed in note of the notes  such costs relating to symbios were accrued as a liability assumed in the purchase in accordance with eitf no

the workforce reduction costs primarily included severance costs related to involuntary reduction of approximately jobs from manufacturing in japan  and engineering  sales  marketing and finance personnel located primarily in the us  japan and europe 
the fair value of assets determined to be impaired in accordance with the guidance on assets to be held and used in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  were the result of independent appraisals and management estimates 
severance costs and other exit costs noted above were determined in accordance with eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
as of december   the remaining cash requirements were related primarily to severance payouts 
the severance distributions were to be made out of our cash balance on hand at the time of the distributions 
as a result of the execution of the restructuring plan announced in the third quarter of  we reduced employee expenses by approximately million in and million in the fourth quarter of depreciation expense was reduced by approximately million in and million in the fourth quarter of we also realized additional savings of million in related to reduced lease and maintenance contract expenses primarily associated with the reduction in the number of engineering design centers  sales facilities and administrative offices worldwide 
the ongoing savings from the restructuring plan associated with the acquisition of seeq are not considered to be significant 
the restructuring actions  as outlined by the plan  were completed in the third quarter of  one year from the date the reserve was taken

see note of the notes 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in from million in the increase was due to additional amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of symbios in august and zsp in april amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation 
amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation of million in is due to non cash deferred stock compensation of million recorded in connection with the acquisitions of datapath systems  inc and syntax systems  inc  which closed on july  and november   respectively see note of the notes 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased debt outstanding due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes  offset in part by lower interest rates see note of the notes 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to interest expense on the bank debt facilities  which we entered into in august to fund the purchase of symbios  and the convertible notes issued in march the convertible notes 
see note of the notes 
beginning in january  we no longer capitalize interest associated with the construction of our fabrication facility in gresham  oregon  as operations of the facility commenced in december interest income and other 
interest income and other increased to million in income in from million in income in the increase was primarily attributable to the following events in  which were absent in million pre tax gain on the sale of a us facility in fremont  california  and million of additional interest income due to higher average balances of interest generating cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and higher interest rates 
the above noted increase was offset in part by net losses on disposals of fixed assets  bank fees and other miscellaneous expenses during interest income and other increased to million in income in from million in expense in the increase in was primarily attributable to the absence of the following events in that occurred in a million write down of our equity investment in two non public technology companies with impairment indicators not considered to be temporary in see note of the notes  a million write down of fixed assets and capitalized software in million in foreign exchange losses  which included a loss from the decision to close interest rate swap contracts  which converted the interest associated with the yen borrowings by lsi logic japan semiconductor inc jsi  our wholly owned subsidiary  from adjustable to fixed rates in see note to the notes  and a million litigation settlement from the former seeq in the third quarter of the increase was offset in part by a reduction in interest income attributable to the lower average balance of interest generating cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and lower interest rates during as compared to and other miscellaneous items 
the lower average balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted primarily from cash outlays associated with the purchase of symbios in the third quarter of and debt repayments  net of borrowings  primarily during the first quarter of gain on sale of equity securities 
during  we sold certain marketable equity securities for million in the open market  realizing a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in  we also recognized a million pre tax gain associated with equity securities of a certain technology company that was acquired by another technology company 
in  we recognized a gain of million on proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities 
in  we recognized a gain of million on proceeds of million from the sale of a long term investment in a non public technology company 
provision for income taxes 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes with an effective tax rate of 
the tax rate in was affected by non deductible transaction costs related to recent acquisitions and the sale of certain equity investments that were subject only to the us federal and state statutory tax rates 
excluding these transactions  the effective tax rate would have been 
the rates in and were and  respectively 
the tax rate in the years presented was lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries taxed at lower rates and the utilization of prior loss carryovers and other credits 
minority interest in net income of subsidiaries 
minority interest in net income of subsidiaries was million in  million in and million in the change in minority interest was attributable to the composition of earnings and losses among certain of our international affiliates for each of the respective years 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee acsec released statement of position sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the sop became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and required companies to expense all costs incurred or unamortized in connection with start up activities 
accordingly  we expensed the unamortized preproduction balance of million associated with the gresham manufacturing facility  net of tax  on january  and have presented it as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with sop no 
factors that may affect future operating results we believe that our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors detailed in risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k for the year ended december   which are incorporated by reference into management s discussion and analysis 
these factors include  among others cyclical nature of both the semiconductor and san systems industries and the markets addressed by our products  availability and extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  price erosion  competitive factors  timing of new product introductions  changes in product mix  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  product obsolescence  business and product market cycles  economic and technological risks associated with our acquisition and alliance activities  and the ability to develop and implement new technologies 
our operating results could also be impacted by sudden fluctuations in customer requirements  currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business 
we operate in a technologically advanced  rapidly changing and highly competitive environment 
we predominantly sell custom products to customers operating in a similar environment 
accordingly  changes in the conditions of any of our customers may have a greater impact on our operating results and financial condition than if we predominantly offered standard products that could be sold to many purchasers 
while we cannot predict what effect these various factors may have on our financial results  the aggregate effect of these and other factors could result in significant volatility in our future performance 
to the extent our performance may not meet expectations published by external sources  public reaction could result in a sudden and significantly adverse impact on the market price of our securities  particularly on a short term basis 
we have international subsidiaries and distributors that operate and sell our products globally 
further  we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and manufacturing equipment from foreign suppliers and incur labor and other operating costs in foreign currencies  particularly in our japanese manufacturing facilities 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 
we utilize forward exchange and purchased currency option contracts to manage our exposure associated with net asset and liability positions and cash flows denominated in non functional currencies 
see note of the notes 
there is no assurance that these hedging transactions will eliminate exposure to currency rate fluctuations that could affect our operating results 
our corporate headquarters and some of our manufacturing facilities are located near major earthquake faults 
as a result  in the event of a major earthquake  we could suffer damages which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
financial condition and liquidity cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to billion in from million in the increase was primarily a result of proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes  net of repayment of the existing debt  and proceeds from our employee stock option and purchase plans  partially offset by capital expenditures and cash paid for the purchase of common stock under our repurchase program and the acquisition of non public technology companies 
see note of the notes

in the third quarter of  we adopted a program of regular selling of marketable equity securities 
at december   short term investments included million of marketable equity securities that were sold during see note of the notes 
working capital 
working capital increased to billion in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the following factors higher short term investments resulting from purchases of debt and equity securities  net of sales and maturities and marketable equity securities reclassified from long term assets 
see notes and of the notes  higher net accounts receivable due to increased revenue and the timing of shipments when comparing the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of shipments during the fourth quarter of were more linear throughout the quarter whereas during the fourth quarter of  shipments increased towards the end of the quarter  lower current portion of long term obligations resulting from repayment of the revolver 
see note of the notes  and higher inventory reflecting the combination of higher sales in as compared to and lower than expected sales during the fourth quarter of the increase in working capital was offset in part by higher accrued salaries  wages and benefits and other liabilities primarily due to increases in headcount mainly resulting from acquisitions of companies see note of the notes as of december  as compared to december   higher income taxes payable due to the higher income tax rate applied in primarily due to the datapath acquisition  and also by higher trade accounts payable compared to working capital increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the following factors higher short term investments attributable to purchases of debt and equity securities  net of sales and maturities  with excess cash generated from operations  lower current liabilities primarily resulting from the repayment of the million short term debt facility see note of the notes  offset in part by reclassification of the current portion of long term obligations due in  and higher inventories reflecting the expectation of continued higher sales in as compared to the beginning of the increase in working capital was offset in part by higher accrued salaries  wages and benefits as of december  as compared to december  the increase in accrued salaries  wages and benefits was partially due to increases in compensation levels and compensation related programs in as compared to cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities 
during  we generated million of cash and cash equivalents from operating activities compared to million in the increase in net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities was primarily attributable the following factors higher net income before depreciation and amortization  write off of acquired in process research and development  non cash restructuring charges  amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation and gains on stock investments  and an increase in trade accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities 
the increase in trade accounts payable reflects higher purchases during the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of and the timing of invoice receipt and payment 
the increase in accrued and other liabilities was primarily attributable to higher income taxes payable due to a higher provision for income taxes for  net of payment and higher deferred tax liabilities recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of datapath 
the increase in cash from operations was offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily a result of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of and the timing of payment receipt 
higher inventory reflects the combination of higher sales in as compared to and lower than expected sales during the fourth quarter of the increase in prepaid and other assets was primarily a result of higher deferred tax assets recorded as of december  as compared to the balance as of december  and increased capitalized software and intellectual property during as compared to during  we generated million of cash and cash equivalents from operating activities compared to million in the increase in cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities was primarily attributable to the following factors higher net income before depreciation and amortization  write off of unamortized preproduction costs  acquired in process research and development  non cash restructuring charges and gains and losses on stock investments  and an increase in accrued and other liabilities 
the increase in accrued liabilities was partly due to higher bonus accruals as of december  as compared to december  as a result of higher operating income in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the bonus plan 
the increased cash from operations was offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily a result of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of and the timing of payment receipt 
inventories were higher as revenues are expected to continue to be higher in as compared to the beginning of cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the primary investing activities during included the following higher purchases of debt and equity securities available for sale and others  net of maturities and sales  higher purchases of property and equipment  and acquisitions of non public technology companies see note of the notes 
we believe that maintaining technological leadership in the highly competitive worldwide semiconductor industry requires substantial ongoing investment in advanced manufacturing capacity 
net capital additions were million in and million in in order to maintain our position as a technological market leader  we expect the level of capital expenditures to be approximately million in cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the primary investing activities during included the following purchases and sales of debt and equity securities available for sale and others  purchases of property and equipment  and the acquisition of zsp  a non public technology company 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in as compared to was primarily attributable to the acquisition of symbios in see note of the notes and more purchases of property and equipment in for our facility in gresham  oregon  which commenced operations in december the decrease was offset in part by higher purchases in of debt and equity securities available for sale  net of maturities and sale of debt and equity securities available for sale 
cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities 
cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities during totaled million compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from the convertible notes  net of repayment of the revolver see note of the notes and higher proceeds from our employee stock option and purchase plans in the increase was offset in part by debt issuance costs associated with the convertible notes and cash paid for the repurchase of our common stock under the repurchase program in cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities during totaled million compared to million in the decrease in was primarily attributable to proceeds from a credit agreement entered into in august to finance the acquisition of symbios and partial repayment in see note of the notes
