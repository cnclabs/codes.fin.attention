item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations selected financial data for this discussion of the results of operations follows  in thousands 
years ended december  revenues gathering marketing    pipeline    gross margin gathering marketing    pipeline    general and administrative expenses    depreciation and amortization    nonrecurring charges  operating income   interest income expense  net  net gain on disposal of surplus assets  the profitability of genesis depends to a significant extent upon its ability to maximize gross margin 
gross margins from gathering and marketing operations are a function of volumes purchased and the difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  minus the associated costs of aggregation and transportation 
the absolute price levels for crude oil do not necessarily bear a relationship to gross margin as absolute price levels normally impact revenues and cost of sales by equivalent amounts 
because period to period variations in revenues and cost of sales are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in gross margin for gathering and marketing operations  such changes are not addressed in the following discussion 
in our gathering and marketing business  we seek to purchase and sell crude oil at points along the distribution chain where we can achieve positive gross margins 
we generally purchase crude oil at prevailing prices from producers at the wellhead under short term contracts 
we then transport the crude along the distribution chain for sale to or exchange with customers 
in addition to purchasing crude at the wellhead  genesis purchases crude oil in bulk at major pipeline terminal points and enters into exchange transactions with third parties 
we generally enter into exchange transactions only when the cost of the exchange is less than the alternate cost we would incur in transporting or storing the crude oil 
in addition  we often exchange one grade of crude oil for another to maximize our margins or meet our contract delivery requirements 
these bulk and exchange transactions are characterized by large volumes and narrow profit margins on purchases and sales 
generally  as we purchase crude oil  we simultaneously establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation with respect to futures contracts on the nymex 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
it is our policy not to hold crude oil  futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes 
pipeline revenues and gross margins are primarily a function of the level of throughput and storage activity and are generated by the difference between the regulated published tariff and the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
changes in revenues  volumes and pipeline operating costs  therefore  are relevant to the analysis of financial results of genesis pipeline operations and are addressed in the following discussion of pipeline operations of genesis 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  during  the partnership recognized an unrealized loss on written option contracts of million 
this loss  when combined with several other factors  netted the decrease of million 
the other factors affecting gross margin were an increase of percent in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in an increase in gross margin of million  a percent decline in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  which reduced gross margin by million  an increase of million in credit costs due to the increase in purchase volumes and a percent increase in the average absolute price level of crude oil  and an increase of million in field operating costs  primarily from a million increase in payroll and benefits costs  million increase in fuel costs  and million increase in rental costs due to the replacement of the tractor trailer fleet with a leased fleet in the fourth quarter of the increased payroll related costs and fuel costs can be attributed to an approximate increase in the number of barrels transported by the partnership in trucks 
pipeline gross margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  pipeline revenues declined million as a result of declines in throughput and average tariffs 
throughput declined percent between the two years  resulting in a revenue decrease of million 
the average tariff collected on shipments was down  resulting in a revenue decrease of million 
revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels increased million as a result of an increase in the amount of pipeline loss allowance that the partnership is allowed to collect under the terms of its tariffs and higher crude prices 
pipeline operating costs were million higher in the period primarily due to million of increased expenditures in areas of spill prevention and employee benefits 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in from the level 
in  the partnership incurred million of costs related to year remediation 
no such costs were incurred in additionally  in  the partnership s costs for professional services and contract labor declined million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in from the level 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a portion of the partnership s assets becoming fully depreciated in  as well as asset sales in the latter part of non recurring charge 
in  the partnership  after approval by the common unitholders  was restructured as discussed below in partnership restructuring 
the costs associated with this restructuring were charged to expense 
these costs  totaling million  consisted primarily of legal and accounting fees  financial advisor fees  proxy solicitation expenses and the costs to print and mail a proxy statement to common unitholders 
the payment of these restructuring costs did not affect available cash for distributions as cash provided by salomon under the distribution support agreement was used to fund these costs 
interest income expense  net 
in  the partnership had an increase in its net interest expense of million 
interest expense increased million and interest income increased million 
the increase in interest expense resulted from higher interest rates  offset by lower average debt outstanding 
the average interest rate increased  resulting in an increase of million of interest  while the average debt outstanding declined by million  resulting in a decrease in interest expense of million 
interest income increased primarily as a result of an increase in interest earned on margin deposits with nymex brokers due to higher average balances 
the higher balances were required due to increased volatility of crude oil prices in the futures market during net gain on disposal of surplus assets 
in  management of the general partner made the decision to lease its tractor trailer fleet from ryder transportation services 
the existing fleet was sold  resulting in cash proceeds of million and a net gain of million 
the partnership sold additional surplus assets  which resulted in proceeds of million and a gain of million 
in  the partnership sold surplus trailers  receiving cash proceeds of million that resulted in a gain of million 
as a result of the change to a lease of the fleet in the fourth quarter of  the partnership expects field operating costs to increase in for rental charges 
this increase should be partially offset by a reduction in repairs and greater fuel efficiency 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in gross margin is primarily attributed to lower volumes purchased at the wellhead and in bulk at major trade locations 
in  the partnership s average wellhead volumes declined approximately  barrels per day 
wellhead purchases fell from an average of  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the decline in wellhead volumes began during the second half of in response to weakening crude oil prices 
volumes declined from  barrels per day during the first half of the year to  barrels per day during the second half of the year 
a large contract with pioneer natural resources expired at the end of  reducing volumes at the beginning of by an additional  barrels per day 
the loss of the pioneer volumes and continued declines associated with low crude oil prices cut wellhead volume during the first half of to an average of  barrels per day 
the partnership increased wellhead volumes during the second half of primarily by obtaining existing production by paying higher prices for the production than the previous purchaser 
increased volumes obtained through competition based on price for existing production generally result in incrementally lower margins per barrel 
wellhead purchases increased to  barrels per day during the third quarter and to  barrels per day for the fourth quarter 
the partnership s lease business feeds into its marketing and exchange activities 
the decline in wellhead volumes  as well as significant changes in price relationships for various grades  locations and timing of delivery of crude oil  resulted in lower bulk and exchange volumes in bulk and exchange volumes declined  barrels per day  dropping from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in gathering and marketing gross margins in were positively impacted by a widening spread between the price of crude oil paid at the wellhead and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  as crude oil inventories declined and refinery demand for prompt supply improved 
the partnership also implemented changes in its operations in response to declining wellhead volumes 
the changes implemented were a review of tractor and trailer utilization and realignment of the locations of equipment  allowing genesis to sell excess equipment and reduce personnel and operating costs related to the vehicles 
field operating costs decreased in total by million  with the reductions in the number of drivers and supervisory personnel decreasing payroll and benefits by million 
disposals of excess tractors and trailers reduced fuel and repair costs by million 
pipeline gross margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  although average daily volumes increased  the average length of the pipeline movement was shorter  resulting in less tariff income 
pipeline operating costs increased due to increased expenditures for corrosion control of approximately million and the costs associated with the spill the partnership had from its mississippi system in december of approximately million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million in over the level 
this increase can be attributed to expenditures related to addressing the year issue in  totaling million that were charged to general and administrative expenses 
this increase in costs for the year issue was partially offset by decreases of less than million each in travel and entertainment expenses and expense related to the restricted unit plan due to employee resignations 
depreciation and amortization 
in april  the partnership acquired the gathering and marketing assets of falco s d  inc falco 
twelve months of depreciation and amortization on these assets is included in  while only included depreciation and amortization from the date of acquisition 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization to million for the year ended december   resulted primarily from this asset acquisition 
nonrecurring charge 
in  the partnership recorded a nonrecurring charge of million as a result of the shut in of its main pass pipeline located offshore 
the charge consisted of million of cash related to the shut in and a million write down of the asset 
interest income expense  net 
in  the partnership had net interest income of million 
in  the partnership had net interest expense of million 
this difference of million is attributable to increased borrowings by the partnership in to acquire the falco assets and to acquire a pipeline near west columbia  texas 
as these acquisitions occurred  the partnership had less available funds and increased its borrowings under its loan agreement 
the borrowings were outstanding throughout additionally  market interest rates  as evidenced by the prime rate  rose during by also increasing the partnership s interest costs 
net gain on disposal of surplus assets 
in  the partnership recognized a gain of million as a result of the sale of excess tractors and trailers 
hedging activities genesis routinely utilizes forward contracts  swaps  options and futures contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of market fluctuations on inventories and contractual commitments 
gains and losses on forward contracts  swaps and futures contracts used to hedge future contract purchases of unpriced crude oil  where firm commitments to sell are required prior to establishment of the purchase price  are deferred until the margin from the underlying risk element of the hedged item is recognized 
the partnership recognized a net loss of million for the year ended december  the partnership recognized net gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to its hedging activity 
partnership restructuring on october   a proxy statement was mailed to common unitholders of record on october  this proxy statement requested that the common unitholders vote on a proposed restructuring of the partnership at a meeting of unitholders held on december  on december   the unitholders of genesis approved a restructuring of the partnership 
as a result of this approval  the gcolp partnership agreement was amended to reduce the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from the previous to the new per unit  reduce correspondingly the respective per unit dollar distribution thresholds that must be achieved before the general partner is entitled to incentive compensation payments from the prior threshold levels of  and per unit to the new levels of  and per unit  eliminate all of the subordinated olp units in gcolp  and as a result  provide that the common units will no longer accrue arrearages if the minimum quarterly distribution is not paid in full in any quarter  and eliminate  without payment of any consideration  all of the outstanding additional partnership interests  or apis  issued to salomon in exchange for its distribution support and  as a result  eliminate the partnership s obligation to redeem the apis issued to salomon 
additionally  as a result of the approval of the restructuring salomon contributed to gcolp in cash the remaining distribution support of million 
after payment of million of transaction costs associated with the restructuring  a special distribution of the remaining cash of million  or per common unit  was paid on december   to common unitholders of record on december   and salomon extended the expiration date of its million credit support obligation to gcolp from march   to december   under its current terms and conditions 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow in was due primarily to the reduction in the partnership s gross margin of million offset by the cash premiums collected on the sale of written call options related to this cash  totaling million  increased accrued liabilities at december   and will be recognized into income as the option periods expire 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  in  the partnership received cash totaling million from the sale of its tractor trailer fleet and other surplus assets 
the partnership expended million on property additions  primarily in its pipeline operations 
in  the partnership expended million on property additions and received million from the sale of excess trucking equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the partnership paid regular quarterly distributions to common unitholders and the general partner totaling million and a special distribution to common unitholders in december totaling million 
the special distribution was paid pursuant to the restructuring discussed above 
the partnership received million of distribution support from salomon in of which million was used to pay restructuring costs 
in  the partnership paid distributions to the common unitholders and the general partner totaling million 
in  the partnership received million of distribution support from salomon 
the partnership also paid million in and to acquire common units in the open market for treasury  some of which were subsequently reissued under the restricted unit plan 
cash flows from financing activities were provided by borrowings in the amount of million and million under the loan agreement in and  respectively 
capital expenditures in  the partnership expended million for maintenance capital expenditures 
the majority of these maintenance capital expenditures related to pipeline operations 
in  the partnership expended million for capital expenditures  with million of that amount for maintenance capital expenditures 
business expansion project expenditures totaled million for various small projects 
in  the partnership expended million for capital expenditures for projects related to the expansion of its business activities and million for maintenance capital expenditures 
the expansion projects included the acquisition of the gathering and marketing assets of falco  located primarily in louisiana and east texas and the acquisition of miles of pipeline in the west columbia area of texas 
this pipeline begins in jackson county  texas  and ends at genesis webster station in harris county 
the partnership has no material commitments for capital expenditures for  however  the partnership does plan to perform testing of the out of service segment of its mississippi system 
until testing is completed and approval is obtained from regulators  an estimate of the amount of expenditures needed to put the segment back in service cannot be made 
working capital and credit resources pursuant to the master credit support agreement  salomon is providing credit support in the form of a guaranty facility in connection with the purchase  sale or exchange of crude oil in the ordinary course of the partnership s business with third parties 
the aggregate amount of the guaranty facility will be limited to million for the year ending december  to be reduced in each case by the amount of any obligation to a third party to the extent that such party has a prior security interest in the collateral under the master credit support agreement 
the partnership is required to pay a guaranty fee to salomon 
in  the fee was for the first half of the year and for the remainder of the year 
for  the fee is 
the partnership will pay an additional fee of on any guaranty utilization in excess of the million commitment 
in may and june   the partnership exceeded the million commitment and  as a result  paid salomon million for the excess utilization 
guaranty fees  including excess utilization fees  paid for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   the aggregate amount of obligations covered by guarantees was million  including million in payable obligations and million in estimated crude oil purchase obligations for january salomon received a security interest in all the partnership s receivables  inventories  general intangibles and cash to secure obligations under the master credit support agreement 
salomon provided a working capital facility to the partnership until august at that time  the working capital facility was replaced with a revolving credit loan agreement with bank one  texas  na that agreement was replaced with a secured revolving credit facility credit agreement with bnp paribas in june the credit agreement provides for loans or letters of credit in the aggregate not to exceed the lesser of million or the borrowing base as defined in the credit agreement 
if bnp paribas obtains loan commitments for an additional million  the amount available under the credit agreement would increase to million 
as of december   bnp paribas had not obtained loan commitments for the additional million 
during  interest was calculated  at the partnership s option  by using either libor plus or bnp paribas prime rate minus 
in  the credit agreement was amended to change the interest rates to libor plus or bnp paribas prime rate minus 
the credit agreement expires on the earlier of a february  or b days prior to the termination of the master credit support agreement with salomon 
as the master credit support agreement terminates on december  the credit agreement with bnp paribas is currently scheduled to expire on november  the credit agreement is collateralized by the accounts receivable  inventory  cash accounts and margin accounts of gcolp  subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement between bnp paribas and salomon 
there is no compensating balance requirement under the credit agreement 
a commitment fee of on the available portion of the commitment is provided for in the agreement 
material covenants and restrictions include the following a maintain a current ratio calculated after the exclusion of debt under the credit agreement from current liabilities of to  b maintain a tangible capital base as defined in the credit agreement in gcolp of not less than million  and c maintain a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of not more than to in  the agreement was amended to change the maximum leverage ratio requirement to not more than to additionally  the credit agreement imposes restrictions on the ability of gcolp to sell its assets  incur other indebtedness  create liens and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
the partnership was not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio covenant at the end of each month from june  through november  a waiver for each period has been obtained from bnp paribas 
the partnership was in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio and all other ratios of the credit agreement at december  at december   the partnership had million of loans outstanding under the credit agreement 
the partnership had no letters of credit outstanding at december  at december   million was available to be borrowed under the credit agreement 
the current average interest rate is 
there can be no assurance of the availability or the terms of credit for the partnership 
at this time  salomon does not intend to provide guarantees or other credit support after the credit support period expires in december in addition  if the general partner is removed without its consent  salomon s credit support obligations will terminate 
further  salomon s obligations under the master credit support agreement may be transferred or terminated early subject to certain conditions 
management of the partnership intends to replace the guaranty facility and the credit agreement with a working capital letter of credit facility with one or more lenders prior to november  the general partner expects that a replacement facility will cost more than its current guaranty facility 
the general partner may be required to reduce or restrict the partnership s gathering and marketing activities because of limitations on its ability to obtain credit support and financing for its working capital needs 
any significant decrease in the partnership s financial strength  regardless of the reason for such decrease  may increase the number of transactions requiring letters of credit or other financial support  make it more difficult for the partnership to obtain such letters of credit  and or may increase the cost of obtaining them 
this situation could in turn adversely affect the partnership s ability to maintain or increase the level of its purchasing and marketing activities or otherwise adversely affect the partnership s profitability and available cash 
at december   the partnership s consolidated balance sheet reflected a working capital deficit of million 
this working capital deficit combined with the short term nature of both the guaranty facility with salomon and the credit agreement with bnp paribas could have a negative impact on the partnership 
some counterparties use the balance sheet and the nature of available credit support as a basis for determining the level of credit support demanded from the partnership as a condition of doing business 
increased demands for credit support beyond the maximum credit limitations and higher credit costs may adversely affect the partnership s ability to maintain or increase the level of its purchasing and marketing activities or otherwise adversely affect the partnership s profitability and available cash for distributions 
distributions generally  gcolp will distribute of its available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner 
available cash consists generally of all of the cash receipts less cash disbursements of gcolp adjusted for net changes to reserves 
a full definition of available cash is set forth in the partnership agreement 
as a result of the restructuring approved by unitholders on december   the minimum quarterly distribution mqd for each quarter has been reduced to per unit beginning with the distribution for the fourth quarter of  which was paid in february in  the partnership paid regular distributions to the common unitholders and the general partner totaling per unit and a special distribution of per unit to the common unitholders as a result of the approval of the partnership restructuring 
in and  the partnership paid total distributions of per unit to the common unitholders and the general partner 
a distribution of per unit  applicable to the fourth quarter of  was paid on february  to holders of record on january the distributions in were paid utilizing distribution support from salomon of million 
in  distribution support of million was utilized 
the obligation of salomon to provide distribution support provided for a total of million 
with the utilization of million of distribution support to pay the restructuring costs  all distribution support had been utilized at december  crude oil spill on december   the partnership had a spill of crude oil from its mississippi system 
approximately  barrels of oil spilled from the pipeline near summerland  mississippi  and entered a creek nearby 
a portion of the oil then flowed into the leaf river 
the partnership responded to this incident immediately  deploying crews to evaluate  clean up and monitor the spilled oil 
the spill was cleaned up  with ongoing monitoring and reduced clean up activity expected to continue for an undetermined period of time 
the oil spill is covered by insurance and the financial impact to the partnership for the cost of the clean up has not been material 
the estimated cost of the spill clean up is expected to be million 
this amount includes actual clean up costs and estimates for ongoing maintenance and settlement of potential liabilities to landowners in connection with the spill 
the incident was reported to insurers 
at december   million had been paid to vendors and claimants for spill costs  and million was included in accrued liabilities for estimated future expenditures 
current assets included million of expenditures submitted and approved by insurers but not yet reimbursed  million for expenditures not yet submitted to insurers and million for expenditures not yet incurred or billed to the partnership 
at december   million in reimbursements had been received from insurers 
as a result of this crude oil spill  certain federal and state regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties that would not be covered by insurance 
at this time  it is not possible to predict whether the partnership will be fined  the amount of such fines or whether such governmental agencies will prevail in imposing such fines 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statement 
the segment of the mississippi system where the spill occurred has been shut down and will not be restarted until regulators give their approval 
the partnership plans in to perform testing of the affected segment of the pipeline at an estimated cost of million to determine a course of action to restart the system 
regulatory authorities may require specific testing or changes to the pipeline before allowing the partnership to restart the system 
at this time  it is unknown whether there will be any required testing or changes and the related cost of that testing or changes 
subject to the results of testing and regulatory approval  the partnership intends to restart this segment of the mississippi system during the latter half of if management of the partnership determines that the costs of additional testing or changes are too high  that segment of the system may not be restarted 
if this part of the mississippi system is taken out of service  annual tariff revenues would be reduced by approximately million from the level and the net book value of that portion of the pipeline would be written down to its net realizable value  resulting in a non cash write off of approximately million 
the partnership was named as one of the defendants in a complaint filed by garner environmental services  inc garner on october  in the th district court of harris county  cause no 
garner  who participated in the pipeline oil spill clean up  had sued the partnership on account and breach of contract 
in march this lawsuit was settled for a minimal amount 
crude oil contamination in the first quarter of  the partnership purchased crude oil from a third party that was subsequently determined to contain organic chlorides 
these barrels were delivered into the partnership s texas pipeline system and potentially contaminated  barrels of oil held in storage and  barrels of oil in the pipeline 
the partnership has disposed of all contaminated crude 
the partnership incurred costs associated with transportation  testing and consulting in the amount of  as of december  the partnership has recorded a receivable for  to reflect the expected recovery of the accrued costs from the third party 
the third party has provided the partnership with evidence that it has sufficient resources to cover the total expected damages incurred by the partnership 
management of the partnership believes that it will recover any damages incurred from the third party 
the partnership has been named one of the defendants in a complaint filed by thomas richard brown on january   in the th district court of harris county  cause no 
mr 
brown  an employee of pennzoil quaker state company pqs  seeks damages for burns and other injuries suffered as a result of a fire and explosion that occurred at the pennzoil quaker state refinery in shreveport  louisiana  on january  on january   pqs filed a plea in intervention in the cause filed by mr 
brown 
pqs seeks property damages  loss of use and business interruption 
both plaintiffs claim the fire and explosion was caused  in part  by genesis selling to pqs crude oil that was contaminated with organic chlorides 
management of the partnership believes that the suit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter 
management of the partnership believes that any potential liability will be covered by insurance 
change to american stock exchange until february   the common units of genesis were traded on the new york stock exchange nyse 
in december  the partnership was notified that it failed to meet the nyse s continued listing requirements and that the nyse was commencing delisting procedures 
management of the general partner submitted a plan to the nyse to cure the continued listing deficiencies 
however  management later concluded that it would be preferable to list the partnership s common units on the amex 
on january   the partnership s common units ceased to be listed on the nyse and  on february   began being listed on the amex 
current business conditions changes in the price of crude oil impact gathering and marketing and pipeline gross margins to the extent that oil producers adjust production levels 
short term and long term price trends impact the amount of cash flow that producers have available to maintain existing production and to invest in new reserves  which in turn impacts the amount of crude oil that is available to be gathered and marketed by the partnership and its competitors 
although crude oil prices have increased from per barrel in january to more than per barrel in the fourth quarter of  us onshore crude oil production volumes have not improved 
further  producers appear to be responding cautiously to the oil price increase and are focusing more on drilling for natural gas 
this change is clearly demonstrated by the baker hughes north american rotary rig count for to baker hughes north american rotary rig count average number of rigs drilling for crude oil year oil gas price per bbl annual average price for through for west texas intermediate at cushing  oklahoma based on the limited improvement in the number of rigs drilling for oil  management of the general partner believes that oil production in its primary areas of operation is likely to continue to decrease 
although there has been some increase since in the number of drilling and workover rigs being utilized in the partnership s primary areas of operation  management of the general partner believes that this activity is more likely to have the effect of reducing the rate of decline rather than meaningfully increasing wellhead volumes in its operating areas in and the partnership s improved volumes in compared to were primarily due to obtaining existing production by paying higher prices for the production than the previous purchaser 
increased volumes obtained through competition based on price for existing production generally result in incrementally lower margins per barrel 
as crude oil prices rise  the partnership s utilization of  and cost of credit under  the guaranty facility increases with respect to the same volume of business 
the general partner has taken steps to reduce or restrict the partnership s gathering and marketing activities due to the million limit of the guaranty facility 
additionally  as prices rise  the partnership may have to increase the amount of its credit agreement in order to have funds available to meet margin calls on the nymex and to fund inventory purchases 
no assurances can be made that the partnership would be able to increase the size of its credit agreement or that changes to the terms of such increased credit agreement would not have a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows of the partnership 
adoption of fas for in january  the partnership adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established new accounting and reporting guidelines for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement 
companies must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
under sfas no 
 the partnership will mark to market all of its derivative instruments at each period end with changes in fair value being recorded as unrealized gains or losses 
such unrealized gains or losses will change  based on prevailing market prices  at each balance sheet date prior to the period in which the transaction actually occurs 
in general  sfas no 
requires that at the date of initial adoption  the difference between the fair value of derivative instruments and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be recorded in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the adoption of sfas no 
will result in a charge of approximately million to net income  which will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership s primary price risk relates to the effect of crude oil price fluctuations on its inventories and the fluctuations each month in grade and location differentials and their effects on future contractual commitments 
the partnership utilizes nymex commodity based futures contracts  forward contracts  swap agreements and option contracts to hedge its exposure to these market price fluctuations 
management believes the hedging program has been effective in minimizing overall price risk 
at december   the partnership used futures  forward and options contracts exclusively in its hedging program with the latest contract being settled in july information about these contracts is contained in the table set forth below 
sell short buy long contracts contracts crude oil inventory volume  bbls carrying value fair value commodity futures contracts contract volumes  bbls   weighted average price per bbl contract value in thousands   fair value in thousands   commodity forward contracts contract volumes  bbls   weighted average price per bbl contract value in thousands   fair value in thousands   commodity option contracts contract volumes  bbls  weighted average strike price per bbl contract value in thousands  fair value in thousands  the table above presents notional amounts in barrels  the weighted average contract price  total contract amount in us dollars and total fair value amount in us dollars
