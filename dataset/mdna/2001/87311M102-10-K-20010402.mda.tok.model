item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
capital resources and liquidity calendar year ended december  during the year ended december   beginning cash reserves of  were increased by net cash provided from operating activities of  resulting in a total of  in internally generated working capital for use in funding the ongoing expansion  development and exploration of the company s oil and gas properties 
strengthening gas prices were reflected in ongoing positive cash flow from operations in the latter half of the year and contributed significantly to the company s ability to expand its planned activities 
in february   net of offering costs  was provided through a private placement of common stock with swisspartners investment network ag  a private investment firm based in zurich  switzerland 
proceeds from the placement were for general corporate purposes  but the timing of its receipt early in the year  allowed the company to complete the acquisition of significant additional acreage in its core maverick basin area 
the funding also provided additional flexibility to accelerate ongoing exploration activities 
an additional  was provided during the year from new equipment purchase financing  while  was provided from the exercise of outstanding warrants for the purchase of shares of the company s commons stock 
the company applied  of its working capital to fund the expansion and ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
included were drilling  completion and leasehold acquisition costs totaling  primarily targeting txco s core area  the maverick basin 
included in these costs were expenditures for the drilling  completion and re entry of gas and oil wells  new maverick basin mineral lease purchases of approximately  acres for the year 
also included was  applied in the expansion of the company s paloma lease gas gathering facilities  including the purchase of two new natural gas compressors at a total cost of  the company made timely payments of  on its long term debt obligations during  while payments on interest totaled  these payments led to the early retirement in may   of the then remaining  due under the original financing agreement with range energy finance corporation nyse rrc 
as a result of these activities  the company ended the year with a positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to this greatly improved year end position compares to positive working capital of  and a current ratio of at december  the dramatic increase in working capital is attributable to the growth in operating cash flow from ongoing operations  the company s ability to raise equity capital and the improvements in commodity prices throughout the year 
management is confident of the company s ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations and to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements for and beyond 
four month transition period ended december  the company changed its fiscal year from august to december  effective for the calendar year beginning january  the four month transition period from september through december  preceded the start of the new calendar year as presented above 
the following discussion relates only to this four month transition period 
cash reserves of  at august  were increased by cash provided from operating activities of  resulting in  in working capital available for use in meeting the company s ongoing operational and development needs during the four month transition period ended december  during this four month period  portions of this capital were used to fund payments on debt of  and interest of  the company applied  to the expansion and ongoing development of its core oil and gas properties 
these costs included drilling and completion costs for wells drilled or completed during the period and d seismic acquisition and reprocessing costs 
as a result of these activities  working capital improved from a negative  at august  to a positive  at december  the current ratio improved to a to compared to a current ratio of 
to at the beginning of the period 
the improvement in working capital and current ratio levels were primarily due to sustained gas and oil production levels and continued strength in these commodity prices 
fiscal year ended august  during the year ended august   beginning cash reserves of  were increased by net cash provided from operating activities of  resulting in a total of  in working capital available for use in funding the company s ongoing development and exploration of its oil and gas properties 
the ongoing positive cash flow from operations throughout the year significantly improved the company s ability to increase its core revenues from oil and gas operations  thereby enhancing its ability to overcome the impact of weak oil and gas prices through most of an additional  was obtained during the year  under the existing financing agreement with range energy finance corporation  bringing total borrowings from range to  the financing was specifically for ongoing development of the company s natural gas producing properties in maverick county  texas 
the company applied  of its working capital to fund the expansion and ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
included were drilling and completion costs of  for current year drilling of maverick basin gas and oil wells  plus costs associated with wells drilled during the last quarter of also included were  in d seismic acquisition and reprocessing costs and  in lease extension payments to maintain non producing lease acreage in the company s growing maverick basin lease block 
the company made timely payments on long term debt of  during  including  paid on the range financing agreement 
scheduled payments totaling  were made on the company s remaining long term notes during the remainder of the year 
during the rd quarter of  txco successfully entered into a joint venture agreement with castle exploration company  castle a wholly owned subsidiary of castle energy corporation nasdaq cecx  whereby castle agreed to fund up to  for of all costs to acquire approximately  acres of additional leases  fund a square mile d seismic survey and drill up to gas wells 
in exchange  txco contributed its interest in an  lease to the venture  was named operator and will be carried at no cost  for a interest in the first wells drilled 
additionally  txco will be licensed to share in all seismic data gathered and will earn a working interest in all leases acquired with the funds 
at year end  all d seismic acquisition and processing had been completed  and company geologists and geophysicists were in process of interpreting and evaluating the new data 
during the th quarter of  the company successfully closed another non cash transaction to acquire various oil and gas mineral interests near or adjoining txco s maverick basin leasehold 
in exchange for  shares of its restricted common stock valued at  the company purchased a interest in  acres known as the chittim lease  including a working interest in producing oil and gas wells and associated equipment 
in addition  txco also received a working interest in two separate leases totaling approximately  acres 
as a result of these activities  the company ended fiscal year with negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to this compares to positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to at august  working capital weakened during primarily due to cash outlays for its aggressive ongoing development activities and due to timely payments made under the terms of the range financing agreement 
although the company had a working capital deficit at year end  included in current liabilities is  estimated as the debt payment for fiscal under the range financing agreement 
the range debt payments are only due and payable out of each future month s net cash flow from the collateralized producing wells 
fiscal year ended august  during the year ended august   beginning cash reserves of  were reduced by net cash used in operating activities of  resulting in a total of  in working capital available for use in funding the company s ongoing development and exploration of its oil and gas properties  significantly improving the company s potential to increase its core revenues from oil and gas operations  and enhancing its ability to overcome the impact of continued weakness in oil and gas prices 
throughout fiscal  the company pursued opportunities to enhance its liquidity by the conversion of existing short term trade payables to long term debt and the conversion of debentures into common stock 
management successfully converted separate accounts totaling  in current trade payables into separate notes  with payment terms ranging from to months and interest accruing at rates ranging from to 
further improvements to the company s debt structure were realized by management s election to exercise the company s option to convert its outstanding  debentures to equity 
effective january   the company issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding debentures  including accrued interest of  at the conversion price of per share 
in addition to the extremely favorable conversion price for the new issuance  and the elimination of  in future annual interest expense  management s elimination of its primary long term debt significantly enhanced the company s ability to pursue additional sources of equity or debt based working capital 
late in the final quarter of  the company entered into a financing agreement with range energy finance corporation  a subsidiary of range resources corporation nyse rrc  formerly domain energy corporation to initially establish a borrowing ceiling of  during fiscal year the borrowing ceiling was increased to  the financing was specifically for ongoing development of the company s natural gas producing properties in maverick county  texas 
funds were advanced in exchange for a limited term overriding royalty interest tied to existing and future production from specified depths underlying certain of the company s oil and gas leases in maverick county 
terms provided for repayment of the funds  with interest at  from a specified portion of sales proceeds from all existing and future wells to be drilled on the paloma lease 
by august  the company had borrowed  under the agreement 
throughout the year ended august   the company applied  of its available working capital to fund the ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
this included drilling and completion costs of  associated with the current year drilling of four new maverick basin gas wells  three new williston basin oil wells and costs associated with wells drilled prior to the current fiscal year  plus  for completion of the newest segment of the company s new gas gathering system in maverick county during also included were d seismic acquisitions totaling  over company leases in north dakota and  on the paloma lease in south texas 
additional investments in non producing lease acreage totaled  for the year 
additionally  the company made payments on its long term debt during the year of  included in the total was  paid during the first quarter  in full prepayment of the company s outstanding line of credit with luzerner kantonalbank 
scheduled payments totaling  were made on the company s remaining long term notes during the remainder of as a result of these activities  the company ended fiscal year with positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to this compared to positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to at august  while the company s working capital position weakened from the previous year  the results of the company s dramatic drilling success ratio during for new glen rose wells became evident during the first quarter of fiscal year capital requirements the major components of the company s plans  and the requirements for additional capital for include the following maverick basin activity initial capital expenditures planned for total over  are presented net to the company s interest  and are primarily on its maverick basin core properties 
included is  for targeted lease acquisitions in maverick county during the first quarter of additional d seismic acquisition plans total  and consist primarily of a square mile program commenced in february on the western most portion of the comanche lease 
gas gathering infrastructure expansion plan expenditures total  for the  including  for the company s shallow cbm project in the comanche lease  plus  for pipeline additions its paloma lease pipeline system 
the largest component of planned capital expenditures total  for exploratory drilling wells and for an expanding number of re entry targets available to the company due to its october acquisition of shallow shut in well bores prospective for cbm coal bed methane on the comanche lease 
the company plans to drill or re enter a minimum of wells  including new glen rose reef prospects and cbm new or re entry prospects 
a total of  is reserved for glen rose reef prospects  while  is planned for cbm exploration 
three of the glen rose wells are planned on the comanche lease on a wi basis under the company s recently announced comanche lease operating agreement  with saxet energy as operator 
drilling is expected to occur late in  after d seismic processing is completed on the ongoing seismic data acquisition program currently underway on the comanche lease 
the remaining glen rose wells are targeted at reef prospects already defined by existing d seismic on the remaining portion of the company s maverick basin lease block 
a typical paloma lease glen rose reef well costs the company approximately  to  to complete or  as a dry hole  on a net basis 
comanche lease glen rose prospects net drilling costs are expected to average  more than paloma lease wells  as the glen rose interval trends deeper downdip when encountered under the comanche lease 
the company continues to benefit from its carried interest in the ongoing d seismic processing and interpretation activities continuing on its deep jurassic project under its paloma kincaid lease block  as all costs have been funded todate by its partner and operator  blue star oil and gas  ltd no substantial funding requirements are required of txco nor are any planned for for the project 
estimated expenditures required to maintain the company s interest in all of its remaining undeveloped south texas leasehold acreage for fiscal are approximately  exclusive of required drilling obligations 
williston basin activity the company plans to maintain its existing producing properties and the payment of delay rentals and lease extensions on selected undeveloped leases  with scheduled delay rentals of  and will continue in its efforts to offer remaining acreage  seismic data  and identified prospects to other industry operators 
summary of capital resources and liquidity while management is confident it has identified sufficient sources of working capital to carry out its current exploration and development plans on its texas leaseholds  as well as to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business through the end of the new year  there is no assurance that energy prices will continue to improve 
should prices weaken  the reduction in revenues could cause the company to re evaluate its expected sources of working capital and may cause the company to reduce its current operating plans 
management is actively involved in ongoing discussions with various industry partners and domestic and foreign based sources of debt and equity financing 
these parties could provide favorably structured drilling arrangements that  along with the company s internally generated cash flow would provide funding as required to increase the company s planned drilling activity during year management remains confident that financial resources will remain available  enabling the company to continue the rapid development of its gas and oil properties and continue to meet its normal operational and debt service obligations 
change in fiscal year a form k was filed on december   in order to report that the board of directors of the company had elected to change its annual reporting period from a fiscal year ending august to a calendar year ending december effective for the calendar year beginning january  the transition period for this change was reported on february   on the company s transition report on form q for the four month period ended december  results of operations compared to the company reported net income of  or per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year ended december   compared to a net income of  or per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year ended august  the increase included the result of recognition in the current year of a deferred tax asset of  the deferred tax asset reflects the cumulative future tax benefit of a portion of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax benefit was recognized by a reduction to the valuation allowance established in prior years against the company s deferred tax assets 
management believes it is now more likely than not that a significant portion of its deferred tax asset will be realized 
therefore  the valuation allowance was reduced and a deferred tax asset recognized for the amount expected to be realized through taxable earnings over the next three year period 
additionally  revenues increased over levels due primarily to the substantial increase in prices received during the year 
average realized prices for gas rose to per mcf  a increase  while average realized prices for oil rose to  a increase 
total net gas production for the year was  mcf  an increase of  mcf over this increase resulted from new gas wells being brought on line through the year  but was partially offset by the general production decline of the existing older gas wells 
total net oil production for the same periods decreased  bbls to  bbls in year this decline was primarily caused by the reduced production in the williston basin attributable to increased water production 
average daily net gas production in year increased to  mcf compared to fiscal  while average daily net oil production in year decreased to bbls  a decline compared to fiscal exploration expenses increased  compared to levels primarily due to the high dry hole expense resulting from accelerated exploration activities initiated during the current year 
current year charge offs included the costs of drilling wells to dry hole expense while the were no dry holes in the prior year 
pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing and non producing properties for impairment 
abandoned leases and equipment expense increased by primarily due to recognition of the expiration of  acres in the williston basin during year versus much fewer incidents of acreage costs being charged off during similarly  impairment expense increased by due to a  acres block of non producing acreage in the williston basin expected to expire in early depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by over levels due primarily to the higher depletion rate resulting from decreased reserves for specific producing properties 
the increase in depreciation was due to investment in equipment expanding the paloma lease gathering system completed at mid year 
general and administrative costs increased compared to levels reflecting the higher sustained level of company operations 
increased salaries and related costs due primarily to the addition of two employees and increased compensation levels over the comparable period in an increase in investor communications of  reflects the increased level of presentations and associated print and electronic material design and preparation costs incurred by the company in conjunction with domestic and international investor and industry conferences during the increase in interest income reflects the higher cash levels in interest bearing accounts during versus levels 
interest expense decreased by  in from due to the retirement of the range debt during the second quarter of the minority interest in income of subsidiaries is a new line item resulting from the consolidation of txco s majority owned subsidiaries 
there were no consolidated subsidiaries in the prior year 
compared to the company reported net income of  or per diluted share for the year ended august   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the same period in the attainment of profitability was primarily the result of a increase in revenues over levels due primarily to significant new production from new wells placed on line during the year  including gas wells completed late in the last quarter of the prior year 
while very positive  the increases were significantly offset by the weakness in oil and gas prices through the first half of gas sales volume increases also reflect the impact of the first full year of operation of the expanded gas gathering system completed during the latter part of exploration expenses decreased by compared to levels due to the high drilling success in the maverick basin compared to multiple williston basin dry holes drilled or abandoned during the prior year 
abandoned leases and equipment expense decreased by primarily to the non recurring nature of the one time charge off of uneconomical producing properties during due to the oil and gas price collapse during impairment expense decreased by also due to the non recurring nature of the initially large impairment provisions required due to the oil price collapse in the prior year  while lower impairment provisions proved adequate in light of the improvement in realized oil and gas prices during the last half of the current year 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by over levels due primarily to an increase in depletion 
the change in depletion was due to the adverse impact on year end reserve estimates caused by declining oil production and increasing water disposal costs associated with williston basin production 
the decrease in loan fee amortization expense as compared to  reflects the non recurring nature of the prior period s recognition of  in previously capitalized prepaid loan fees due to the conversion of a  debenture in january fiscal loan fee amortization expense has been reclassified for comparative purposes with current year expense 
interest expense increased by over  reflecting a full year of interest charges on borrowings under the range financing agreement entered into during the last quarter of the prior year 
compared to revenues from oil and gas sales increased over as a result of significant new production from the successful completion of the nine new wells during the last part of the  plus the additional production from new gas wells added during lease operating expenses  related directly to the costs of operating the newly producing williston basin oil wells with very high production associated water disposal costs  increased by over the disproportionately higher increase in lease operating expense increases reflects the difference in the company s normal natural gas production expense level versus the significantly higher per unit production cost associated with its williston basin oil production 
exploration expenses  including the costs of unsuccessful wells increased by due to the write off of two high working interest dry holes during the year compared to two very low working interest dry holes in the previous year 
the fall of oil prices at mid year rendered the completion of the wells uneconomical 
abandoned leases and equipment increased to  reflecting the ongoing impact of the fall of oil prices during the year that rendered marginal properties uneconomic to maintain or renew 
included in the non cash charge off for the current year are  in williston basin leases   in zavala county leases south texas  and  in canadian crown leases  all determined to be uneconomic and expiring during the current year due to the continued impact of low oil and gas prices 
also included in the non cash writeoff was the remaining capitalized costs  for the kincaid  a horizontal georgetown test well drilled in maverick county during the third quarter of that failed to produce economic quantities of gas 
pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing properties and non producing mineral leases for impairment 
based on the fall in oil prices during the year and the resulting impact on the updated reserve estimates at year end  the company identified certain producing properties which required impairment 
additionally  non producing leaseholds were reviewed for potential impairment 
certain leases  with expiration dates through december  were identified which would not be renewed 
non cash impairment charges totaling  were recorded at year end including  of williston basin and texas non producing leases set to expire through calendar year additionally  a  impairment was recorded reflecting the excess of unamortized book value over the future realizable reserves primarily related to certain of its williston basin wells 
additional expenses during the year include depreciation  depletion and amortization of  plus current year exploration expenses of  except for the statutory  intangible non cash expenses required for compliance reporting purposes described above and current year exploration expenses  actual operating activities for the year ended august  resulted in positive cash flow from producing operations of  this level of positive cash flow  if sustained  is sufficient to provide for funding of the company s primary administrative operations 
management feels confident this source of internally generated working capital will continue to grow as the company s texas gas production levels expand through fiscal and beyond 
general and administrative costs increased to  from  increases in salaries totaling approximately  were due primarily to a full twelve months of wages in for the increased number of new employee positions required by the company s expansion in operations as a result of the williston basin lease acquisition versus only a partial year for the previous year 
the  decrease in interest income in reflects the lower cash levels in interest bearing accounts during versus the prior year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
the company s major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
prices have fluctuated significantly over the last four years and such volatility is expected to continue  and the range of such price movement is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on the company s annual revenues and operating income 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is minimal as all of its debt at december  is at fixed rates 
financial instruments the company s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
its cash equivalents are cash investment funds which are placed with a major financial institution 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable result from oil and gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the oil and natural gas industry 
this concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact the company s overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
historically  the company has not experienced any significant credit losses on such receivables
