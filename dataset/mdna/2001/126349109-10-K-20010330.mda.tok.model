the decrease in the net changes in operating assets and liabilities relates primarily to the large increase in december  billed accounts receivable  for the reasons stated above 
the company s cash flows from operating activities for would have been in excess of million if the payment due date on the particular software transaction mentioned above had not been scheduled into the increase of million  or  in over relates to a million increase in net cash flows from operations  in addition to an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the company experienced a slight degradation in certain of its financial measures of liquidity as of and for the quarter and year ended december   as discussed in the three previous paragraphs  primarily as a result of the payment terms on the large software transaction mentioned above 
the company does not view the increase in the december  billed trade accounts receivable balance and the corresponding increase in the fourth quarter dbos as a concern for increased collectibility risk  evidenced by the large amount of the receivables collected subsequent to yearend 
the company anticipates that it will be able to return to its historical dbo levels of to days in the future 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for the quarter and year ended december   were directly related to the increase in the billed accounts receivable as of december  the company views this as a short term consequence only  and over time  the company believes it will continue to generate a significant amount of cash flows from operating activities in the future

mediaone in during the years ended december   and  revenues generated from at t broadband and affiliated companies at t represented approximately   and of total revenues  respectively 
there are inherent risks whenever this large of a percentage of total revenues is concentrated with one client 
one such risk is that  should at t s business generally decline or not grow as rapidly as anticipated  it would have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
at t demand for arbitration 
on september   the company received a demand for arbitration from at t relating to the master subscriber management system agreement the at t contract the companies entered into in the arbitration demand contained three claims

at t claimed that the company had breached the most favored nation clause of the agreement 
on october   at t agreed to dismiss with prejudice its demand for arbitration with the company 
in connection with the dismissal  the companies agreed to amend the at t contract 
a copy of the contract amendment is included in the exhibits to the company s september  report on form q 
the amendment includes  among other things  the following key provisions 
at t agreed to use its best efforts to convert of the recently acquired mediaone video and high speed data customers to the company s processing system by december   and the remaining by june  excluded from this obligation are any such customers that are sold or exchanged or under contract to do the same by at t prior to december  the company expects to start converting the mediaone customers estimated at approximately million total customers onto its systems in the first quarter of once at t is processing certain incremental customers on the company s system  at t shall benefit from specified  tiered processing fees 
the company does not believe this pricing change will have a material impact to its annual processing revenue per customer account 

the company waived certain exclusivity rights pertaining to residential wireline telephony ie  at t s cable telephony initiative 
at the time the amendment was executed  the company believed at t was in the process of determining its overall cable telephony architecture in support of its rollout efforts  and wanted more flexibility to determine which vendors should participate in that strategy 
in january  at t announced it had signed an agreement with another vendor to support its cable telephony initiative 
csg has agreed to provide assistance in migrating at t s cable telephony customers currently processed on the company s systems to the customer care and billing system of at t s designated vendor 
the company does not believe the loss of the at t cable telephony processing business will have a material impact on the company s results of operations 

at t purchased expanded software licenses for the company s call center and workforce automation applications 
at t is expected to use the additional software licenses over the next months as part of its rollout of these software products to support more markets and the conversion of the mediaone customers to the company s processing system 
contract rights and obligations as amended 
the at t contract expires in the at t contract has minimum financial commitments over the term of the contract and includes exclusive rights to provide customer care and billing products and services for at t s offerings of wireline video  all internet high speed data services  and print and mail services 
the at t contract contains certain performance criteria and other obligations to be met by the company 
the company is required to perform certain remedial efforts and is subject to certain penalties if it fails to meet the performance criteria or other obligations 
the company also is subject to an annual technical audit to determine whether the company s products and services include innovations in features and functions that have become standard in the wireline video industry 
the company expects to perform successfully under the at t contract  and is hopeful that it can continue to sell products and services to at t that are in excess of the minimum financial commitments and exclusive rights included in the contract 
should the company fail to meet its obligations under the at t contract  and should at t be successful in any action to either terminate the at t contract in whole or in part  or collect damages caused by an alleged breach  it would have a material impact on the company s results of operations

market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the company utilizes a derivative financial instrument to manage its interest rate risk from the variable rate features of its long term debt 
the company had long term debt including current maturities of million as of december  interest rates for the debt are chosen at the option of the company and are based on the libor rate or the prime rate  plus an additional percentage spread  with the spread dependent upon the company s leverage ratio 
as of december   the spread on the libor rate and prime rate was and  respectively 
as of december   the entire amount of the debt was under a one month libor contract  with an interest rate of ie  libor at plus spread of 
the carrying amount of the company s long term debt approximates fair value due to its variable interest rate features 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of the long term debt and scheduled principal payments 
in december  the company entered into a three year interest rate collar with a major bank to manage its risk from its variable rate long term debt 
upon expiration of this collar agreement in december  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a major bank  which expires at the maturity date of the long term debt in september the cost of the cap agreement was minimal 
the interest rate cap is libor and the underlying notional amount covered by the cap agreement was million as of december   and decreases over the term of the agreement in relation to the scheduled principal payments on the long term debt 
there are no amounts receivable under this cap agreement as of december   and the collar and the cap agreements had no effect on the company s interest expense for   or at december   the fair value of the cap agreement is not recognized in the company s financial statements 
the fair value of the cap agreement at december   based on a quoted market price  was less than  foreign exchange rate risk 
the company does not utilize any derivative financial instruments for purposes of managing its foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s foreign currency transactions relate almost entirely to the operations conducted through its united kingdom uk subsidiary  csgi 
csgi s transactions are executed primarily within the uk and generally are denominated in british pounds 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated by the fact that purchases and sales are typically in the same currency with similar maturity dates and amounts 
a hypothetical adverse change of in yearend exchange rates would not have a material effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
market risk related to short term investments 
the company does not utilize any derivative financial instruments for purposes of managing its market risks related to short term investments 
the company generally invests its excess cash balance in low risk  short term investments to limit its exposure to market risks 
the day to day management of the company s short term investments is done by the money management branch of one of the largest financial institutions in the united states 
this financial institution manages the company s short term investments based upon strict and formal investment guidelines established by the company 
under these guidelines  investments are limited to highly liquid  short term government and corporate securities that have a credit rating of a p or better 
prior measures of operating performance in and  the company disclosed certain operating results on an adjusted basis as its primary measure of operating performance 
operating results on an adjusted basis were computed by i excluding acquisition related charges  ii using an effective income tax rate of  and iii using outstanding shares on a diluted basis 
the acquisition related charges related to the csg acquisition 
substantially all of the acquisition related charges became fully amortized by november  as a result  in  the company began disclosing actual  reported operating results as its primary measure of operating performance for both the current and prior reporting periods  as the acquisition related charges were not considered significant in and the company s previous disclosure for operating income  net income  and earnings per diluted share on an adjusted basis i for the year ended december  were million  million  and per diluted share  respectively  and ii for the year ended december   were million  million  and per diluted share  respectively 
use of these operating measures on an adjusted basis as a basis of comparability for and instead of the actual reported amounts would result in different measures of operating improvement
