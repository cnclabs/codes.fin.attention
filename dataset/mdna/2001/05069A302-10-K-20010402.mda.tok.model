the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements and information relating to our company 
we generally identify forward looking statements in this prospectus using words like believe  intend  will  expect  may  should  plan  project  contemplate  anticipate  seek or similar terminology 
these statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions we made using information currently available to us 
because these statements reflect our current views concerning future events  these statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
overview we provide internet delivered premium spoken audio content for streaming and playback on personal computers and hand held digital audio players 
we have the largest and most diverse collection of premium digital spoken audio content available for purchase and download from the internet  most of which is currently available only through audible 
com 
we were incorporated in  commenced commercial operations in october  and through march   we were in the development stage for financial reporting purposes 
subsequent to march   we substantially completed our development efforts in establishing our business and accordingly no longer consider ourselves a development stage company 
in order to test consumer behavior  demonstrate to content providers the viability of digital distribution of audio content and test our business model  we designed  created and sold limited numbers of our own internet enabled mobile audio playback device  the audible mobileplayer 
sales of the mobileplayer accounted for of our revenue in  and of our revenue in hardware revenue in represents revenue from the sale of audibleready digital audio players  primarily the rio  manufactured by sonicblue incorporated s rio audio group 
hardware revenue accounted for of our revenue in digital audio players are sold from www 
audible 
com at a deep discount from normal retail price  when a customer enrolls in audiblelistener for a month period 
revenue from the sale of audio content and services has increased in each of the last four quarters 
we expect that trend to continue as sales of audio content and services increase and eventually account for the majority of our revenue 
as of december   more than  customers had purchased content from our web site 
although we have experienced revenue growth in our content sales in recent periods  there can be no assurance that such growth rates are sustainable  and therefore such growth rates should not be considered indicative of future operating results 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our revenue or attain profitability or  if increases in revenue and profitability are achieved  that they can be sustained 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we recognize revenue from content sales in the period when content is downloaded and the customer s credit card is processed 
we recognize revenue from content subscriptions pro rata over the subscription term 
typically  we pay our content providers a royalty based upon net sales of the content downloaded by our customers 
the majority of our content agreements require us to make advance royalty payments for minimum guarantees which are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement or are expensed as royalties are earned  whichever is sooner 
in addition  the company periodically adjusts the balance of royalty advances to reflect their estimated net realizable value 
we recognize revenue from sales of digital audio players upon shipment 
we recognize revenue from audio production and hosting services which we provide to corporations as the services are performed 
in november  we entered into an agreement with microsoft corporation microsoft  one of our stockholders  to integrate some of our products  grant various rights and licenses and provide for microsoft to be paid future royalties for content distributed as a result of the customized software developed under the agreement 
microsoft committed a minimum of  in payments to us over the course of the five year term of the agreement to integrate products and acquire various rights and licenses 
microsoft advanced audible  in november in consideration of audible granting microsoft the right to distribute software enabling users of microsoft platforms to access and use audible content 
the company has allocated  of this advance to certain development work that will be recognized as a reduction of research and development expense upon its completion 
the remaining  of this advance is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis which began in the quarter ended june  through the initial term of the agreement which ends in the second quarter of during the years ended december  and   and  respectively  of this advance was recognized as other revenue 
we are party to several joint marketing agreements with device manufacturers such as casio  compaq  sonicblue incorporated s rio audio group and hewlett packard 
under these agreements  device manufacturers may receive a portion of the revenue generated over a specified period of time by each new audible customer referred by them through the purchase of a new player 
for example  a purchaser of compaq s hand held electronic device will be able to use the device and our audiblemanager software to access audible 
com and download content 
compaq will receive a percentage of the revenue related to content downloaded by this purchaser 
these revenue sharing arrangements typically last one or two years from the date the player user becomes an audible customer 
in january  the company entered into two agreements with amazon 
com 
as defined in the co branding  marketing and distribution agreement  the company is the exclusive provider of digital spoken audio to amazon 
com 
in january   the company signed amendment no 
to it s co branding  marketing  and distribution agreement with amazon 
com 
during the three year term of this agreement  in consideration for certain services  amazon will receive  plus a specified percentage of revenue earned over a threshold amount in addition to common stock warrants 
under the securities purchase agreement dated january   amazon 
com purchased  shares of common stock from the company for  in february  microsoft purchased  shares of audible series a redeemable convertible preferred stock for  at a per share price of 
each share of preferred stock may be converted into four shares of common stock  equivalent to a price of 
per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the original issue date 
dividends are payable semi annually at a annual rate of in either additional preferred shares or in cash at the option of the company 
on the fifth anniversary of the original issue date  audible is required to redeem all remaining outstanding shares at a per share price of plus all accrued and unpaid dividends

factors affecting operating results we have only a limited operating history with which to evaluate our business and prospects 
our limited operating history and emerging nature of the market for internet delivered audio content makes predicting our future operating results difficult 
in addition  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in the early stages of development in new and rapidly evolving markets  specifically the rapidly evolving market for delivery of audio content over the internet 
these risks include our ability to o acquire and retain customers  o build awareness and acceptance of audible 
com  the audibleready format and audibleready devices  o extend existing and acquire new content provider relationships  and 
o manage growth to stay competitive and fulfill customer demand 
if we fail to manage these risks successfully  it would materially adversely affect our financial performance 
as of december   we had not entered into any derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity investments that expose us to material market risk 
we currently do not and do not plan to engage in derivative instruments or hedging activities 
we have incurred significant losses since inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we believe that our success will depend largely on our ability to extend our leadership position as a provider of premium digital spoken audio content over the internet 
accordingly  we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing  content acquisition and production over the next several quarters 
our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our short operating history and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include but are not limited to the demand for the audible service  the availability of premium audio content  sales and consumer usage of audibleready devices  the introduction of new products or services by a competitor  the cost and availability of acquiring sufficient web site capacity to meet our customers needs  technical difficulties with our computer system or the internet or system downtime  the cost of acquiring audio content  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to electronic commerce and online media 
in the past  we experienced fluctuations in demand for the audible service based on the level of marketing expenditures  the occurrence of external publicity and the quality of our software and web site 
any one of these factors could cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly in the future 
in addition  as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment  we may from time to time make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could cause significant declines in our quarterly operating revenue 
our limited operating history and the emerging nature of our market make prediction of future revenue difficult 
we have no assurance that we will be able to predict our future revenue accurately 
because we have a number of fixed expenses  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in relation to our expectations could cause significant declines in our operating results 
we believe that our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future  and that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through the date prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations through private sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants 
net proceeds from the sales of redeemable convertible stock and warrants were  since inception 
in july  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
total proceeds were  net of underwriting discounts and commissions of  and offering costs of  concurrent with the offering  all shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was  in cash and cash equivalents  and  in short term treasury bill and government agency note investments 
at december   our principal commitments consisted of our obligations under our capital lease line  which allows us to purchase up to  of equipment  operating lease commitments  contractual commitments with content providers  revenue sharing commitments pursuant to agreements with device manufacturers  and commitments under our agreements with amazon 
com and random house 
at december   we had leased  in equipment on the lease line  of which  was disposed of and written off during  and had an outstanding lease obligation of  in january  we entered into a three year co branding  marketing and distribution agreement with amazon 
com 
in january  we signed amendment no 
to the agreement 
under the amended agreement  our remaining obligation consists of cash payments of  in and  in in may  we entered into a four year co publishing  marketing  and distribution agreement with random house to form a strategic alliance to establish random house audible  a publishing imprint 
audible is obligated to contribute  annually for four years towards the funding of random house audible 
as of december    of the first year obligation had been paid 
net cash used in operating activities was  for   for and  for net cash used in was primarily attributable to our net operating loss and increases in inventory  offset in part by increases in advances 
net cash used in was primarily attributable to our net operating loss and increases in interest receivable on short term investments and increases in prepaid expenses  offset in part by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in was primarily attributable to our net operating loss  increases in royalty advances and accounts receivable and a decrease in advances  offset in part by increases in accounts payable  accrued compensation and royalty obligations 
net cash used in investing activities was  for  and  for net cash provided by investing activities was  for net cash used in investing activities in was related to purchases of property and equipment 
for  in addition to purchases of property and equipment of  we invested  in a interest bearing note issued to a stockholder as well as purchased  in short term investments 
net cash provided by investing activities for was primarily related to the  in net redemptions of short term investments and the  repayment of a note issued to a shareholder  offset in part by  of purchases of property and equipment 
capital expenditures for are expected to be minimal 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for   for and  for during  we had a  bank agreement to provide letters of credit which expired in april and under which we did not draw any amounts 
net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of our redeemable convertible preferred stock during and  from the proceeds of our initial public offering during  and during from the sale of common stock and repayment of notes due from shareholders offset in part by capital lease payments 
as of december   we had available net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately  which expire beginning in the tax reform act of imposes limitations on our use of net operating loss carryforwards because certain stock ownership changes have occurred 
on february   microsoft purchased  shares of audible series a redeemable convertible preferred stock for  at a per share price of 
each share of preferred stock may be converted into four shares of common stock  equivalent to a price of 
per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the original issue date 
dividends are payable semi annually at a annual rate of either in additional preferred shares or in cash at the option of the company 
on the fifth anniversary of the original issue date  audible is required to redeem all remaining outstanding shares at a per share price of plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
based on the company s currently proposed plans and assumptions related to the implementation of its business plan  we believe that our cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances together with the recent microsoft investment described above will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures into the first quarter of however  any projection of future revenues is subject to a level of uncertainty  therefore we have developed a plan that will allow the company to reduce its expense base and reduce its cash requirements if planned revenues are not achieved 
if current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and the  received from microsoft in february are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements in  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements 
beyond the first quarter of  we will require additional cash to fund our ongoing working capital and capital expenditures 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing  when needed  will be available on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders  if at all  and that such financing would not be antidilutive to our stockholders 
new accounting standards in the second quarter of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
which defers the effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company currently does not use derivative instruments and as such believes the adoption of sfas no 
 beginning january   will have no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors 
we have a limited operating history with which you can evaluate our business and our future prospects 
our limited operating history and small number of customers makes predicting our future operating results difficult 
from the time we were incorporated in november until september  we generated no revenue while we developed our secure delivery system and a prototype audio playback device  created our audible 
com web site and established relationships with providers of audio content 
although we began earning limited revenue in october  we have continued to focus our resources on refining and enhancing our web site and our playback and management software and in expanding our content selections and developing relationships with manufacturers of hand held portable digital audio players 
we have limited history of selling content and content subscription services to users of hand held portable electronic devices manufactured by other parties 
we expect to spend significant resources on growing our customer base and expanding our service and promoting our brand name 
these activities will result in significant losses until such time as the company is able to generate sufficient revenue to support its operations 
we have limited revenue  we have a history of losses  we may not be profitable in the future  and we will need additional financing 
our limited revenue and history of losses makes it uncertain when or if we will become profitable 
our failure to achieve profitability within the time frame expected by investors may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
we had total revenue of  and  for and  respectively 
this limited revenue makes it difficult to predict our future quarterly results and our revenue and operating results can vary significantly quarter to quarter 
our limited revenue will make relatively minor fluctuations in revenue much more significant on a percentage basis 
our revenue is dependent on the availability and sales of audibleready players by third party manufacturers 
we had content and services revenue of  and  for and  respectively 
we had operating expenses of  and  for and  respectively 
because most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to significantly adjust our spending to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls 
if current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and the  received from microsoft in february are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements in  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements 
beyond the first quarter of  we will require additional cash to fund our ongoing working capital and capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company when needed  if at all 
this would likely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner which may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
as of december   we have incurred net operating losses of approximately  since inception  and we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
the market for our service is uncertain and consumers may not be willing to use the internet to purchase spoken audio content 
there can be no assurance that the company s current business strategy will enable it to achieve profitable operations 
downloading of audio content from the internet is a relatively new method of distribution and its growth and market acceptance is highly uncertain 
our success will depend in large part on consumer willingness to purchase and download spoken audio content over the internet 
purchasing this content over the internet involves changing purchasing habits  and if consumers are not willing to purchase and download this content over the internet  our revenue will be limited and our business will be materially adversely affected 
we believe that acceptance of this method of distribution may be subject to network capacity constraints  hardware limitations  company computer security policies  the ability to change user habits and the quality of the audio content delivered 
we may not be able to license or produce sufficiently compelling audio content to attract and retain customers and grow our revenue 
if we are unable to obtain licenses from the creators and publishers of content to have that content available on our web site on terms acceptable to us or if a significant number of content providers terminate their agreements with us  we would have less content available for our customers  which would limit our revenue growth and materially adversely affect our financial performance 
our future success depends upon our ability to accumulate and deliver premium spoken audio content over the internet 
although we currently collaborate with the publishers of periodicals and other branded print materials to convert their written material into original spoken audio content  the majority of our content originates from producers of audiobooks  radio broadcasts  conferences  lectures and other forms of spoken audio content 
although many of our agreements with content providers are for initial terms of one to three years  our content providers may choose not to renew their agreements with us or may terminate their agreements early if we do not fulfill our contractual obligations 
we cannot be certain that our content providers will enter into new agreements with us on the same or similar terms as those currently in effect or that additional content providers will enter into agreements on terms acceptable to us 
manufacturers of electronic devices may not manufacture  make available or sell a sufficient number of products suitable for our service  which would limit our revenue growth 
if manufacturers of electronic devices do not manufacture  make available or sell a sufficient number of players promoted as audibleready  or if these players do not achieve sufficient market acceptance  we will not be able to grow revenue and our business will be materially adversely affected 
manufacturers of electronic devices have experienced delays in their delivery schedule of their digital players due to parts shortages and other factors 
although the content we sell can be played on personal computers  we believe that a key to our future success is the ability to playback this content on hand held electronic devices that have digital audio capabilities 
because we no longer manufacture our own audibleready players  we depend on manufacturers  such as sonicblue incorporated  philips  casio  and compaq  to develop and sell their own products and promote them as audibleready 
we must establish  maintain and strengthen our brand names  trademarks and service marks in order to acquire customers and generate revenue 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brand names  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that building awareness of the audible  audible 
com and audibleready brand names is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our service by customers  content providers  device manufacturers and marketing and distribution companies with which we have business relationships 
to promote our brands  we will need to substantially increase our marketing expenditures 
we have applied for registration in the united states of several of our trademark and service marks  including audiblelistener  audible hear  there  and everywhere  audibleready and who you gonna listen to 
we cannot assure you that these trademarks and service marks will be granted 
increasing availability of digital audio technologies may increase competition and reduce our gross margins  market share and profitability 
if we do not continue to enhance our service and adapt to new technology  we will not be able to compete with new and existing distributors of spoken audio  we will lose market share and our business will be materially adversely effected 
the market for the audible service is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as advances in and standardization of digital audio distribution  download  security  management and playback technologies reduce the cost of starting a digital audio delivery system or a service that gathers audio content 
to remain competitive  we must continue to either license or internally develop technology that will enhance the features of the audible service  our software that manages the downloading and playback of audio content  our ability to compress audio files for downloading and storage and our download  security and playback technologies 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance 
our industry is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively 
we face competition in all aspects of our business and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively 
we compete for consumers of audio content with other internet based audio distributors and distributors of audio on cassette tape or compact disk 
we compete with others for relationships with manufacturers of electronic devices with audio playback capabilities 
the business of providing content over the internet is experiencing rapid growth and is characterized by rapid technological changes  changes in consumer habits and preferences and the emergence of new and established companies 
we compete with traditional and online retail stores  catalogs  clubs and libraries that sell  rent or loan audiobooks on cassette tape or compact disk  such as audio book club  borders  and barnes noble  web sites that offer streaming access to spoken audio content using tools such as the realplayer or windows media player  such as yahoo broadcast 
com  other companies offering services similar to ours  such as media bay and on line and internet portal companies such as america online  inc  yahoo inc  and microsoft network  with the potential to offer audio content 
many of these companies have financial  technological  promotional and other resources that are much greater than those available to us and could use or adapt their current technology  or could purchase technology  to provide a service directly competitive with the audible service 
capacity constraints and failures  delays or overloads could interrupt our service and reduce the attractiveness of our service to existing or potential customers 
any capacity constraints or sustained failure or delay in using our web site could reduce the attractiveness of the audible service to consumers  which would materially adversely affect our financial performance 
our success depends on our ability to electronically distribute spoken audio content through our web site to a large number of customers efficiently and with few interruptions or delays 
accordingly  the performance  reliability and availability of our web site  our transaction processing systems and our network infrastructure are critical to our operating results 
we have experienced periodic systems interruptions including planned system maintenance  hardware and software failures triggered by high traffic levels  and network failure in the internet and our internet service providers 
we believe the complexities of our software and hardware and the potential instability of the internet due to rapid user growth mean that periodic interruptions to our service are likely to continue 
a significant increase in visitors to our web site or simultaneous download requests could strain the capacity of our web site  software  hardware and telecommunications systems  which could lead to slower response times or system failures 
these interruptions may make it difficult to download audio content from our web site in a timely manner 
we could be liable for substantial damages if there is unauthorized duplication of the content we sell 
we believe that we are able to license premium audio content in part because our service has been designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized duplication and playback of audio files 
if these security measures fail  our content may be vulnerable to unauthorized duplication playback 
if others duplicate the content we provide without authorization  content providers may terminate their agreements with us and hold us liable for substantial damages 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including insurance for errors or omissions  we cannot assure you that the amount of coverage will be adequate to compensate us for these losses 
security breaches might also discourage other content providers from entering into agreements with us 
we may be required to expend substantial money and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
we do not have a disaster recovery plan or back up systems  and a disaster could severely damage our operations 
if our computer systems are damaged or interrupted by a disaster for an extended period of time  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we do not have a disaster recovery plan in effect and do not have fully redundant systems for the audible service at an alternate site 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  all of which are located in our headquarters and at two third party offsite hosting facilities 
although we maintain insurance against general business interruptions  we cannot assure you that the amount of coverage will be adequate to compensate us for our losses 
problems associated with the internet could discourage use of internet based services like ours 
if the internet fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect as a commercial medium  our business may also grow more slowly than we anticipate  if at all 
our success will depend in large part on increasing use of the internet 
there are critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet which we expect to affect the development of the market for the audible service  including o the secure transmission of customer credit card numbers and other confidential information  o the reliability and availability of internet service providers  o the cost of access to the internet  o the availability of sufficient network capacity  and o the ability to download audio content through computer security measures employed by businesses 
the loss of key employees could jeopardize our growth prospects 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could materially adversely affect our business 
our future success depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly thomas g 
baxter  our president and ceo  and donald r 
katz  our founder and chairman of the board 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key employees 
our inability to hire new employees may hurt our growth prospects 
the failure to hire new personnel could damage our ability to grow and expand our business 
our future success depends on our ability to attract  hire and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  editorial  marketing and customer service personnel  and competition for these individuals is intense 
in particular  we have experienced difficulty in hiring software and web site developers 
our failure to hire these technical employees could delay improvements in  and enhancements to  the audible service 
we have no experience in acquiring companies or technologies and any acquisitions of this type may disrupt our business or distract our management  due to difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel and operations 
we have no experience in acquiring businesses  technologies  services or products 
from time to time  we engage in discussions and negotiations with companies regarding our acquiring or investing in such companies businesses  products  services or technologies 
if we acquire or invest in another company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel  operations  technology and software 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
if we make other types of acquisitions  we could have difficulty in integrating the acquired products  services or technologies into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
as of this date we have no agreement to enter into any material investment or acquisition transaction 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  we may be exposed to expensive litigation or risk jeopardizing our competitive position 
the steps we have taken may be inadequate to protect our technology and other intellectual property 
our competitors may learn or discover our trade secrets or may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
we rely on a combination of patents  licenses  confidentiality agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights 
we hold six patents and have filed five other patent applications 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to maintain our competitive position 
we may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management and technical resources which would harm our business 
other companies may claim that we infringe their copyrights or patents 
if the audible service violates the proprietary rights of others  we may be required to redesign our software  and re encode the audible content  or seek to obtain licenses from others to continue offering the audible service without substantial redesign and such efforts may not be successful 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether our technology infringes patents held by others 
in addition  software development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
a party making a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering the audible service 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be sued for content that we distribute over the internet 
a lawsuit based on the content we distribute could be expensive and damaging to our business 
our service involves delivering spoken audio content to our customers 
as a distributor and publisher of content over the internet  we may be liable for copyright  trademark infringement  unlawful duplication  negligence  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we publish or distribute to customers 
although we generally require that our content providers indemnify us for liability based on their content and we carry general liability insurance  the indemnity and the insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to protect us from the full amount of the liability 
if we are found liable in excess of the amount of indemnity or of our insurance coverage  we could be liable for substantial damages and our reputation and business may suffer 
future government regulations may increase our cost of doing business on the internet 
laws and regulations applicable to the internet covering issues such as user privacy  pricing and copyrights are becoming more prevalent 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet could force us to modify the audible service in ways that could adversely affect our business 
we may become subject to sales and other taxes for direct sales over the internet 
increased tax burden could make our service too expensive to be competitive 
we do not currently collect sales or other similar taxes for download of content into states other than in new jersey 
nevertheless  one or more local  state or foreign jurisdictions may require that companies located in other states collect sales taxes when engaging in online commerce in those states 
if we open facilities in other states  our sales into such states may be taxable 
if one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our content  the increased cost to our customers could discourage them from purchasing our services  which would materially adversely affect our business 
our contractual obligations  charter and by laws could discourage an acquisition of our company that would benefit our stockholders 
provisions of our agreement with microsoft and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if a change in control would benefit our stockholders 
these provisions include o prior to discussing with anyone the sale of our company  we must notify microsoft and microsoft has a right to negotiate exclusively with us for days to acquire our company 
we are not obligated to accept any offer from microsoft 
if we do not reach agreement during this period  we may discuss with others the sale of our company  o our board of directors  without stockholder approval  may issue preferred stock on terms that they determine 
this preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms that delay or prevent the change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult 
also  the issuance of preferred stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease  o our board of directors is staggered so that only a portion of its members are elected each year  o if  during the first year following the investment by microsoft  our board of directors approves a merger or similar transaction which indicates a per share value of our common stock of less than  each share of preferred stock issued to microsoft corporation shall be convertible into shares of our common stock at a special rate of to this provision may have the effect of making it more difficult for us to complete a merger or similar transaction 
the special conversion provisions will lapse in the event that we receive proceeds from additional financings of million or more 
o only our board of directors  our chairman of the board  our president or stockholders holding a majority of our stock can call special stockholder meetings  and o special procedures which must be followed in order for stockholders to present proposals at stockholder meetings 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in the control of our company  could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company  or may otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock
