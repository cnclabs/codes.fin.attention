the company s operations  as well as those of the building material industry generally  have reflected substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of various factors  including levels of construction activity  weather  prices of commodity wood products  general regional and local economic conditions  interest rates and the availability of credit  all of which are cyclical or seasonal in nature 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
because a substantial percentage of the company s sales are attributable to building professionals  certain of these factors may have a more significant impact on the company than on companies more heavily focused on consumers 
the company s first quarter and  occasionally  its fourth quarter are adversely affected by weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
the extent of such decreases in activity is a function of the severity of winter weather conditions 
in the first quarter of  the midwest and northeast experienced mild winter weather  but significant precipitation 
additionally  these regions also experienced a more severe winter with respect to cold temperatures and snow in the fourth quarter of than in the previous four years 
weather conditions in were relatively normal throughout the year 
during the first quarter of  the company experienced mild winter weather conditions in the company s midwest region  which was partially offset by increased precipitation in the northeast and south
