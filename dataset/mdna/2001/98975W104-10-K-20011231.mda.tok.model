item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s mission is to commercialize the use of carbon fibers as reinforcement in advanced composite materials 
the company believes it is the lowest cost producer of carbon fibers and its sales strategy is designed to attract significant new applications for carbon fiber reinforced composites in automotive  infrastructure  construction  marine and other industries 
the company believes introduction of carbon fibers to potential end users has been generally well received and the company is participating in a number of ongoing development projects in these application categories 
as part of its strategy to establish availability of carbon fibers on a scale sufficient to provide growth of large scale applications  the company completed a major carbon fiber production capacity expansion plan in fiscal the company completed construction of seven continuous carbon fiber lines  each with an annual rated capacity of one million pounds  at its abilene  texas facility five lines and zoltek rt 
facilities two lines 
in addition  the company completed construction of a secondary processing building at its abilene  texas facility to perform intermediate and secondary carbon fiber processing operations  such as chopping  milling and specialty packaging  and completed construction and partial finish out of an additional building  square feet designed to ultimately house up to more continuous carbonization lines at its abilene  texas facility 
during fiscal  the company also completed construction of an oxidization line at zoltek rt  with an annual rated capacity of two million pounds 
the company is supplying european markets with oxidized fiber used in friction and thermal applications from this line 
as the company pursues its application and market development efforts  the company has found the existing composite materials value chain relatively slow to change and undertook steps to accelerate the introduction and development of carbon fiber composites across a broad range of mass market applications 
the company is continuing to target emerging applications for low cost  high performance carbons in automobile manufacturing  alternate energy technologies  deep sea oil drilling applications  filament winding applications  buoyancy and fire resistant applications 
the company acquired a series of downstream businesses during fiscal  with the objective of accelerating the introduction and development of carbon fibers and carbon fiber composites in low cost  high volume applications 
the company s strategy includes providing direct input into the composites value chain by supplying composite engineering and design technology  composite processing technology and the ability to create integrated product solutions utilizing composite materials 
in october  zoltek acquired zoltek materials group  inc zoltek materials group  located in san diego  california  is a manufacturer of carbon fiber prepreg pre impregnated with resin composite materials 
in november  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of engineering technology corporation entec composite machines 
entec  located in salt lake city  utah  designs and manufactures filament winding equipment used in the production of composite parts 
also in november  the company acquired composite machines corporation cmc and ramal international  inc parent company of cmc 
cmc  located in salt lake city  utah  designed and manufactured filament winding and pultrusion equipment used in the production of composite parts 
cmc and ramal have been integrated into the entec operation 
additionally  in november  the company acquired structural polymer holdings ltd 
sp systems  which designs and manufactures composite materials used in large scale structures such as wind turbine blades and marine structures 
while this acquisition was consistent with the company s business strategy  the financial performance of this business was unsatisfactory 
therefore  in fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to sell this subsidiary 
in november  the company sold sp systems and entered into various agreements that provide for various continuing relationships  including a ten year carbon fiber supply agreement 
in april  the company acquired a preferred membership interest in hardcore composites operations llc hardcore 
hardcore designs and manufactures composite structures for the civil infrastructure market 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to dispose of its interests in hardcore 
the company expects that the disposition of hardcore will be completed by the end of fiscal the company s consolidated financial statements for fiscal and account for hardcore and sp systems as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to the company s continuing operations 
the company s carbon fiber manufacturing capacity continues to be underutilized 
carbon fiber sales have been depressed by excess capacity across the industry  distressed pricing across most existing markets and weakening economic conditions globally 
carbon fiber sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal the company s strategy for near term sales increases was to rely primarily on what had been two fast growing commercial markets conductive plastics used in electronic products and sporting goods 
in fiscal  the growth in these two markets slowed dramatically 
in addition  sales of carbon fibers into commercial markets have been slower to develop than expected due to long lead times in product development for large scale applications 
for these reasons  the company has temporarily idled the plant in abilene  texas 
the excess capacity costs related to the carbon fiber business totaled million in in fiscal  these excess capacity costs are forecasted to be approximately million 
comparison of results for fiscal years ended september  and the company s sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  carbon fiber sales decreased due to excess carbon fiber capacity that resulted in distressed pricing across most existing markets and by weakening economic conditions globally 
sales of the composite intermediates business segment increased to million in fiscal from million is fiscal the increase resulted from higher volume in the prepreg markets 
sales of acrylic and other products produced at zoltek rt 
were comparable year over year million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal an inventory value reduction of million recorded in fiscal  to reflect a lower of cost or market adjustment  was the primary component of the gross profit reduction 
the inventory value reduction was established due to the intensified overcapacity occurring in the year  which caused distressed pricing across most existing markets for carbon fibers 
without the inventory reduction  gross profit would have been million  a reduction year over year 
gross margin from carbon fibers decreased to a negative million in fiscal from a positive million in fiscal the margin percentage on carbon fiber decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to the inventory value reduction 
gross profit on carbon fibers before the inventory adjustment was million  or  a decrease of million  or due primarily to competitive pricing pressures in the market 
gross profit on composite intermediates was negative million in fiscal compared to a positive million in fiscal these downstream businesses continue to actively participate in development projects that generate little margin at current volume levels  however  such projects are intended to develop new applications for carbon fibers to expand their commercial use 
gross profit from acrylic and other products sold by zoltek rt  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margin on acrylic fibers and other products decreased to of sales for fiscal compared to of sales for fiscal due primarily to increases in raw material costs that could not be passed on to customers 
during fiscal years and  the company was not operating its continuous carbonization lines at the abilene  texas facility at full capacity resulting in available unused capacity charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
these costs include depreciation and other overhead charges 
the company believes it is necessary to maintain available capacity to encourage development of significant new large scale applications and anticipates costs associated with the available capacity will continue into fiscal the company does  however  anticipate increases in carbon fiber sales from both the us and hungarian locations in fiscal application and development costs were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  representing a million increase 
this increase was due to increased costs related to the carbon fiber operations due to product and market development efforts for product trials  and for additional sales and product development personnel and travel 
targeted emerging applications include automobile manufacturing  alternate energy technologies  deep sea oil drilling  filament winding and buoyancy 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to salaries and other personnel related costs 
interest expense was approximately million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from borrowings related to the use of funds for working capital and capital expenditures 
interest income was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income increased due to higher average balances invested  including notes from sale of business 
during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million 
during fiscal  the company reported an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset in fiscal that caused the company to recognize a lower income tax benefit in fiscal  even though the company reported significantly greater pre tax losses than in the prior year 
the company recognizes income taxes in both the united states and hungary based on the income before income taxes 
included in the provision for income taxes are gross receipts taxes charged by the hungarian local taxing authorities  which were million in fiscal year and  as well as the statutory income taxes 
the statutory income tax rate for the zoltek rt 
operation in hungary is 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported a net loss from continuing operations per share of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal year due to the repurchase of approximately million common shares as partial consideration for the sale of sp systems in november in the fourth quarter  the company formally adopted a plan to dispose of its interest in hardcore 
the net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal included a million loss from the results of operations of hardcore  a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of hardcore s net assets to their fair value less estimated selling costs  and a million loss from discontinued operations of sp systems 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from discontinued operations of million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  in fiscal  and million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  in fiscal the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal comparison of results for fiscal years ended september  and the company s sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  the increase in carbon fiber sales volumes was partially offset by distressed pricing due to significant overcapacity in the industry 
the composites intermediates acquisitions during fiscal accounted for million of sales 
sales of acrylic and other products produced at zoltek rt 
decreased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was principally due to volume reductions in the company s production capacity 
the company converted its mavilon acrylic fiber plant to carbon fiber precursor production during the last half of  permanently removing the capacity from the acrylic textile fiber operation 
the mavilon plant produced approximately  metric tons of material in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit from carbon fibers decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the gross profit percentage on carbon fiber decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal due to selling price decreases and product mix changes 
gross margin for the composite intermediates acquired in fiscal was million 
gross profit from acrylic and other products sold by zoltek rt  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margin on acrylic fibers and other products increased to of sales for fiscal from of sales for fiscal due primarily to higher sales demand 
during fiscal years and  the company was not operating its new continuous carbonization lines at full capacity  resulting in available unused capacity charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
application and development costs in fiscal were million  a increase versus million in fiscal this increase was due to product and market development efforts for product trials  additional sales product development personnel and travel  primarily in carbon fibers 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal offsetting the million increase caused by the composite intermediates acquisitions during was an overall reduction in personnel and administrative expenses  primarily at zoltek rt 
interest expense was approximately million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from borrowings related to the use of funds for the composite intermediates acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures 
interest income was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income was due to the use of funds to finance the acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures during fiscal and during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million 
during fiscal  the company reported an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal due to the increased losses from operations before taxes 
the company recognizes income taxes in both the united states and hungary based on the income before income taxes 
included in the provision for income taxes are gross receipts taxes charged by the hungarian local taxing authorities  which were and million in fiscal year and  respectively  as well as the statutory income taxes 
the statutory income tax rate for the zoltek rt 
operation in hungary is 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported net loss from continuing operations per share of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal year due to the issuance of approximately million common shares as partial consideration for the purchase of sp systems 
the net loss from discontinued operations includes the results of operations of hardcore and sp systems and interest costs related to borrowings used to finance the sp acquisition 
the net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year was million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal and prior years  the company s primary sources of liquidity were cash flow from operating activities and available borrowing capacity under credit facilities  supplemented with the net proceeds from three equity offerings  and long term debt financing utilizing the equity in the company s real estate properties 
during much of fiscal and  the carbon fiber market experienced excess supply resulting from capacity increases by several other carbon fiber manufacturers 
as a result  the company experienced substantial reductions in selling prices and related gross profit across most existing markets 
the company expects market conditions similar to fiscal to continue until the market demand consumes the excess capacity 
however  the company plans to reduce its carbon fiber inventory  to rationalize its work force to reflect current and near term demand and to significantly reduce operating expenses 
management s objective is to operate the continuing business on a cash flow neutral basis by the end of fiscal on may   the company entered into a new two year credit facility with southwest bank of st 
louis in the amount of million 
the credit facility is structured as a term loan in the amount of million  and a revolving credit loan in the amount of million 
the company used the proceeds of the new facility to repay existing borrowing of million  plus accrued interest  and terminated the old credit facility 
borrowings under the new facility are based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the company s us based subsidiaries 
the outstanding loans under the agreement bear interest at the prime interest rate 
the loan agreement contains financial covenants related to borrowings  working capital  debt coverage  current ratio  inventory turn ratio  and capital expenditures 
the company issued warrants to the bank to purchase  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of per share  exercisable at any time during a five year period from the date of the loan 
in december  the company received a commitment letter from southwest bank regarding the waiver of certain financial covenants as of december  and modification of certain financial covenants for fiscal the company expects that a definitive amendment to the credit agreement will be concluded in the second quarter of fiscal on may   the company s hungarian subsidiary entered into an expanded credit facility  to million from million  with raiffeisen bank rt 
the facility consists of a million bank guarantee and factoring facility and a working capital facility  both expiring in december and a million capital investment facility that expires in the factoring facility and the working capital facility are one year agreements renewable each year 
although there is no assurance from the bank  the company expects to be able to continue extending the terms on an annual basis beyond december the company believes its financial position has been improved as a result of the recent operating cost reductions and disposal of sp systems 
the planned disposition of hardcore also will benefit the company s future liquidity position 
management believes that the company s financial resources remain adequate to support the execution of its strategic plans 
however  failure to comply with its obligations under its existing credit facilities  manage costs  and increase carbon fiber sales on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
at september   the company reported working capital excluding discontinued operations of million compared to working capital of million at september  the decrease in working capital from september  to september  was primarily due to use of cash and temporary investments of million for operations  the repayment of the current portion of the former credit facility of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and a reduction in inventory of million 
although inventories decreased from million at september  to million at september   the decrease was primarily due to recording the million reserve during fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the inventory to net realizable value 
the reserve was established due to the intensified overcapacity occurring in the year  which caused distressed pricing across most existing markets for carbon fibers 
the company anticipates that carbon fiber inventories will decrease further during fiscal  as it will continue to rationalize production levels and pursue an aggressive sales effort in existing and new markets 
the company s continuing operations used million of cash in fiscal compared to using cash of million in fiscal in fiscal  the company will seek to fund its continuing operations from borrowings and managing its working capital 
historically  cash used in investing activities has been expended for equipment additions and to support research and development of carbon fibers applications and the expansion of the company s carbon fibers production capacity 
in fiscal  the company made capital expenditures of million for various projects compared to million during the fiscal year of these expenditures in fiscal  approximately million was used for oxidation lines and secondary processing equipment for carbon fibers and million was used at zoltek rt 
for modernization and modifications to produce acrylic fiber and other industrial products 
composite intermediates had capital expenditures of approximately million for equipment additions and modifications 
these expenditures were financed principally with cash from the sale of temporary investments and from borrowings 
in fiscal  the company expects purchases of property  plant and equipment to be less than million 
in fiscal  the company placed million of assets in service that were previously classified as construction in progress 
these assets are primarily located at the abilene  texas facility and consisted of million of buildings and million of machinery and equipment 
the company began recording depreciation on these assets from the date they were placed in service 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company elected to temporarily idle the continuous carbonization lines at the abilene facility 
these carbonization lines had a carrying value of million at september  management intends to return the lines to full production as market demand for carbon fiber products increases 
current maturities of long term debt at september  include a million payment due on the term loan with southwest bank in may plus approximately million related to various mortgage notes 
as part of the company s strategic plan for commercializing carbon fibers and carbon fiber composites  the company acquired zoltek materials group and entec composite machines in november for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the company also assumed certain liabilities at acquisition and provided working capital and credit facilities for the acquired companies 
in november  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of sp systems for approximately million in cash and million shares of the company s common stock 
the company also borrowed million to refinance certain existing bank debt of sp systems and fund working capital requirements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to sell sp systems  which was completed in november the company entered into a six year credit facility with a commercial bank in an original aggregate amount of million to finance the sp systems acquisition and refinance other indebtedness 
the company amended and restated the credit agreement on may  to reduce the amount of borrowings available to million and to modify certain covenants 
the facility  as amended  contained financial covenants related to borrowings  future acquisitions  working capital  net worth  cash flow  and fixed charge coverage 
the company reduced the borrowings under the credit facility by million in november from the proceeds of the sale of sp systems 
in april  the company acquired a membership interest in hardcore for million cash and guaranteed a note payable of million 
the company also provided additional funding for working capital 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to dispose of hardcore  which it expects to complete in fiscal at the time of the purchase of its membership interest in hardcore  the company guaranteed hardcore s post closing obligations to the seller 
the company s guarantee relates to obligations of approximately million 
the obligations were payable as of april   however  these transactions have not yet been completed pending the outcome of negotiation with the seller and pending final agreement with respect to the proposed disposition of hardcore 
in february  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market over an unspecified period of time as market conditions allow 
the purpose of the repurchase plan was to meet the company s obligations under its stock option plans  while minimizing dilution to shareholders 
in connection with the approved repurchase  the company purchased  shares of the company s common stock in march and the company sold put options for  shares of the company s common stock in february and march which expired unexercised 
the put options allowed the purchasers to exercise the options and sell the shares back to the company 
in addition  put options for  shares of the company s common stock were sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which expired unexercised in january the company sold additional put options for  shares in december  which expired in july the company repurchased these put options in march there were no put options outstanding at september  and september   respectively 
the company s credit agreement currently prohibits repurchases of shares and the company does not anticipate any repurchases until its financial condition improves 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities under its credit facility 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements  but the company does not believe such risk is material 
however  a one percent increase in the weighted average interest rate of the company s debt for fiscal compared to fiscal would result in a  increase in interest expense based on debt levels at september  excluding discontinued operations
