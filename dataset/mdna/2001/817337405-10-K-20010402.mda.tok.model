item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk and uncertainties and elsewhere in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
we are a genomics company that translates information generated from the map of the human genome into useful applications 
we offer a comprehensive genotyping technology to determine the medical relevance of genetic variations  called snps or single nucleotide polymorphisms 
since we began operations in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and application of products  technologies and services to analyze snps  and  more recently  to determine their association to disease 
our products include the massarray system for large scale scoring of snps  disposable massarray kits consisting of our proprietary spectrochip and reagents  a snp assay portfolio and an allele frequency database 
our services include assay design for massarray customers  in house validation projects using our massarray system and disease association studies using our proprietary population based dna bank 
we are also using the massarray technology to identify the medical utility of snps and develop snp panels based on correlation to specific diseases on our own and in collaboration with others 
we sold our first product  the massarray system  in january through december   we have commercially placed a total of systems with leading companies and institutions 
we currently sell our products to genomics  pharmacogenomics  diagnostic and agricultural biotechnology companies  as well as leading research institutions  in the united states  europe and asia 
through december   our product revenues consisted of revenues from both the sale of massarray systems and the sale of massarray kits 
massarray kits are used in the operation of the massarray system 
our service revenues consisted of snp validation services  with revenue recognized as phases of the projects were completed 
we anticipate that revenues from our collaborations with third parties will become an increasingly important component of our service revenues in the future 
prior to january   our revenues had been solely from research grants 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
prior to january   our expenses consisted primarily of costs incurred in research and development  production scale up  business development and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
with our first commercial revenues  we began incurring cost of product revenues and significantly increased our sales and marketing expenses 
cost of product revenues includes the materials  labor and overhead expenses related to the production of and assembly of our products 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future  and expect all expenses to increase  as we expand development and commercialization of new information based products  establish a high throughput genotyping center  and fully implement our snp validation business strategies 
our planned move from our current facilities in san diego to expanded facilities in san diego in march will also add to our expenses  as the cost of exiting the current building will approximate million and will be expensed during results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues increased to approximately million in  from approximately  in and approximately  in all revenues in the years prior to resulted from research and development grants 
product revenues were million for the year ended december  these revenues were derived from the sale of massarray systems and disposable kits containing our proprietary spectrochip 
during the year  we sold of our massarray systems and sold our disposables to those that used our system 
service revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  these service revenues consisted of completion of significant phases in snp validation projects 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  materials costs and costs related to improvements of our existing products and validation of products under development 
during  our research and development resources were focused primarily on the research activities associated with strategic collaborative agreements  such as our agreement with incyte  validation of products under development  and potential improvements to our existing products 
the million increase from to consisted of approximately million in materials and other costs related to research and development of products and services and collaborative agreements  approximately million from increased personnel expenses associated with additional research and development personnel and a million charge related to forgiveness of loans granted to research and development executives in connection with the exercise of stock options 
the million increase from to resulted from the expansion of our research and development efforts and was comprised of a million increase in salaries and related personnel costs  additional material costs of million and approximately  of additional costs directly related to the scale up of manufacturing for our spectochips 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for executive  sales and marketing  and other administrative personnel  general and patent related legal expenses  and business development  customer support and sales and marketing expenses 
approximately million of the million increase from to resulted from charges related to the february forgiveness of loans granted to executives in in connection with the exercise of stock options  the transition of dr 
koster from president and chief executive officer to vice chairman of the board of directors in the second quarter of  and dr 
koster s resignation from the board of directors in the fourth quarter of the remaining increase consisted of approximately million from the expansion of our sales  marketing  business development and customer support teams to support the commercialization of our products  approximately million in additional expenses associated with our expanded facilities and other general expenses related to the overall expansion of our operations  and approximately  in additional insurance and general legal costs as a result of becoming a publicly traded company 
the million increase from to consisted of million for salaries and related personnel costs for additional administrative personnel  approximately  from expenses related to the increase in filing and pursuing patent applications  and million attributable to general expenses associated with the overall expansion of our operations 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of options at the date of grant 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation totaling million  compared to million in the amount included million related to a remeasurement of options originally granted to dr 
koster in these amounts are being amortized over the vesting periods of the individual stock options using the graded vesting method 
we expect to record amortization for deferred compensation approximately as follows  during   during  and  during interest income interest income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  and approximately  in the increase from to resulted from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in  from the investment of our february ipo proceeds of approximately million 
the increase from to resulted from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in from the investment of the proceeds from the sale of series d convertible preferred stock in december and the first quarter of interest expense interest expense increased to approximately million in  from approximately  in  and from approximately  in the million is comprised of approximately million of non cash interest expense recorded upon conversion of debt of million million german deutsche marks exchanged at a rate of deutsche marks per us dollar into common stock and approximately  of interest related to capital lease obligations  offset in part by approximately  of a non cash gain recorded upon issuance of common stock to extinguish long term interest payable 
interest expense increased from to due to higher average borrowing under a capital lease arrangement 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and  respectively  and german net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
the german net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than  which occurred during and also in connection with our initial public offering in february however  we do not believe these limitations will materially impact the use of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we completed our initial public offering ipo raising net proceeds of approximately million 
prior to our ipo  we funded our operations with million of private equity financings  million in loans and convertible loans and million from equipment financing arrangements 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million at december  our cash reserves are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including investment grade corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the same period in a net loss of million in was partially offset by non cash charges of million for amortization of deferred compensation  million for depreciation and amortization expense  million of loan forgiveness  million related to remeasurment of stock options  and an increase of million in inventories  accounts receivable and other assets 
investing activities  other than the changes in our short term investments  consumed million in cash during due to expenditures for leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in financing activities included the receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering during the year ended december  and million from the sale of preferred stock to investors in the same period in working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital was due to the ipo net proceeds  partially offset by our use of cash in operations 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million in future obligations of principal payments under capital leases  of which million will be repaid within the next year 
we used approximately million of the proceeds of our initial public offering for the repayment of long term bank debt in we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the next months 
however  the actual amount of funds that we will need during or after the next months will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include 
the level of our success in selling our massarray systems  consumables  assays and services  
the level of our sales and marketing expenses  
the extent to which we enter into collaborations or joint ventures  
our ability to introduce and sell new products and services  
the level of our expenses associated with litigation  
the costs and timing of obtaining new patent rights  
the extent to which we acquire technologies or companies  and 
regulatory changes and competition and technological developments in the market 
we have a million bank line of credit  all of which is available for borrowing 
in addition  we have established an million capital equipment financing agreement  million of which was available for utilization at december  we have no commitments for any additional financings 
if additional funds are required and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
if we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
long term debt our long term debt as of december  was denominated in german deutsche marks 
we converted approximately half of this debt into common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in february  and repaid the rest of this debt in cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering 
increases in value of the german deutsche mark relative to the us dollar before the conversion resulted in a translation loss of approximately  through the date of the conversion and repayment 
foreign currency rate fluctuations the functional currency for our german subsidiary is the deutsche mark 
the german subsidiary s accounts are translated from the german deutsche mark to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our german subsidiary conducts its business with customers in local european currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our german subsidiaries or transactions with our european customers 
the net liabilities of our german subsidiary totaled million at december  a decrease in the value of the german deutsche mark relative to the us dollar would result in an approximately  unrealized foreign translation loss 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement changes the previous accounting definition of derivative which focused on freestanding contracts such as options and forwards  including futures and swaps expanding it to include embedded derivatives and many commodity contracts 
under the statement  every derivative is recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we will adopt sfas no 
effective january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  as we do not own or utilize derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we believe our revenue recognition has complied with sab since our inception 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin 
fin clarifies certain issues in the application of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fin became effective july   but certain conclusions covered specific events that occured after either december  or january  adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements
