item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction this section includes historical information  certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our future operating results to differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by us or others 
it is important that the business discussion in item of this report and the historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
historical information historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income loss or net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
acquisitions in march  we acquired boole in a stock for stock merger 
we issued million shares of common stock in the transaction 
the transaction was accounted for using the pooling of interests method  and we have restated the prior period financial results to include those of boole for the periods presented 
in april  we acquired new dimension in a cash tender offer 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly  new dimension s financial results have been included in our fiscal financial results since the acquisition date 
in april  we acquired evity for million shares of common stock and cash of million 
stock options to purchase million common shares were issued to replace outstanding evity stock options 
in august  we acquired optisystems for cash 
these transactions  along with various other immaterial technology acquisitions  were accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly  the financial results for these entities have been included in our fiscal financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income bear to total revenues 
percentage of total revenues years ended march  revenues license maintenance professional services total revenues selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of professional services general and administrative expenses percentage of total revenues years ended march  acquired research and development amortization of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles legal settlement merger related costs and compensation charges operating income loss interest expense interest and other income  net other income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes net earnings revenues percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions license north america international total license revenues  maintenance north america international total maintenance revenues professional services north america international total professional services revenues total revenues    we generate revenues from product license fees for our computer software solutions  product maintenance and support fees for the associated maintenance  enhancement and support of these solutions and professional services fees 
we generally recognize revenue from license fees upon the execution of a software license agreement signed by both parties  the delivery of the underlying products to the customer and the acceptance of such products by the customer  determination that the software license fees are fixed and determinable and determination that collection of the fees is probable 
in instances when any one of the four revenue recognition criteria are not met  license revenue is either deferred until the criteria are met or is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis 
maintenance and support fees are recognized ratably over the maintenance term as defined in the applicable software license agreement and professional services fees are recognized as the services are provided 
for further discussion of our revenue recognition policies  refer to the discussion below and to note h to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
total revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from revenues generated by our enterprise server management solutions  particularly those for db  our application database performance management product lines  the addition of the new dimension incontrol products in a purchase accounting transaction and  to a lesser extent  growth of product maintenance and services fees 
excluding incremental revenues associated with new dimension  total revenue growth was approximately for fiscal the total revenue decline of in fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in enterprise license transactions during the year and a reduction in license upgrade fees as discussed under product license revenues below 
demand weakness was experienced across the board during fiscal by independent software vendors with mainframe product portfolios 
we believe that this indicates that external market factors contributed significantly to this weakness 
while it is impossible to assign weights to any individual factors  market factors that may have contributed to this weakness and the resultant negative effect on license revenues experienced by us and our competitors included uncertainties associated with the roll out of ibm s z series mainframe product family and workload based pricing model and continued customer absorption of capacity purchased in association with year compliance programs 
these factors also impacted revenues for our other products because many of our mainframe customers are also customers of our other products and sometimes purchase these other products together with mainframe products in enterprise solutions 
revenues from companies we acquired in purchase accounting transactions during fiscal did not provide a significant offset to the revenue declines discussed above 
though fiscal revenues were down in all quarters compared to the prior year  revenues in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal showed sequential growth over the immediately preceding quarters 
product revenue growth was only nominally impacted by price increases and inflation in fiscal and product line revenues percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions enterprise server management business integrated scheduling application database performance management recovery storage management other software total license maintenance revenues    we market over software solutions designed to improve the availability  performance and recoverability of enterprise applications  databases and other it systems components operating in mainframe  distributed computing and internet environments 
these solutions fall into the five broad categories above 
in managing our investment in these product categories we consider each to be included in one of three strategic groups 
the first group includes our enterprise server management and business integrated scheduling solutions 
our objective for this group is to extend our core strengths in these markets 
the second strategic group includes our application database performance management and recovery storage management solutions 
our objective for this group is to build our business in fast growing markets 
the last group includes our other software products  such as our security  erp  network management  business information integration  output management and service provider solutions 
the objective for this group is to make strategic investments in what we anticipate will be sources of future growth 
our enterprise server management and business integrated scheduling solutions combined represented  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group grew from fiscal to fiscal and declined from fiscal to fiscal revenue growth in fiscal included the impact of the acquisition of new dimension and its scheduling products 
because this group includes a high proportion of mainframe solutions  the external market factors discussed above were the primary cause of the revenue decline in fiscal  more than offsetting the revenue growth for our business integrated scheduling solutions 
our application database performance management and recovery storage management solutions combined contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group grew from fiscal to fiscal and declined from fiscal to fiscal revenue growth in fiscal primarily related to recovery storage management and patrol products 
though this group does not include a significant proportion of mainframe products  fiscal revenues for these solutions were negatively impacted by the reduction in enterprise license transactions as discussed above 
our other software solutions contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal fiscal growth included the impact of the acquisition of new dimension and its security and output management products 
fiscal growth includes increases in revenue from our security solutions and from our acquisitions of evity in april and optisystems in august product license revenues our product license revenues consist of product license fees and license upgrade fees 
product license fees are all fees associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time 
license upgrade fees are all fees associated with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on a larger computer or computers 
license upgrade fees are primarily generated by our mainframe products and include fees associated both with current and future additional processing capacity 
our north american operations generated  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
north american license revenues increased from fiscal to and decreased from fiscal to fiscal application database performance management product license fees were the largest contributor of growth from fiscal to fiscal  followed by increased capacity based license upgrade fees 
the largest revenue decline in fiscal related to decreased capacity based license upgrade fees 
international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased from fiscal to and from fiscal to fiscal increased licensing of our application database performance management solutions was the largest contributor of growth from fiscal to fiscal  followed by capacity based license upgrade fees 
fiscal growth in application database performance management license fees was partially offset by decreases in enterprise server management license and upgrade fees 
international license revenues were decreased by due to foreign currency exchange rate changes from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal  after giving effect to our foreign currency hedging program 
maintenance and support revenues maintenance and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
maintenance and support enrollment entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems and applications 
these fees are generally charged annually and equal to of the discounted price of the product 
in addition  customers are entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for prepayment of annual maintenance fees 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any first year maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per mips basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for mainframe products 
historically  we have enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe based products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues 
to date  we have been successful in extending our traditional maintenance and support pricing model to the distributed systems market 
professional services revenues professional services revenues  representing fees from implementation  integration and education services  performed during the period  have increased over the last three fiscal years  more than doubling from fiscal to fiscal and increasing from fiscal to fiscal our professional services headcount has increased significantly throughout these years to meet the increasing demand for our expanding service offerings 
expenses percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions selling and marketing research and development cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of professional services n a general and administrative acquired research and development amortization of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles n a legal settlement n a merger related costs and compensation charges total operating expenses   selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses include personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with advertising  industry trade shows and sales seminars  and represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the cost of our professional services business is included in selling and marketing expenses as such costs were not accounted for separately that year 
personnel costs and sales commissions were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal and selling and marketing year end headcount increased from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal and from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal these increases for both years were primarily attributable to increases in our distributed systems sales representatives  technical sales support consultants and administrative support personnel 
the fiscal increase also included the addition of new dimension personnel 
sales commissions increased in fiscal as a result of the increase in license revenues and commission plan adjustments during the year 
sales commissions also increased from fiscal to fiscal even though fiscal license revenues declined 
sales commissions were impacted by sales incentives implemented in the last half of the year 
marketing costs have continued to increase to meet the requirements of marketing a greater number of increasingly complex distributed systems solutions and to support a growing indirect distribution channel 
selling and marketing expenses were further impacted in fiscal by a major re branding effort and higher levels of expenses for travel and office rent that year  and in fiscal by the costs associated with our first global users conference and increased consulting fees for implementation of a customer relationship management system 
research and development research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center 
increases in our research and development expenses for fiscal and were primarily the result of increased compensation costs associated with both software developers and development support personnel  as well as associated benefits and facilities costs 
we increased our headcount in the research and development organization from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  including the addition of new dimension personnel  and from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  including the addition of personnel from acquired companies 
research and development costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize our software development and purchased software costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
during fiscal  and  we capitalized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of software development and purchased software costs 
the growth in capitalized costs is primarily due to increases in distributed systems product development and platform compatibility efforts 
cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses consists of amortization of purchased and internally developed software  costs associated with the maintenance  enhancement and support of our products and royalty fees 
maintenance  enhancement and support costs have increased as a percentage of maintenance fees as our product revenue mix shifts to distributed systems  which require a higher level of support 
we amortized million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of capitalized software development and purchased software costs pursuant to sfas no 
in these periods  we expensed million  million and million  respectively  of capitalized software costs to accelerate the amortization of certain software products 
these software products were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues which would be necessary for us to realize the carrying value of the assets 
we expect our cost of maintenance services and product licenses will continue to increase as we capitalize a higher level of software development costs and as we build our distributed systems product support organization  which is less cost effective than our mainframe support organization because of the complexity and variability of the environments in which the products operate 
the distributed systems products operate in a high number of operating environments  including operating systems  database management systems and erp applications  and require greater ongoing platform support development activity relative to our mainframe products 
cost of professional services cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel costs associated with implementation  integration and education services that we perform for our customers  and the related infrastructure to support this business 
the cost of professional services for fiscal is included in selling and marketing expenses as such costs were not accounted for separately during that year 
the increase in these costs from fiscal to fiscal resulted from increased headcount to support the growth in professional services revenues during that period 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  facilities management and human resources 
other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services  consulting projects  insurance  costs of managing our foreign currency exposure and bad debt expense related to maintenance billings 
growth in general and administrative expenses for fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs  increased contracted services fees and higher costs associated with the infrastructure to support our growth through that year 
the expense growth in fiscal primarily related to increased personnel costs  including million of severance costs for management personnel who terminated their employment during the fourth quarter of that year 
this severance amount included cash and restricted stock expense 
fiscal expense growth also included higher bad debt expense in the fourth quarter related to maintenance billings 
fiscal year end headcount within the general and administrative organizations grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal acquired research and development in executing our product strategies  we employ both internal research and development and the acquisition of emerging technologies and  in the case of boole  bgs and new dimension  established software companies 
we believe that time to market is critical to our success in the rapidly evolving distributed systems software market  where we must compete with well established companies such as ibm  and where our products must integrate with the predominate database management systems  operating systems  network protocols and applications within the enterprise computing environment 
accordingly  we must continuously evaluate whether it is more efficient and effective to develop a given solution internally or acquire a technology that must be completed and then integrated into our existing product architecture 
the acquired technology companies are often small  early stage software companies with minimal to no revenues  quality and documentation standards and name recognition in the marketplace 
this strategy involves a high degree of risk and is costly in that a premium is typically paid for software code that is incomplete and only partially contributes to our overall development plans 
over the last several years  some of the acquired technologies were successfully completed and integrated  while others were not 
the following table presents information concerning the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for fiscal  and acquired acquired goodwill total technology ipr d and other price in millions fiscal nastel and envive fiscal new dimension fiscal evity optisystems others in april  we acquired through a public tender offer in excess of of the outstanding ordinary shares of new dimension 
total consideration paid approximated million  including the cost of the remaining of outstanding shares acquired during fiscal and the historical cost of approximately million for shares of new dimension previously owned by boole 
we allocated million to software assets  million to goodwill and other intangibles and million to equipment  receivables and other non software assets  net of liabilities assumed 
we allocated million  or of the purchase price  to in process research and development ipr d  which represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility nor had an alternative future use 
at the acquisition date  new dimension was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities in the following areas integrated operations architecture r for the enterprise  which was to be the supporting infrastructure for all of the distributed systems products from new dimension 
this project  as originally intended  was cancelled as we determined it was more appropriate to gradually extend the existing distributed systems infrastructure rather than replace it 
expansion of the output management product family to include products for distributed systems 
e business enablement  the development of the infrastructure necessary to internet ize the entire new dimension product family 
security  including additional features and add on applications for existing security applications 
enhancements to the control m r  control d r  control sa r and enterprise controlstation r products 
as of the date of the new dimension acquisition  we concluded that the in process technology had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential use of the technology in different products  the stage of development and life cycle of each project  resale of the software and internal use 
as such  the value of the purchased ipr d was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
as of march   the integrated operations architecture for the enterprise project has been cancelled  of the remaining projects  certain have been completed and the related products are generally available  others have been released as beta versions for customer testing and evaluation  and the remainder are still in process 
we intend to continue devoting effort to developing commercially viable products from the purchased ipr d  although we may not develop such commercially viable products 
all of the foregoing estimates and projections were based on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time  but which were inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of evity in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the aggregate purchase price totaled million  including cash consideration of million  million shares of common stock  million common stock options and transaction costs  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles and million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development 
net tangible assets acquired were insignificant 
the amount allocated to purchased ipr d represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows  related to evity s research and development projects not yet completed 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date  during the quarter ended june  at the acquisition date  evity was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of siteangel  an enhanced version of evity s siteangel website performance monitoring product  as well as new technologies in the areas of load testing and network infrastructure 
the projects under development at the valuation date represented next generation technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands for the web performance market 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
evity had incurred nearly million on the in process projects and expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
we completed siteangel during fiscal and project costs were materially consistent with management s estimates at the acquisition date 
also during fiscal  the remaining projects in process at the acquisition date were suspended indefinitely 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of optisystems in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the aggregate purchase price totaled million in cash  including transaction costs  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles  million to equipment  receivables and other non software assets  net of liabilities assumed  and million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development 
the amount allocated to purchased ipr d represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows  related to optisystems incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date  during the quarter ended september  at the acquisition date  optisystems was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of several components of its energizer r for r product 
the projects under development at the valuation date represent next generation technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands for the enterprise application performance market 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
optisystems had incurred approximately million on the in process projects  and expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
certain of the projects have been completed and the remainder are still in process and project costs have been materially consistent with management s estimates at the acquisition date 
we intend to continue devoting effort to developing commercially viable products from the ipr d  although we may not develop such commercially viable products 
the company completed other immaterial acquisitions during the year ended march   which were accounted for under the purchase method 
the aggregate purchase price for these transactions totaled million in cash and million in common stock options  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles and million of the aggregate purchase price to purchased in process research and development 
net tangible assets acquired were insignificant 
in making our purchase price allocations  we considered present value calculations of income  analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  assessments of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
in the present value calculations  aggregate revenues for the new dimension  evity and optisystems developed  in process and future products were estimated to grow at compounded annual growth rates of approximately  and  respectively  for the four years  five years and five years following acquisition  respectively  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major current and future research and development programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations and venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecasts and risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  discount rates of to were used to value the acquired ipr d for the various acquisitions during fiscal and fiscal specifically  discount rates of  and were used to value the acquired ipr d for new dimension  evity and optisystems  respectively 
rates of  and were used in discounting the cash flows associated with the respective developed technologies 
these discount rates were commensurate with the respective stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
if the acquired ipr d projects are not successfully completed  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in future periods 
in addition  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
we are continuously monitoring our development projects 
we believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology represent a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
the ipr d charge for fiscal also includes the write off of assets totaling million related to a technology agreement with envive corporation that was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal amortization of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles under the purchase accounting method for certain of our acquisitions  portions of the purchase prices were allocated to goodwill  workforce  customer base  software and other intangible assets 
we are amortizing these intangibles over three to five year periods  which reflect the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the increase in amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal is related to the acquisition of new dimension in april  and the increase from fiscal to fiscal is related to the evity  optisystems and other acquisitions completed during fiscal legal settlement in october  we settled all claims in a lawsuit styled bmc software  inc  plaintiff  vs

see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
merger related costs and compensation charges pursuant to the close of our merger with boole in march   management approved a formal plan of restructuring the plan which included steps to be taken to fully integrate the operations of the two companies  consolidate duplicate facilities  and eliminate redundant positions to achieve reductions in overhead expenses in future periods 
in connection with the merger and the plan  at march  we accrued approximately million in merger related costs 
this accrual included direct transaction costs  such as investment banking  legal and accounting fees  and approximately million for settlement of a suit brought against boole for allegedly breaching a standstill and exclusive negotiating agreement with platinum technology international  inc the remainder of the accrual represented management s best estimate  based on available information as of march   of identifiable and quantifiable charges we would incur as a result of the actions to be taken under the plan 
the accrued restructuring charges at march  included estimates of involuntary termination benefits for domestic employees and international employees  located primarily in europe  including the executive management of boole and various redundant administrative and support personnel 
the accrual also included charges for incremental costs to exit certain office lease arrangements  for idle facilities and for asset writedowns of office furniture and fixtures and computer hardware 
during fiscal  we made certain revisions to the plan including the following the termination of approximately additional employees  primarily in the united states and europe  the accrual of other termination benefits which were contingent upon certain performance criteria  revisions to the original exit strategy for certain operating leases for office space in the united states and europe  and the accrual of termination costs for certain operating leases for computer hardware and equipment 
additionally  in conjunction with the new dimension acquisition  we accrued estimated costs to terminate certain operating leases for duplicate office space 
the activity in the accrual for merger related costs for the year ended march   was as follows balance at paid out or balance at march  revision of charged against march  the accrual the related assets in millions direct transaction costs facility costs and write down of fixed assets to be disposed of employee termination benefits other merger related costs total accrual the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of march  during the year ended march   the company paid certain termination and facility costs and revised the estimate of remaining obligations as follows balance at balance at march  revision of march  the accrual paid out in millions facility costs employee termination benefits total accrual the remaining accrual relates to severance payments to be made in future periods 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and to a lesser degree  financed receivables and interest expense on short term borrowings 
other income  net decreased from fiscal to and increased from fiscal to the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to interest expense of million incurred on short term borrowings to fund the new dimension acquisition 
other income for fiscal includes a million one time gain related to the sale of a financial instrument and a one time million gain related to a real estate transaction 
the remaining increases in other income  net for fiscal are primarily due to decreased interest expense on short term borrowings 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded a non recurring benefit to our provision for income taxes to reflect a settlement with the internal revenue service 
during fiscal  the decreased effective income tax rate is the result of lower taxes associated with our european operations and the effect of tax exempt interest on certain investments 
the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal is primarily the result of acquisition related charges during the year that are not deductible for tax purposes 
for further discussion of the non recurring benefit in fiscal and an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
earnings per share basic earnings per share was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share was  and  respectively 
the changes in earnings per share over the three years primarily resulted from the factors discussed above 
earnings per share in fiscal were also impacted by an increase in weighted average shares outstanding  while weighted average shares outstanding remained flat from fiscal to fiscal workforce reduction subsequent to yearend subsequent to march   we reduced our workforce by approximately worldwide 
the action was across all divisions and geographies and affected employees received separation packages 
as a result of this action  we will incur a one time restructuring charge estimated to be approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

our securities are investment grade and highly liquid 
stockholders equity as of march   was billion 
we continue to primarily finance our growth through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
our primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
we provide financing on a portion of these sales transactions  to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness 
we participate in established programs with third party financing institutions that allow us to transfer a significant portion of our finance receivables on a non recourse basis for cash  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
during fiscal  we transferred million of such receivables through these programs 
the high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis without a negative cash flow impact 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  primarily related to the purchase of investment securities  construction of an expansion to our corporate headquarters  and various technology acquisitions  as previously discussed 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  which derived primarily from treasury stock purchases 
on april   the board of directors authorized us to purchase up to million in common stock 
during fiscal we purchased million shares for million 
we plan to continue to buy stock on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions 
as part of our acquisition of new dimension in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a million day credit facility with a consortium of us banks 
during fiscal  we exercised our option to convert the balance of the revolving loans outstanding under the facility into a one year million term loan with an interest rate of

the weighted average annual interest rate of all short term borrowings was 
the short term facilities include  among others  covenants regarding our maintaining at least million in cash and marketable securities and certain financial ratios 
we had no other debt as of march   other than normal trade payables  accrued liabilities and deferred tax liabilities 
subsequent to march   the term loan matured and we paid the balance outstanding 
we entered a new day million revolving credit facility  which is secured by certain of our financial assets whose market value must equal or exceed of the commitment under the facility 
interest on the borrowings under this facility is payable monthly and is accrued at a margin above libor 
we believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results our stock price is volatile 
our stock price has been and is highly volatile 
our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of future revenue and earnings growth rates 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price 
our historical financial results should not be seen as indicative of future results 
the timing and size of license contracts could cause our quarterly revenues and earnings to fluctuate 
our revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially quarter to quarter 
the timing and amount of our license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
we generally operate with little or no sales backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent upon contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
most of our sales are closed at the end of each quarter 
our business remains dependent on closing large enterprise license transactions  which can have sales cycles of up to a year or more and require approval by a customer s upper management or board of directors 
these transactions are typically difficult to manage and predict 
failure to close an expected individually significant transaction or multiple expected transactions could cause our revenues and earnings in a period to fall short of expectations 
we generally do not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expectations until the final days or day of a quarter 
we have a high degree of operating leverage 
our business model is characterized by a very high degree of operating leverage 
a substantial portion of our operating costs and expenses consists of employee and facility related costs  which are relatively fixed over the short term 
in addition  our expense levels and hiring plans are based substantially on our projections of future revenues 
if near term demand weakens in a given quarter  there would likely be a material adverse effect on operating results and a resultant drop in our stock price 
our operating margins may decline further 
there is a risk that our historically high operating margins may not be sustainable and may continue to decline  which would adversely affect our earnings 
our operating margins  excluding amortization of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles  merger related costs and compensation charges and one time charges  declined during fiscal and declined further during fiscal as compared to fiscal and prior periods 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues associated with our distributed systems products are higher than those associated with our traditional mainframe products 
since our mix of business continues to shift to distributed systems  operating margins will experience more pressure 
in addition  we are not currently profitable in our growing professional services business 
we may be unable to increase or even maintain our current level of profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
additionally  we have acquired businesses experiencing lower operating margins than us 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing  development and support personnel 
there is currently a shortage of individuals possessing the technical background necessary to sell  support and develop our products effectively 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
hiring qualified sales  marketing  administrative  research and development and customer support personnel is very competitive in our industry  particularly in some of the markets where our development teams are located  such as san jose  california  austin  texas and waltham  massachusetts 
consequently  our growth rates may be limited by our ability to attract qualified personnel 
decreasing demand for mainframe processing capacity and decreased it spending could adversely affect revenues 
fees from enterprise license transactions have historically been a fundamental component of our revenues and the primary source of mainframe license revenues 
these revenues depend on our customers planning to grow their mainframe capacity and continuing to perceive an increasing need to use our existing software products on substantially greater mainframe processing capacity in future periods 
the continued growth of distributed database management systems may have an adverse effect on growth rates for mainframe computing systems 
although we believe that businesses will continue to demand greater mainframe computing capacity and that e business will be a driver of this demand  there can be no assurance as to whether future demand for mainframe capacity will continue to grow or not 
slower growth in our customers mainframe processing capacity will adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  many industry analysts and economists are predicting slower growth and even declines in overall it spending by businesses during the next fiscal year 
any significant decline in overall it spending could adversely affect our revenues 
increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect our earnings 
the market for systems management software has been increasingly competitive for the past number of years 
we compete with a variety of software vendors including ibm and ca 
we derived over half of our total revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to enhance and market its utilities for ims and db as lower cost alternatives to the solutions provided by us and other independent software vendors 
although such utilities are currently less functional than our solutions  ibm has begun to invest more heavily in the ims and db utility market and appears to be committed to competing in these markets 
if ibm is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with our ims  db and other products at a lower cost  our business may be materially adversely affected 
ca is also competing with us in these markets 
microsoft entered the distributed systems monitoring and management market through its relationship with net iq and is now competing with us in the market for management tools for the windows operating system 
in connection with the introduction of its z series server  ibm has announced changes to its mainframe software pricing  including a new workload based pricing model 
these actions continue to increase pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
we continue to reduce the cost of our mainframe tools and utilities in response to these and other competitive pressures 
we have also announced that we will support the new workload based pricing structure for the z series  but the effect of this change on our future mainframe license revenues cannot be determined 
maintenance revenue growth could slow 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for our mainframe products 
historically  we have enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues 
to date  we have been successful in extending our traditional maintenance and support pricing model to the distributed systems market 
renewal rates for maintenance on our distributed systems products are lower than on our mainframe products 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect our earnings 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
during the past two years  funding for new ventures and start ups in our industry has been at an all time high with many new technological advancements and competing products entering the marketplace 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets 
our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of our existing distributed systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products 
we have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of our distributed systems products  and expect to have delays in the future 
delays in new mainframe or distributed systems product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that could delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
changes in pricing practices could adversely affect revenues and earnings 
we may choose in fiscal or a future fiscal year to make changes to our product packaging  pricing or licensing programs 
if made  such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings 
our customers may not accept our product strategies 
historically  we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications 
we are now integrating multiple software products and offering packaged solutions for customers systems 
there can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions 
in addition  there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions 
risks related to business combinations 
as part of our overall strategy  we have acquired or invested in  and plan to continue to acquire or invest in  complementary companies  products  and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies  the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products 
these integrations can be difficult and unpredictable  especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration 
the difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved 
successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams 
this too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits 
with each of our acquisitions  we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products of these companies 
retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement  development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
we have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees  nonetheless  we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
there can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
possibility of infringement claims 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlap 
in addition  we expect to receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods  especially in light of recent developments in the law that extend the ability to patent software and business methods 
regardless of its merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to international operations and the euro currency 
we have committed  and expect to continue to commit  substantial resources and funding to build our international service and support infrastructure 
operating costs in many countries  including many of those in which we operate  are higher than in the united states 
in order to increase international sales in fiscal and subsequent periods  we must continue to globalize our software product lines  expand existing and establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel  identify suitable locations for sales  marketing  customer service and development  and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories 
future operating results are dependent on sustained performance improvement by our international offices  particularly our european operations 
our operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
generally  our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies 
if these foreign currency exchange rates change unexpectedly  we could have significant gains or losses 
many systems and applications software vendors are experiencing difficulties internationally 
the european union s adoption of the euro single currency raises a variety of issues associated with our european operations 
although the transition will be phased in over several years  the euro became europe s single currency on january  our foreign exchange exposures to legacy sovereign currencies of the participating countries in the euro became foreign exchange exposures to the euro upon its introduction 
although we are not aware of any material adverse financial risk consequences of the change from legacy sovereign currencies to the euro  conversion may result in problems  which may have an adverse impact on our business since we may be required to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy these problems 
conditions in israel 
our incontrol and erp development operations are conducted primarily in israel and  accordingly  we are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
israel s economy has been subject to numerous destabilizing factors  including a period of rampant inflation in the early to mid s  low foreign exchange reserves  fluctuations in world commodity prices  military conflicts and civil unrest 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a state of hostility has existed  varying in degree and intensity  between israel and the palestinian people and the arab countries 
in addition  israel and companies doing business with israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by the arab countries since israel s establishment 
although israel has entered into various agreements with certain arab countries and the palestinian authority  and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the middle east  we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved 
to date  the current unrest in the region and hostilities within israel associated with the ongoing peace process have not caused disruption of our operations located in israel 
in addition  certain of our incontrol and erp employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
although our businesses located in israel have historically operated effectively under these requirements  we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on our operations in the future 
possible adverse impact of recent accounting pronouncements 
on april  and we adopted american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  respectively 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
based on our reading and interpretation of these sops  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  the american institute of certified public accountants and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
also  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize certain derivative financial instruments 
we primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to achieve hedges of firm commitments that subject us to transaction risk 
the terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of the month 
forward exchange contracts and net purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  sales transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the euro and british pound  in europe  and the japanese yen and australian dollar in the asia pacific region 
we perform comparisons  on a monthly basis  of the purchased option contracts and the forecasted sales revenues to determine hedge effectiveness 
while we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position during fiscal  or based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   and our financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect 
we used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred 
interest rate risk investments we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and investment securities approximated billion at march   and were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold 
based on our financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect 
we used a var model to measure potential market risk on our investment securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred
