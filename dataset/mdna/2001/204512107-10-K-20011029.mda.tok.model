the company s net loss of  for the year ended july   included its  loss on its investment in and advance to micro asi  inc and non cash charges of approximately  for depreciation and amortization and approximately  for employee and directors stock compensation 
in general  changes in various operating accounts result from changes in the timing and amounts of cash flows before and after the end of the period 
royalties receivable increased approximately  reflecting the company s normal cycle of royalty collections 
the approximately  increase in accrued liabilities for professional fees is principally accrued legal fees related to our enforcement actions 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we granted one company a license to a technology for one use and an option to license it for another use 
that company paid both a license issue fee and an option fee  but our agreements do not provide for another license issue fee if or when the optionee exercises the option 
we treated these agreements as a multiple element arrangement and deferred the  license issue and option fee revenue 
we expect to recognize this revenue when the optionee exercises the option and executes the second license or when the option expires

advances to e 
l 
specialists  inc through a series of bridge financing agreements  we committed to lend  to e 
l 
specialists  inc els 
as of july   we had advanced  and had reset the date for repayment to september  interest accrues on the advances at per annum on the first  and at per annum on the remainder 
however  we have recognized no interest since march  els s intellectual property secures the loan and this security interest is shared pro rata with another els lender that has advanced  to els 
our advances are convertible into els s common stock in certain circumstances  including an els financing round in excess of  on september   els defaulted on payment of the advances 
we waived this default and reset the demand date to november  based on the decline of the electronics and wireless markets  els s recent financial results and the absence of quoted values for els s stock  we validated the recoverability of our advances through a valuation of our security interest in els s intellectual property 
we considered the timing of our advances  our ability to withstand a prolonged recovery in the electronics and wireless industries and the results of the valuation of our security interest in els s intellectual property 
we expect both secured lenders to be able to recover their advances fully either through els s repayment of the advances or  if required  by taking possession of the intellectual property that secures the loan and licensing the intellectual property to recover the amount of the loan 
as of july   we classified the advances as current notes receivable based on their november  maturity 
if we determine that it would be in the best interests of ctt to restructure the financing agreement  we may extend the repayment period  increase the interest rate  and or increase the loan s conversion rate to els equity and reclassify the loan according to its repayment terms 
if we determine that we must license the intellectual property to recover the advances  we will reclassify the advances as intellectual property and amortize the balance over its useful life
