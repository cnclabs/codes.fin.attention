for the year ended december   mark to market losses were million 
the net mark to market losses for the year ended december  primarily relate to the write down of sub prime auto loans and the write down of ibc s retained interests in lease securitizations 
noninterest expenses total noninterest expenses during the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in expenses primarily resulted from decreases in personnel expense  amortization of servicing rights  amortization of goodwill  and general and administrative expenses in addition to the deconsolidation of icg 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in lawsuit settlements and real property expenses 
prior to the reduction of the company s equity interest in icg to below ownership  icg was accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary 
as such  the total expenses of icg are included in the company s results of operations in the prior year and through the nine months ended september  beginning with the deconsolidation of icg in the fourth quarter of  icg s expenses are not consolidated with the company s other operations  making some comparisons to prior periods not meaningful 
assuming icg was accounted for under the equity method  during the year ended december  total noninterest expenses decreased to million as compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in expenses primarily resulted from decreased personnel  amortization of servicing rights  legal and professional  amortization of goodwill  and general and administrative expenses 
the reductions in noninterest expenses above were partially offset by increases in lawsuit settlement costs and real property expenses 
assuming icg was accounted for under the equity method  during the year ended december   personnel expenses decreased to million as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of reduced full time equivalent employees fte and reduced bonus expense at spb and icii 
at december   the company had fte as compared to fte excluding icg at december  assuming icg was accounted for under the equity method  during the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million as compared to million in prior year 
general and administrative expenses decreased in both periods as a result of the company s efforts to cut costs and increase operational efficiency 
during the year ended december   lawsuit settlements were million as compared to  in the prior year 
lawsuit settlements increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year as a result of an agreement reached by the company with the plaintiffs to settle the securities class action litigation identified as in re southern pacific funding corporation securities litigation  lead case no 
cv ma  in the us district court for the district of oregon 
icii has paid million to the plaintiffs settlement fund and agreed to issue warrants to purchase three million shares of icii common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the warrants have a term of seven years from the date of issuance 
the common stock to be issued upon the exercise of the warrants will be registered and freely tradable and have the same rights as icii s existing common stock 
the warrants have change of control  typical anti dilution and adjustment features 
the settlement of this litigation resulted in charges totaling approximately million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   amortization of goodwill  net was million as compared to million in the prior year 
amortization of goodwill  net decreased as the company wrote off million of ibc s remaining goodwill in the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of  the company wrote off the remaining million balance of goodwill related to imperial credit lender services  inc icls  our loan documentation and signing business 
in february  we sold the assets of icls for its remaining net book value 
we do not anticipate any gain or loss from the sale of icls 
additionally  amortization of goodwill decreased as a result of the amortization of negative goodwill associated with the iccmic acquisition in the first quarter of the amortization of negative goodwill at iccmic reduced amortization of goodwill  net by million during there was no comparable amortization of negative goodwill during real property expenses began to be incurred by our company as a result of the iccmic acquisition in the first quarter of these costs solely relate to the income producing properties owned at iccmic 
real property expenses totaled million for the year ended december  there were no real property expenses incurred in non accrual loans our non accrual loans and leases increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in non accrual loans occurred primarily in the cbc and lpig portfolios 
the increase in cbc s non accrual loans and charge offs for the year ended december  was the result of prior management s asset work out strategy which resulted in lending additional funds to problem borrowers in an attempt to rehabilitate the borrower 
this strategy resulted in significant unsecured overadvances to cbc s borrowers 
additionally  cbc s customers have been negatively impacted by the economic slowdown in the technology and telecommunications industries 
all unsecured loans related to non performing credits have been charged off as of december  the increase in lpig s non accrual loans and charge offs for the year ended december  resulted from a general increase in defaults of nationally syndicated loans 
see item management s discussion and analysis asset quality  for more information about non performing assets and non accrual loans 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses was million or of total loans held for investment at december  as compared to million or at december   respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non accrual loans and leases coverage ratio increased to at december  as compared to at december  for the year ended december   the provision for loan and lease losses was million as compared to million for the same period last year 
the higher provision for loan and lease losses is primarily related to management s decision to aggressively work out or dispose of increased levels of non accrual and potential problem loans  particularly in the cbc and lpig loan portfolios 
agreements entered into with southern pacific bank s regulators as a result of a joint examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the california department of financial institutions dfi  spb entered into regulatory orders with the fdic and with the dfi 
the orders contain several requirements including but not limited to  increasing spb s capital and regulatory defined capital ratios  dividend restrictions  classified asset limitations  lending policy restrictions and procedures  and other such restrictions 
management believes the company has responded to all of the directives addressed in the orders including the recent additions of new credit and risk management personnel  the partial recapitalization of spb and the reduction of spb s classified assets 
at december   the bank was considered undercapitalized by the banking regulators 
banks so categorized are subject to certain restrictions  including prohibitions on the payment of dividends  restrictions on compensation  and increased supervisory monitoring  among other things 
other restrictions may be imposed by the regulators including requirements to raise additional capital  sell assets or sell the entire bank 
on march   the company contributed to the bank million in cash in the form of new equity capital and converted million of subordinated debt into perpetual preferred stock of the bank 
such capital infusions  in addition to bank earnings subsequent to december   restored the bank s capital to amounts above the adequately capitalized regulatory minimums cited in banking regulations 
management believes that the bank will not meet any of the required target capital ratios required by the orders during at this time  the financial impact  if any  of regulatory actions that may result from the failure of the bank to meet minimum capital requirements of the orders cannot be determined 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we have been in discussions with the fdic and the dfi with regard to our current and projected noncompliance with the regulatory orders and are in the process of completing an amended capital plan for to address our noncompliance 
see item business regulation general and note of notes to consolidated financial statements recapitalization transaction on march  we completed the issuance of million of senior secured debt 
the notes bear an interest rate of and mature on april  the issuance of the senior secured debt is the first step in a recapitalization plan first announced by our company in february subsequent to the completed senior secured debt offering  we will offer pro rata a package of the following securities in exchange the debt exchange for our three currently outstanding series of debt securities the old notes i senior secured notes due the exchange notes  ii up to million shares of our common stock  no par value and iii warrants to purchase up to an additional million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
concurrently with consummation of the debt exchange  we will issue up to million shares of common stock to the holders of a majority in interest of our old notes who executed the recapitalization agreement 
we further intend to issue and sell at least million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due to accredited investors in a private placement 
the convertible subordinated notes will be convertible into common stock of the company at per share 
the holders of old notes will be offered exchange notes as follows i the holders of our remarketed par securities due will be offered to convert into exchange notes at per dollar of face amount of such old notes  ii the holders of our senior notes due will be offered to convert into exchange notes at per dollar of face amount of such old notes  and iii the holders of our senior notes due will be offered to convert into exchange notes at per dollar of face amount of such old notes 
a majority in interest of the remarketed par securities due and our senior notes due have agreed to participate in the debt exchange  and to strip the old notes of all currently existing financial covenants 
supplemental indentures eliminating all covenants related to the old notes have been executed 
subject to the occurrence of certain conditions including the closing of the debt exchange and the issuance of convertible subordinated notes  all of the senior secured debt will be automatically exchanged into i million principal amount of exchange notes  ii  shares of common stock  and iii warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
each of the senior secured debt purchasers will further have the right during the period following the debt exchange and ending march  to elect to exchange all or a portion of their exchange notes and related shares of common stock and debt exchange warrants into million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the convertible subordinated notes will have a coupon and will be convertible into common stock at per share 
the senior secured debt holders will be entitled to receive additional amounts of exchange notes in connection with the sale of such notes by march  and for a period of days thereafter if  with respect to specified types of sales  the average trading price of the exchange notes during the day period ending on the last day of the month preceding the month in which such sale occurs is less than a price of or  for other specified types of sales  if their net proceeds from such sales  are less than of the principal amount of the exchange notes that are sold 
in any such event  each of such holders will be entitled to receive from us  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate principal amounts of such exchange notes held by such holder  additional principal amounts of exchange notes as will generate net proceeds equal to the difference  expressed as a dollar amount  between i of the aggregate principal amount of the exchange notes sold by such holder and  depending on the types of sales  either the sum of a the average trading value of such exchange notes and b the net proceeds  if any  resulting from the required concurrent actions as defined in the recapitalization agreement or the sum of x the net proceeds from such sale of exchange notes and y the net proceeds  if any  resulting from the required concurrent actions  provided  that in either event  the maximum principal amount of additional exchange notes so issuable to all such holders in the aggregate will be limited to million 
if additional exchange notes are required to be issued  million shares of common stock that would otherwise be issued to the holders of a majority interest in our old notes will be reduced by shares for each  in principal amount of additional exchange notes required to be so issued 
sales of exchange notes made above the of principal amount threshold by a holder would be taken into account in determining the amount of exchange notes  if any  issuable to such holder for sales below the threshold 
in addition  if the average trading price of the exchange notes during the day period ending march  is less than  the senior secured debt holders will be issued the maximum principal amount of additional exchange notes without being obligated to sell any of their exchange notes 
upon successful completion of the proposed offering icii will receive gross proceeds of approximately million of new capital  most of which will be invested in tier i capital of spb 
we believe that this new capital will assist our company in its attempt to increase capital levels at spb in order to meet regulatory requirements 
however  the funds raised as a result of issuing the senior secured debt and the convertible subordinated notes will not provide sufficient capital by themselves to meet the requirements of spb under its regulatory orders  and as such  we expect to raise additional capital or reduce the size of spb in order to meet the capital requirements of the regulatory orders 
furthermore  the future exercise of warrants issued in connection with the debt exchange is expected to provide approximately an additional million of capital for our company at the time of their exercise approximately three years from the date of issuance of the exchange notes 
there can be no assurance that the proposed offering can be completed or that sufficient amounts of capital combined with asset reductions can be achieved such that the bank might comply with its regulatory order requirements

other core operations oco our holding company investments and support functions  our loan documentation service operations  and the administrative and servicing operations of southern pacific bank 
we also operated other businesses in  and that we consider our non core businesses 
these are businesses that we have made the decision to de emphasize during and we group these businesses into the following categories 
equity interests franchise mortgage lending  sub prime residential mortgage banking business  and beginning in the fourth quarter of  investment banking and brokerage  
de emphasized discontinued exited businesses consumer lending  auto lending  residential mortgage lending  foreign mortgage lending businesses  and third party mortgage servicing operations 
our exit from these non core businesses has allowed our management to focus on our core business lines that have historically proven to be our most profitable businesses

coast business credit cbc s net loss for was million as compared to net income of million for the decrease in cbc s net income for was primarily attributable to an increase in the provision for loan losses  partially offset by an increase in net interest income 
cbc s net income for includes a provision for loan losses of million as compared to million for the previous year 
cbc s provision for loan losses increased sharply due to an increase in cbc s non accrual loans and charge offs for the year ended december  management believes that cbc s non accrual loans and charge offs increased due to a failed problem asset work out strategy deployed by cbc s previous management 
during the course of the previous two years  cbc s management made the decision to advance funds to problem borrowers in an attempt to rehabilitate the borrower 
this strategy resulted in significant unsecured overadvances to cbc s borrowers 
the increases in charge offs and provision for loan losses related to these credits  and the economic slowdown in the technology and telecommunications industries have been a significant cause of cbc s recent poor financial performance 
additionally  the deterioration of collateral values and the beginning of a general economic downturn in the telecommunications and technology sectors have negatively impacted cbc s loan portfolio 
we believe that cbc will continue to record relatively higher levels of provisions for loan losses due to higher levels of non performing loans and an economic downturn as long as cbc s non accrual loans remain at elevated amounts 
see item business coast business credit for a discussion of the actions taken by spb to mitigate these types of charge offs in the future

as a result of the increase in cbc s average loans outstanding  cbc s net interest income increased to million for as compared to million for the previous year

the decrease in yield was primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding balance of non accrual loans during as compared to cbc earned other income totaling million in as compared to million for the previous year 
other income for includes a million gain on sale of securities 
cbc recorded the million gain on sale of securities from the exercise of warrants in the equity securities of a borrower and the subsequent sale of its stock in the second quarter of the remaining balance of other income primarily consists of audit and other fees charged by cbc to its customers 
cbc s total expenses were million for as compared to million for the prior year 
total expenses increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased legal costs related to loan collections activity as well as to higher personnel  data processing  fdic insurance premiums  and general and administrative expenses associated with cbc s loan portfolio growth 
legal and professional fees increased million to million as compared to  and general and administrative expenses increased million to million as compared to million in and  respectively

oco s fte decreased to fte at december  as compared to fte at december  non core business lines we also operate non core businesses  which consist of businesses that we ve decided to de emphasize 
we group these businesses into the following categories 
equity interests represents our equity investments in other publicly traded companies 
effective july   we began accounting for our equity investment in fmc under the cost method of accounting 
prior to july   we accounted for our investment in fmc under the equity method of accounting 
from january  through october   we owned an equity interest of in fmc 
we changed our method of accounting for fmc since we determined that we did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over fmc  and the quarterly results of fmc were not made available to our company 
in november we sold substantially all of our shares of the bay view capital corporation bay view common stock we received in the fmc bay view merger resulting in a gain of approximately million 
this segment s source of revenue includes our common stock ownership percentage in the equity interests reported net income or loss in addition to our gains on sales of the equity interests stock  
de emphasized discontinued exited businesses represents our business units we decided to either de emphasize  discontinue  or exit 
we decided to de emphasize  discontinue or exit these business lines because they were not meeting our expectations for a variety of reasons 
these reasons included significant credit losses  insufficient loan production volumes  inadequate gross profit margins  and risks associated with international lending operations 
we include the following significant operations in exited businesses auto lending  alternative residential mortgage  and consumer loan divisions of spb  and credito imperial argentina cia  our residential loan production business in argentina 
exited businesses also includes our former mortgage banking operations  certain problem loan or securities portfolios  spb s income property servicing operations  and any loan portfolios at spb from businesses which are no longer originating new loans 
exited businesses principal sources of net revenue are interest earned on mortgage and consumer loans and mark to market valuations on loan portfolios 
exited businesses principal expenses are interest expense allocations incurred from deposits and inter company borrowings  and general and administrative expenses 
our exit from these non core businesses will allow our management to focus on our core business lines that have proven to be our most profitable businesses 
equity interests in  our equity interests included our percentage ownership of the net income of fmc  as compared to  which included fmc and southern pacific funding corporation spfc 
for  our equity interests generated net income of million as compared to a net loss of million for the significant net loss for was primarily the result of impairment charges on our equity investment in spfc 
equity interest and gain on sale of fmc during and  equity in the net loss income of fmc was  and million  respectively 
on november   the merger between fmc and bay view was completed 
we received million in cash and million shares of bay view common stock from the sale and exchange of our interest in fmc 
on november   we announced the sale of  shares of the bay view common stock we received from the fmc bay view merger 
as a result of these transactions  we received approximately million in total cash proceeds and we recorded a pre tax gain from both transactions of million 
equity interest in spfc on october   spfc petitioned for chapter bankruptcy protection under federal bankruptcy laws in the us bankruptcy court for the district of oregon 
as a result of spfc declaring chapter bankruptcy and the corresponding decline in its common stock to below one dollar per share  and subsequent de listing from the new york stock exchange  we wrote off our total investment in and loan to spfc 
during and equity in the net income of spfc was and million  respectively 
de emphasized discontinued exited businesses the exited businesses loss from operations was million for as compared to million for the exited businesses net revenue decreased for as compared to primarily as a result of a decline in net interest income  partially offset by a lower provision for loan losses 
the exited businesses incurred negative mark to market charges of million in and million in total expenses at our exited businesses decreased to million for as compared to million for the decrease in total expenses was primarily due to the closure of non core businesses 
our non core loans decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the remaining non core portfolios primarily consist of lower risk single family mortgage loans of million  franchise loans of million  and consumer loans of million 
the following table reflects the ending outstanding balances of the loans from our exited businesses loans and leases outstanding at december  exited business line in thousands auto lending division of spb   alternative residential mortgage division of spb   consumer lending division of spb   credito imperial argentina  single family loans   franchise loans   total loans and leases from exited businesses   the above table does not include net outstanding loans from the discontinued operations of amn which were million and million at december  and  respectively 
during we continued to sell loans from our exited businesses 
we sold million of auto loans  million of single family loans  million of consumer loans  and the remaining argentine mortgage loan portfolio of million  generating an aggregate net gain on sale of  additionally  we reduced our sub prime auto loan balances to million at december  as compared to million at december  at december   the remaining sub prime auto loans are carried at of the outstanding contractual balance 
during we sold  shares of impac mortgage holdings  inc imh stock resulting in a gain of  at december   we did not own any shares of imh common stock 
fte at our exited businesses decreased to fte at december  as compared to fte at december  liquidity and capital resources general we generate liquidity at our holding company from a variety of sources  including interest income from loans and investments  income tax payments received from our subsidiaries  dividends from subsidiary earnings  and sales of non core assets and investments 
an industrial bank such as spb may declare dividends only in accordance with california law and fdic regulations  which impose legal limitations on the payment of dividends 
under the regulatory orders  the bank is prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock without the prior approval of the dfi and the fdic 
because cash dividends reduce the regulatory capital of the bank  and because of the restrictions contained in the regulatory orders  it is unlikely that the bank will pay cash dividends to us on our common stock in the near future and there is no assurance that the bank will ever resume paying cash dividends to us 
the continued prohibition against the bank paying to us  unless approved in advance by the dfi and fdic  cash dividends would adversely affect our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  or to pay the interest on  our indebtedness will depend upon the ability of the bank to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to permit it to pay us dividends on our bank common stock and bank preferred stock  as well as upon on our future performance and that of the bank which  to a substantial extent  are subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
the ability of the bank to comply with the regulatory orders also will impact its operations 
management believes that  based on current levels of operations  cash flows from operations and available borrowings  and assuming that the bank is able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to pay us dividends  we will be able to fund our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future  including scheduled payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness 
our holding company s primary cash requirements include income tax payments and interest payments on outstanding debt obligations 
we also use available cash to make loans to our operating companies and investments in subsidiaries 
at december  we held million of cash and interest bearing deposits at our holding company as compared to million of cash and interest bearing deposits at december  the current amount of cash and interest bearing deposits held at our parent company is significantly less than the million of outstanding senior notes and ropes at december  the ability of our parent company to repay these obligations in accordance with their stated maturities is dependent on the cash flows generated by our parent company and other guarantor subsidiaries  in addition to future dividend payments from spb to our parent company 
spb is unable to pay dividends at the present time 
we have entered into agreements with the majority holders of our senior notes and ropes to exchange these securities for new notes under a master recapitalization plan 
see item management s discussion and analysis recapitalization transaction  for more information about the terms of the exchange offer 
the completion of the master recapitalization is expected to improve our ability to service future debt obligations along with improving the capital levels of spb 
the decrease in cash since december  was primarily attributed to investments in spb  debt repurchases  common stock repurchases and interest payments on long term debt 
on march   icii exchanged million of spb s subordinated debt and contributed million in cash in exchange for  shares of spb s series b noncumulative perpetual preferred and also made a common equity contribution of million in cash to the bank 
although such capital contributions resulted in the bank s capital ratios being above that required by statute to be considered adequately capitalized  the bank does not meet the capital ratio targets specified by the orders 
an additional approximately million would have had to be contributed to cause the bank to meet the capital ratio targets specified by the orders at march  we have an ongoing need for capital to finance our lending activities 
this need is expected to increase as the volume of our loan and lease originations and acquisitions increases 
our primary cash requirements include the funding of i loan and lease originations and acquisitions  ii points and expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of wholesale loans  iii ongoing administrative and other operating expenses  iv the costs of our warehouse credit and repurchase facilities with certain financial institutions  and v over collateralization reserve account requirements and servicing advances in connection with loans and leases pooled and sold 
we have historically financed our lending activities through warehouse lines of credit and repurchase facilities with financial institutions  equity and debt offerings in the capital markets  deposits or borrowings at spb and securitizations 
as a result of our company s recent financial performance  and based on guidance from moody s and standard and poor s ratings services  we do not believe that the capital markets are currently efficient sources of funding capital 
as such  we believe that our current sources of liquidity are limited to the deposits of spb and fhlb advances to spb 
there can be no assurance that we will regain efficient access to the capital markets in the future or that financing will be available to satisfy our operating and debt service requirements or to fund our future growth 
spb obtains the liquidity necessary to fund its investing activities through fdic insured deposits and  if necessary  through borrowings under lines of credit and from the fhlb 
at december  and  spb had maximum fhlb borrowings available equal to million and million  respectively 
these borrowings must be fully collateralized by qualifying mortgage loans and may be in the form of overnight funds or term borrowings at spb s option 
the highest balance of fhlb advances outstanding during the year ended december  was million  with an average outstanding balance of million 
the outstanding balance of fhlb advances was million at december  the fhlb advances are secured by certain real estate loans with a carrying value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
spb s deposit portfolio  which consists primarily of certificate accounts remained relatively unchanged at billion at december  and at december  spb has been able to acquire new deposits through its local marketing strategies as well as domestic money markets 
under its regulatory orders  spb may raise brokered deposits of no more than million so long as spb remains adequately capitalized as defined by banking regulations 
as of december   spb s outstanding balance of brokered deposits was million 
spb maintains liquidity in the form of cash and interest bearing deposits with financial institutions 
spb tracks on a daily basis all new loan applications by office and  based on historical closing statistics  estimates expected fundings 
cash management systems at spb allow spb to anticipate both funding and sales and adjust deposit levels and short term investments against the demands of spb s lending activities 
in addition to warehouse lines of credit and spb borrowings  we have also accessed the capital markets to fund our operations 
activity our operating activities used cash of million in the majority of this cash was used for the origination and acquisition of loans held for sale  net of sales and collections 
we generated million and million from the sale and collections of real property and trading securities  respectively  at iccmic 
other operating cash was generated by the interest income from our loan and investment portfolios after paying interest expense on our deposits  borrowings  and long term debt 
our investing activities provided million of cash in the most significant source of cash from our investing activities was a net redemption of million of short term interest bearing deposits 
we received net cash proceeds of million from the iccmic acquisition in march we also received proceeds of million from the sale of afg in june from the sale of our investment in preferred and common stock of afg 
additionally  we used million for net purchases of securities available for sale 
originations of loans held for investment  net of collections  resulted in net cash used of million 
our financing activities provided million of cash in we raised a net million in deposits at spb 
during  spb borrowed million from the fhlb and repaid million in advances 
we reduced other borrowings by million 
we used million in cash to repurchase million shares of our outstanding common stock for an average price of under a share repurchase program approved in april additionally  we also used million of cash through financing activities to repurchase million of our long term debt 
the repurchase generated an extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million  net of income taxes 
activity our operating activities produced cash of million in the majority of this cash was generated by the interest income from our loan and investment portfolios after paying interest expense on our deposits  borrowings  and long term debt 
our investing activities used million of cash in the most significant use of cash in our investing activities was a million investment of available liquidity into short term interest bearing deposits 
at december  our interest bearing deposits totaled million 
we also used cash to make net purchases of million of securities available for sale 
the most significant item of cash generation in our investing activities was from the proceeds we received on sales of stock we held in other publicly traded companies 
in  we received total proceeds from these sales of million 
these proceeds were primarily generated from the sales of our holdings in fmc and imh 
in  we received cash and million shares of bay view common stock from the sale and exchange of our interest in fmc 
on november   we announced the sale of the bay view common stock we received from the fmc bay view merger 
as a result of these transactions  we received approximately million in total cash proceeds 
also in  we sold million shares of our common stock investment in imh generating net proceeds of million 
additionally  in the second quarter of  we sold  shares of common stock investment in iccmic  generating net proceeds of million 
our financing activities used million of cash in we used million to repay deposits at spb  million to repay borrowings by spb from the fhlb  and million to repay other borrowings 
on may   we entered into an agreement with our former parent imperial bank  a subsidiary of imperial bancorp nyse imp to repurchase or million shares of our outstanding common stock for per share for a total use of cash of million 
the repurchase from imperial bank was financed through the private issuance of million of series b mandatorily redeemable cumulative preferred stock to a group of independent investors 
in november  we repurchased and retired the million of the mandatorily redeemable cumulative preferred stock 
the issuance and subsequent repurchase and retirement used a net million of cash during we also used million of cash through our financing activities to repurchase million of our long term debt 
the repurchase generated an extraordinary gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million  net of income taxes 
activity our operating activities used million of cash in the majority of this cash was used in the operations of our discontinued businesses 
our investing activities used million of cash in the most significant use of cash in our investing activities was a million net investment in loans held for investment 
the most dramatic increase in loans occurred in the portfolio of asset based and cash stream loans generated by cbc  which increased million in the most significant source of cash from our investing activities was the liquidation of interest bearing deposits of million 
our financing activities generated million of cash in the most significant source of cash from financing activities was the receipt of million in increased net deposits at spb 
our financing activities used million to repay net borrowings from the fhlb and million to repay other borrowings 
through our financing activities  we also repurchased million shares of our outstanding common stock for per share for a total use of cash of million 
imperial business credit  inc prior to ceasing lease originations  ibc primarily funded its lease originations through a permanent revolving securitization facility 
the securitization facility utilizes a trust structure and has a five year revolving period  which expires in november  and a three and one half year amortization period 
the ibc lease receivables trust trust was created pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement among ibc  as originator  ibc funding corp 
ifc  ibc s wholly owned special purpose subsidiary  as seller  and norwest bank minnesota  as trustee and back up servicer 
ibc sells its lease originations to ifc under a sale and contribution agreement ibc agreement  which simultaneously assigns its rights in the leases to the trust in exchange for trust certificates 
the class a certificates are sold to triple a one funding corp  a special purpose corporation administered by capital markets assurance corporation capmac  which issues commercial paper to fund its acquisitions 
as of december  and  there was approximately million and million  respectively  of class a certificates outstanding 
as a result of our recent credit downgrades by moody s and standard and poor s ratings services  ibc is in technical default of the terms of the trust 
as such  the insurer of the class a certificates may cause the trust to go into turbo amortization 
under turbo amortization  virtually all cash flows generated in the trust would be used to pay down the outstanding balance of the class a certificates  while the class b and c certificates  a majority of which are owned by ibc  would receive virtually no cash flows for principal and interest payments until the class a certificates are paid off in full 
ibc received a waiver of this technical default in march the waiver is renewable monthly by the insurer  at its option 
there can be no assurance given that the insurer will continue to grant the monthly waiver to ibc 
if the waiver were not to be granted  ibc s monthly cash flow would decrease by approximately million per month  and cash flow to our parent company would decrease by approximately  per month 
ifc assigned all receivables acquired pursuant to the ibc agreement to the trust 
the transactions were accounted for as sales for reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and as financings for tax purposes 
ifc assigned all its rights  title and interest in the leases  together with a security interest in the underlying leased equipment  which ownership and security interests have been perfected under the uniform commercial code 
payments of the purchase price are made directly from payments by lessees on the lease receivables 
multifamily and commercial mortgage lending during the years ended december  and  spb did not securitize ipl multifamily and commercial mortgage loans 
however  during the years ended december  and  ipl sold for cash million and million of loans  respectively 
the iccmic acquisition on march   we completed the acquisition of iccmic 
we paid iccmic s stockholders other than the  owned by icii approximately per share in cash 
the total purchase price paid by the company was approximately million 
the company s basis in shares of iccmic common stock owned prior to the merger was million 
the total cost basis of million  combined with other estimated costs of the acquisition of million bring the total purchase price to million 
in addition to the costs of acquisition  the company incurred total severance and incentive costs of million 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in the generation of negative goodwill of million 
the negative goodwill generated by the acquisition is not subject to income taxes and increased the company s tangible book value by per share at december  the company is accreting the negative goodwill into income over five years  which is expected to result in annual net income of approximately million  or per share 
at december  iccmic had total assets of million  and total liabilities of million 
inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of our company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
inflation affects the company primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
asset quality the provision for loan and lease losses for increased to million as compared to million for and million for the increase in was primarily due to increased non accrual loans and net charge offs 
net charge offs increased to million for as compared to million for and million for the increase in charge offs in primarily resulted from higher net charge offs at cbc  lpig and iwf 
net charge offs at cbc were million for as compared to million for and  for net charge offs at lpig were million in compared to million in lpig did not have any net charge offs in total non accrual loans increased to million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  total non accrual loans as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment were at december  as compared to at december  and at december  the increase in cbc s non accrual loans and charge offs at december  as compared to december  were the result of prior management s asset workout strategy which resulted in lending additional funds to problem borrowers in an attempt to rehabilitate the borrower 
this strategy resulted in significant unsecured overadvances to cbc s borrowers 
additionally  cbc s customers have been negatively impacted by the economic slowdown in the technology and telecommunications industries

in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we consider such factors as 
historical loss experience 
underlying collateral values 
evaluations made by bank regulatory authorities 
assessment of economic conditions and 
other appropriate data to identify the risks in the portfolio 
loans and leases that we believe are not collectible are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses

provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expense and credited to the allowance in amounts we believe are appropriate based upon our evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio

an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or re price within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets re pricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities re price 
in addition  a positive gap may not protect an institution with a large portfolio of arm s from increases in interest rates for extended time periods as such instruments generally have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
our arm s are predominantly tied to libor 
interest rates and the resulting cost of funds increases in a rapidly increasing rate environment could exceed the cap levels on these loan products and negatively impact net interest income 
we manage portfolio interest rate risk through the marketing and funding of adjustable rate loans  which generally re price at least semi annually and are generally indexed to prime or libor 
as a result of this strategy  at december   our total interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within one year exceeded our total interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing in the same time by million  representing a positive cumulative gap ratio of 
we closely monitor our interest rate risk as such risk relates to operational strategies 
our cumulative gap position is at a level satisfactory to management 
however  there can be no assurances that we will maintain a positive gap position or that our strategies will not result in a negative gap position in the future 
the level of the movement of interest rates  up or down  is an uncertainty and could have a negative impact on the earnings of our company 
during the first quarter of  the federal reserve lowered interest rates a total of bp from year end levels 
given our gap position at december   this decrease in rates will have a negative impact on our earnings for the year ending december  we believe that our deposit portfolio should reprice in sufficient volumes by the end of the second quarter of to absorb the majority of the negative impact of this interest rate decrease 
total rate of return swaps the company has total rate of return swap contracts for investment purposes with various counter parties  the provisions of which entitle our company to receive the total return on various commercial loans in exchange for a floating payment of one month libor plus a spread 
these contracts are off balance sheet instruments 
as of december   and  we were party to the lpig total return swap with a total notional amount outstanding of million  million and million  under which our company was obligated to pay one month libor plus a weighted average spread of

as a part of the pacifica partners i lp collateralized loan obligation clo fund launched by the company in august  the company delivered subordinate bonds of approximately million into a total rate of return swap with the canadian imperial bank of commerce cibc

at december  and  million and million was outstanding and classified as trading securities on our consolidated balance sheet 
risk management and market sensitive instruments interest rate risk is managed within a tight duration band  and credit risk is managed by maintaining diversified sector exposure within the securities and loan portfolios 
in connection with our investment and risk management objectives  we also use financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by  among other things  levels of or changes in domestic interest rates short term or long term  prepayment rates  equity markets or credit ratings spreads 
using financial modeling and other techniques  we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of investments relative to management approved investment guidelines and the business objective of the portfolios 
we operate within these investment guidelines by maintaining a mix of loans and investments that diversifies our assets 
the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
set forth below are management s projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of shareholders equity of our market sensitive financial instruments if certain assumed changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
while we believe that the assumed market rate changes are reasonably possible in the near term  actual results may differ  particularly as a result of any management actions that would be taken to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value of shareholders equity 
based on our overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk  we believe that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect the consolidated near term financial position  results of operations or cash flows of our company

assuming immediate increases of and basis points in interest rates the net hypothetical increase in net income and the value of shareholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments is estimated to be million and million after tax  or and  of total shareholders equity  respectively  at december  we believe that an interest rate shift of this magnitude represents a moderately advantageous scenario

the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term net income  cash flow and fair value was determined based on commonly used models 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors  including duration  prepayment  put options and call options 
fair value was estimated based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios 
re pricing maturity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to re pricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability

interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm s  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those reflected in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their arm s may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
average balance sheet the following tables set forth certain information relating to our company for  and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown except where noted otherwise 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
the average balance of loans receivable includes loans on which we have discontinued accruing interest 
the yields and costs include fees which are considered adjustments to yields

analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income also depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them  respectively 
rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our net interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated
