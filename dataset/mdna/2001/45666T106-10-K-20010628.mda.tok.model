revenues by region and country we provide our services throughout the world  with revenues billed and costs incurred in more than countries 
the following tables set forth our revenues by region and for major countries in terms of revenues for the years ended march   and due to the multinational nature of our client base  the table does not reflect the country in which services are provided  but rather is based on the jurisdiction in which we invoice for our services 
year ended march  dollars in thousands region americas    europe  middle east and africa emea    asia pacific    total revenues    year ended march  dollars in thousands country france    germany    netherlands    sweden    switzerland    united kingdom    united states    other countries    total revenues    distribution channels we offer our services through country representatives and through alternate sales channels such as major telecommunication service providers  value added resellers  and licensed distributors 
in the year ended march   country representatives contributed of our total revenues  while alternate sales channels contributed of our total revenues 
the table below shows the relative contribution to revenues from country representatives and alternate sales channels  as defined for financial reporting purposes 
year ended march  dollars in thousands country representatives number of representatives number of clients    country representatives revenues    percent of total revenues alternate sales channels number of sales channel partners number of sales channel partners clients   alternate sales channel revenues    percent of total revenues country representatives we currently have country representatives  consolidated and non consolidated  which together provide services in more than countries 
our consolidated country representatives are those in which we own  directly or indirectly  greater than a equity interest 
our consolidated country representatives provide services in countries and accounted for approximately million  or approximately of our total revenues  in the year ended march  our service agreements with our country representatives give us the right to recommend prices for services  set revenue targets jointly  determine staffing jointly  appoint one of the three members of the advisory review board  and terminate the agreement if the country representative fails to meet the revenue targets or if we cannot agree on revenue targets for two consecutive years 
in addition  each agreement outlines the compensation and pricing arrangements with the country representatives 
established rates and support charges are generally the same for all country representatives throughout the world 
our country representatives determine the prices they charge clients  in accordance with our recommended prices and standard discounts  and enter into contracts with clients to provide services using the world network 
we bill our country representatives and recognize the full amount of revenues for all of our services delivered to the clients 
the country representatives bill us for the sales and support services they provide  which we account for as country representative compensation 
the country representative bears the risk of collection from the client as well as the exchange rate risk 
alternate sales channels our alternate sales channels sell or take orders for all or a portion of our suite of services in their territories to clients that require one or more of our global communications services that the sales channel partners cannot supply independently 
our relationships typically are governed by multi year contracts  under which we provide services to our sales channel partners who then solicit orders for our services or resell our services to clients on terms our sales channels determine 
components of revenues our revenues are derived from providing a broad range of integrated service solutions to our multinational clients worldwide 
network services includes intranet formerly referred to as frame relay  atm  remote access  multimedia  internet and ip vpn services  
consulting  integration and provisioning services includes consulting  design  and implementation of each client s particular networking needs  our global connect services whereby we install and manage leased lines and customer premise equipment at the client s site to enable the client to access the world network and use our network services  
applications services includes e mail  messaging  collaboration  web hosting and other value added services  and 
other communications services includes x 
transport services  service access fees and other communications services 
revenues by services we currently derive a majority of our revenues from the sale of network services  specifically intranet services  remote access and ip vpn services  as shown below 
we expect that network services will continue to constitute the largest component of our revenue base going forward 
we also anticipate that a significant portion of our future revenue growth will come from network services and consulting  integration and provisioning services 
year ended march  dollars in thousands network services    consulting  integration and provisioning services    applications services    other communications services    total revenues    pricing policies the pricing for our services differs depending on the services provided  the speed of service  geographic location and capacity utilization 
in the case of services permitting dedicated client access to the network by leased circuit  pricing is generally dependent more on the nature and capacity of the service provided than on actual usage 
for example  the pricing for a connection to be used for intranet services generally consists of a monthly charge for the connection and the bandwidth access provided through the connection 
pricing for dedicated access services is therefore largely based on access equipment and bandwidth 
in the case of remote access services  actual usage and geographic location are more relevant to the pricing determination  as the client is generally charged based on the duration of each connected session 
once a base service is set  additional factors are taken into account such as charges for additional network services  breadth of the service  and discounts for larger volume clients that are prepared to guarantee specific revenue levels 
client contracts the client contracts generally include an agreed upon price schedule that details both fixed and variable prices for contracted services 
the client contracts generally have a term of one to three years  however  when clients implement a number of our services  they may choose to extend the contracts for a longer period of time 
our country representatives can easily add additional services to existing contracts  enabling clients to increase the number of locations through which they access our network  increase the speed of that access  increase the sophistication of the services they use  or extend the term for existing services 
components of costs and expenses country representative compensation country representative compensation reflects the amounts paid to the country representatives for the sales and support services our country representatives provide to clients 
these expenses are variable and increase as the revenues from country representatives increase 
in fiscal and  country representative compensation also included amounts paid to aucs for services provided under the outsourcing agreement 
bandwidth and related costs our bandwidth and related costs are primarily comprised of leasing and amortization expenses associated with the leasing or purchasing of network circuits 
traditionally  we obtained backbone capacity through short term leases 
we bear leasing expenses regardless of whether we lease directly or indirectly through another entity that may lease communications lines locally on our behalf 
as bandwidth prices began to drop and capacity became available for purchase or long term lease  we began to replace some of our short term leases on major international and regional routes with much more economical longer term solutions 
now  we have acquired a majority of our backbone network via iru or long term capitalized leases and the amortization of these assets are included as an expense 
we expect to continue to purchase such longer term capacity where it is economical to do so 
bandwidth and related costs also include related equipment  maintenance and personnel costs 
network operations our network operations expenses include costs associated with our network management  operations and support activities 
these costs include personnel  occupancy  maintenance  equipment depreciation  outsourcing costs and other network related costs 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and incentive compensation related to our consolidated country representative sales force  as well as costs related to providing centralized sales and marketing support for our non consolidated country representatives 
our selling expenses also include promotion  advertising  travel and entertainment 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other compensation  and occupancy costs for executive  financial and accounting  human resources  legal and other administrative personnel  as well as company wide management incentive related costs 
outsourcing agreement with stockholders  aucs  and its distributors on september   the company entered into agreements with three of its stockholders the stockholders and affiliates of the stockholders which  among other things  give the company access to additional multinational corporate clients of the stockholders 
our agreements with kpn  swisscom and telia have given us access to multinational corporate clients previously served by aucs and may give us access to additional multinational clients to which kpn  swisscom and telia may provide services in the future 
we obtain the aucs services provided to the multinational clients under the terms of a services agreement with aucs  which is based on our standard services agreement 
the pricing of the aucs service provides us with an agreed upon gross margin of approximately on the provision of these services 
the services agreement is terminable upon days notice by any party 
the revenues and expenses resulting from these agreements are referred to as outsourcing services revenues and expenses throughout this discussion 
we also entered into a call option for the underlying tangible assets of aucs 
until september  the option allows us to purchase any and all of the aucs tangible assets at fair market value not to exceed million 
the call right allows us to purchase the assets of aucs so that we can continue to offer the aucs services to our clients if the services agreement is terminated 
the call option may be subject to regulatory approval and is conditioned upon aucs ability to continue to fulfill its contractual obligations to third parties 
additionally  the company has entered into a three year management agreement with aucs which is cancelable by either party upon days notice 
under the terms of the management agreement  the company earns a management fee equal to of the outsourcing revenues up to a defined aggregate maximum  over the term of the agreement 
during  the company recognized management fee revenue of million related to this agreement 
also under the terms of the management agreement  the company may earn an incentive payment  based on defined financial performance criteria the performance criteria  subject to certain limits 
however  if the performance criteria are not achieved  the company will not receive the incentive payment 
in december  the company contracted with aucs to provide communications services to certain at t concert customers which were previously served by aucs 
we obtain the services provided to the at t concert customers under the terms of a services agreement with aucs which provides us with an agreed upon gross margin of approximately on the provision of these services 
compensation charges related to stock option and stock appreciation rights grants in april  we granted options to employees for the purchase of approximately million shares of our class b common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to our stock option plan 
the stock option plan was a book value plan  which converted to a market value plan upon the close of our initial public offering  creating a new measurement date for the stock options 
since the exercise price of these options was substantially below the price to the public of per share in the offering  we will record a non cash compensation charge over the five year vesting period of the options 
the amount of this charge is a function of the public offering price 
based upon the price of our class b common stock in the offering  this charge will total approximately million  of which approximately million and million was recognized in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the remaining charge will be amortized to expense at a rate of approximately million per quarter through december  during december  we issued approximately million stock appreciation rights  or sars  and during the fiscal year ended march  we issued approximately  sars to employees pursuant to our sars plan 
the sars vest per year  commencing in january  and are indexed to our class b common stock at a base price of per share 
we recorded a compensation charge in each quarter of the vesting period based upon the difference between the exercise price and market value of our class b common stock during the vesting period 
the total amount of this charge is a function of the price of our class b common stock during the vesting period 
during the fiscal year ended march   these charges were approximately million 
as of march   approximately  sars have been forfeited by employees 
during the fiscal year ended march   we amended our sars plan to provide for a tandem feature which allows for the settlement of the sars with shares of our class b common stock as an alternative to a cash settlement 
the amended sars plan provides that the sars may be settled with stock or cash at our sole discretion 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock options or award plans  we are accounting for the tandem award as equity instruments and the plan  as amended  as a fixed plan under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the amendment to the sars plan created a new measurement date 
the company credited stock related compensation by approximately million to reflect the stock price at the new measurement date 
the remaining unrecognized compensation expense of approximately million at march   will be amortized ratably over the remaining vesting period at a rate of approximately  per quarter through december  during the fiscal year ended march   these charges were approximately million 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march   and expressed in each case as a percentage of revenues

the overall increase in revenues was due to increases of million  or  in network services  million  or  in consulting  integration and provisioning services  and million  or  in other communications services 
the majority of the network services growth came from increased sales of intranet and remote access services 
intranet sales increased million  or  from million to million and remote access sales increased million  or  from million to million  over the period 
other communications services and consulting  integration and provisioning services increases included approximately million and million  respectively  in revenues from outsourcing services as revenues were earned for a full period compared to a six month period in the prior year 
excluding revenues from outsourcing services  consulting  integration and provisioning services  comprised primarily of our global connect services  increased million  or  from million to million over the period 
excluding revenues from outsourcing services  other communications services declined million  or  from million to million 
this decrease is largely due to an expected decline in our mature messaging product line and our x 
transport services  as our clients are migrating to more advanced messaging applications and non x 
based transport services  offset by a one time commitment fee paid by one of our sales channel partners of million 
revenues from our country representatives increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  excluding outsourcing services  revenues from country representatives increased million  or  from million to million over the year

while the number of our country representatives remained at over the period  revenue increases were derived through the growth of existing country representatives 
the number of our clients increased  from  clients as of march  to  clients as of march  revenues increased as clients that used mostly lower revenue generating messaging and x 
based transport services were replaced by clients that purchased higher revenue yielding network services

the balance of this expense grew in line with the related revenue 
bandwidth and related costs increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this increase was directly related to higher network leasing expenses associated with increasing the capacity of our network and our newly introduced atm capability  although the unit cost has dropped significantly 
the usage growth reflects additional client port growth and increased capacity per port  as well as the building of an infrastructure with lower capacity utilization 
lease expense  the largest component of bandwidth and related costs  increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  amortization of purchased capacity increased million  or  from million to million over the period as a result of owning a major portion of our bandwidth capacity in the backbone of our network

provision credit for income taxes increased from  in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the effective tax rate is higher in the year ended march  due to non deductible stock based compensation charges and adverse tax consequences associated with the inability to realize certain subsidiary losses as a tax benefit 
net income loss decreased from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  due to the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended march  was million compared to million in the year ended march  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income  a decrease in the growth of accounts receivable of million  and a million increase in depreciation and amortization  offset by an increase in the growth of accounts payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in cash used for investing activities during this period primarily resulted from increased purchases of property  equipment and communication lines of million and purchases of securities available for sale of million offset by increases in proceeds from sales of securities available for sale of million and maturities of securities available for sale of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million compared to million for the year ended march  our principal capital expenditure requirements involve the upgrade and expansion of the world network through the purchase or lease of transmission capacity and the purchase of network related equipment as well as computer equipment  furniture and fixtures 
we have funded these expenditures to date primarily through cash from operations  the net proceeds from our initial public offering  borrowings under our debt facilities and operating and capital leases 
our capital expenditures for the year ended march  were approximately million for network related equipment  approximately million for the purchase of transmission capacity  and approximately million for other capital expenditures 
of these capital expenditures  million were non cash transactions during the year ended march  as of march   we had capital lease commitments totaling approximately million payable in various years through and thereafter 
in connection with the deployment of our atm enabled backbone  we estimate that we will make less than million of capital expenditures during the year ending march  we expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in the year ending march  these expenditures will include payments for the purchase of additional submarine cable capacity 
we expect to use cash from operations together with the proceeds of the initial public offering and availability under the senior secured credit facility to fund these capital expenditures 
the exact amount of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including availability under our senior secured credit facility  our ability to negotiate contracts to purchase transmission capacity at favorable prices and the demands of our multinational clients 
if we have exhausted the net proceeds of the initial public offering and borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are not available  we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that any financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or that any additional debt financing would be permitted by the terms of our existing indebtedness 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay interest on  our debt obligations  and our ability to refinance any debt obligations  or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures in connection with the upgrade and expansion of the world network 
as of march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  working capital of million and total assets of billion 
indebtedness under the senior secured credit facility totaled million as of march  with additional borrowings available under this facility of million 
building mortgage indebtedness as of march  totaled million 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
over the past two years  rising prices for some of our supplies have been offset by decreasing prices for other services 
in particular  our per unit costs for leased lines and circuits has generally decreased over this period 
however  we cannot assure you that per unit costs for leased lines and circuits will continue to decline or that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which arise during the normal course of business from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
a discussion of our primary market risks associated with our foreign currency transactions  available for sale securities  and long term debt exposure is presented below 
foreign exchange risk we conduct our operations in more than countries around the world in a number of different currencies 
there is exposure to future earnings when foreign exchange rates change and certain receivables  payables and intercompany transactions are denominated in foreign currencies 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currencies through our regular operating activities and have not historically used derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risk 
we invoice substantially all sales of our services to our country representatives and sales channel partners in us dollars 
however  many of our country representatives derive their revenues and incur costs in currencies other than us dollars 
to the extent that the local currency used by the country representative fluctuates against the us dollar  the obligations of the country representative may increase or decrease significantly and lead to foreign exchange losses or gains 
we assume the exchange rate risk for our consolidated country representatives  however  our non consolidated country representatives assume the exchange rate risk under our country representative structure 
our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily arises from outsourcing services and assignment agreements with aucs  which are denominated in euros as well as operating costs associated with such agreements 
approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended march  were generated from the euro denominated aucs agreements 
the revenues and the related costs result in a net euro exposure of the gross profit  which is equal to approximately of revenues 
the euro denominated gross profit offset by other euro denominated operating costs generally results in a natural hedge 
however  timing of settlement of euro denominated accounts receivables and payables subjects the company to exchange rate risk on settlement of the receivables and payables 
euro denominated cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable related to aucs agreements were million as of march  as of march  we were primarily exposed to the following currencies the british pound  the swiss franc  and the euro 
based upon a hypothetical ten percent strengthening of the us dollar across all currencies  the potential losses in future earnings due to foreign currency exposures would have been approximately million as of that date 
as of march  we were primarily exposed to the following currencies the canadian dollar  the british pound  the dutch guilder  and the euro 
based upon a hypothetical ten percent weakening of the us dollar across all currencies  the potential losses in future earnings due to foreign currency exposures would have been approximately million as of that date 
interest rate risk we currently maintain an investment portfolio of high quality marketable securities 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable instruments including us treasury bills  obligations issued by government agencies  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  master notes  corporate notes and asset backed securities 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
all securities are classified as available for sale  and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
fluctuations in fair value attributable to changes in interest rates are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of march  are as follows carrying amount maturity fair thereafter value dollars in thousands investments cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate short term investments 
        weighted average interest rate long term debt secured bank notes        average interest rate mortgage loan         average interest rate the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of march  are as follows carrying amount maturity fair thereafter value dollars in thousands investments cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate short term investments 
      weighted average interest rate long term debt secured bank notes    average interest rate mortgage loan         average interest rate we have not historically used derivatives to hedge our interest rate risk 
however  under the terms of our senior secured credit facility entered into on august   we are required to enter into hedge agreements to provide that at least of the outstanding term loans are subject to fixed interest rates 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates and mitigate our interest rate risk 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union introduced a new currency  the euro 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations existing legacy currencies were fixed irrevocably as of december  prior to full implementation of the new currency on january   there will be a transition period during which parties may  at their discretion  use either the legacy currencies or the euro for financial transactions 
we are not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing internal systems for the euro 
while it is not possible to accurately predict the impact the euro will have on the company s business or on the economy in general  management does not anticipate that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on the company s market risk with respect to foreign exchange  its results of operations  or its financial condition 
recently adopted accounting standards during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company implemented staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab as applied to the company s operations  sab requires certain installation fee revenues to be amortized over the life of the related services rather than be recognized immediately 
deferred revenues and costs are being amortized over the average expected customer contract life of years 
the company retroactively adopted this accounting effective april   which resulted in an equal deferral of revenues and incremental and direct set up costs of million 
there was no effect on net income 
the pro forma effect of adopting sab on periods prior to april  was not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective april  the adoption of sfas no
