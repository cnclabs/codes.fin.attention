item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  excluding historical information  as well as some statements by heritage in periodic press releases and some oral statements of heritage officials during presentations about the partnership  include certain forward looking statements 
although heritage believes such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and current expectations and projections about future events  no assurance can be given that every objective will be reached 
such statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of as required by that law  heritage hereby identifies the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted by heritage in forward looking statements 
these include o changes in general economic conditions in the united states as well as changes in general economic conditions and currencies in foreign countries  o weather conditions that vary significantly from historically normal conditions  o its success in hedging its positions  o the effectiveness of risk management policies and procedures and the ability of heritage s liquids marketing counterparties to satisfy their financial commitments  o the general level of petroleum product demand  and the availability of propane supplies  o energy prices generally and specifically  the price of propane to the consumer compared to the price of alternative and competing fuels  o competition from other propane distributors and alternate fuels  o the availability and cost of capital  o changes in laws and regulations to which heritage is subject  including tax  environmental and employment regulations  o its ability to generate available cash for distributions to unitholders  o the costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings against it which may be brought against it  o its ability to sustain historical levels of internal growth  and o its ability to continue to locate and acquire other propane companies at purchase prices that are accretive to its financial results 
weather and seasonality heritage s propane distribution business is seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in its service areas 
propane sales to residential and commercial customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
sales to industrial and agricultural customers are much less weather sensitive 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher margins than sales to other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  gross profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of identical sales volumes 
heritage propane partners  lp and subsidiaries formerly peoples gas company and surviving legal entity in the series of transactions with us propane general the retail propane business is a margin based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply costs 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which heritage will have no control 
product supply contracts are one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce gross profits 
heritage generally has and predecessor heritage generally had attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
heritage has and predecessor heritage had on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities for future resale 
the retail propane business of heritage consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major fuel suppliers  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel that burns in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
since its formation in  heritage has grown primarily through acquisitions of retail propane operations and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
through august   predecessor heritage completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
predecessor heritage completed of these acquisitions since its initial public offering on june  during the period from august  and august   heritage completed additional acquisitions  for an aggregate purchase price of million  not including the merger of us propane and predecessor heritage 
on august   heritage acquired the operations of proflame  inc proflame and related propane distribution companies in california and nevada 
proflame delivered approximately million retail and wholesale gallons of propane for its fiscal year ended august  to over  customers 
proflame s propane distribution network includes customer service locations throughout california and nevada  as well as additional sites that are either railcar terminals and or storage facilities located in areas such as the san francisco bay  san joaquin valley  redding and barstow  california  and in reno and las vegas  nevada 
the general partner believes that heritage is the fourth largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on retail gallons sold 
as of november   heritage serves over  customers through approximately customer service locations in states 
the retail propane distribution business is largely seasonal due to propane s use as a heating source in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of heritage s retail propane volume and in excess of of heritage s ebitda is attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flow from operations  however  is generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
a substantial portion of heritage s propane is used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets causing the temperatures realized in heritage s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  to have a significant effect on its financial performance 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
heritage therefore uses information on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts of future operations  which assumes that normal weather will prevail in each of the regions in which it operates 
gross profit margins vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
peoples gas engaged in the sale  distribution and marketing of propane and other related products 
revenues are derived primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
peoples gas believed that prior to the series of transactions with atmos  agl  piedmont and predecessor heritage  it was among the top retail propane marketers nationally and was the largest independent propane distributor in florida 
at the time of the merger of us propane and predecessor heritage  peoples gas was serving more than  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in the florida peninsula 
in august  teco energy  inc  atmos energy corporation  piedmont natural gas company  inc and agl resources  inc 
contributed each company s propane operations  peoples gas  united cities propane gas  inc united cities  piedmont propane company piedmont  and agl propane  inc agl  respectively  to us propane  us us propane in exchange for equity interests in us propane 
the merger was accounted for as an acquisition using the purchase method of accounting with peoples gas being the accounting acquirer 
in august  us propane acquired all of the outstanding common stock of heritage holdings  inc  heritage propane partner  lp s general partner  for million 
by virtue of heritage holdings  inc s general partner and limited partner interests in heritage propane partners  lp  lp propane gained control of heritage propane partners  lp simultaneously  lp propane transferred its propane operations  consisting of its interest in four separate limited liability companies  agl propane  llc  peoples gas company  llc  united cities propane gas  llc and retail propane company  llc former piedmont operations to heritage propane partners  lp for million plus working capital 
the million was payable million in cash  million of assumed debt  and the issuance of  common units of the heritage propane partners  lp valued at million and a limited partner interest in heritage operating  lp valued at million 
an independent committee of the board of directors of heritage holdings  inc  approved the purchase price and the exchange price for the common units 
subsequent to august   additional payments of approximately million were made for working capital 
the exchange price for the common units was per unit under a formula based on the average closing price of heritage propane partners  lp s common units on the new york stock exchange for the twenty day period beginning ten days prior to the public announcement of the transaction on june  analysis of historical results of operations heritage propane partners  lp formerly peoples gas the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage propane partners  lp  formerly peoples gas  should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial and operating data and notes thereto  and the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the formation of us propane and the merger with predecessor heritage affect the comparability of the fiscal year ended august  and the eight months ended august   because the volumes and results of operations of fiscal include a full year of the volumes and results of operations of the propane operations of the combined operations and also the comparability of the results of the eight months ended august  and august   because the volumes and results of operations for the period from august  through august  also include the volumes and results of operations of agl propane  united cities  piedmont propane and predecessor heritage 
the increases in the line items discussed below are a result of these transactions 
amounts discussed below reflect of the results of m p energy partnership during the period from august  through august  and the fiscal year ended august  m p energy partnership is a general partnership in which heritage owns a interest 
because m p energy partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to heritage s net income is not significant and the minority interest of this partnership is excluded from the ebitda calculation 
fiscal year ended august  compared to the eight months ended august  volume 
total retail gallons sold in the year ended august  were million  an increase of million over the million gallons sold in the eight months ended august  predecessor heritage sold million retail gallons in the approximate month period ended august  a return to more normal weather during the peak heating season plus acquisitions were responsible for the increase 
heritage sold approximately million wholesale gallons during fiscal of which million were domestic wholesale and million were foreign wholesale 
in the eight months ended august   heritage sold million domestic wholesale gallons and million foreign wholesale gallons 
the increase in wholesale gallons is attributable to having a full year of the operations of predecessor heritage reported in fiscal  as peoples gas did not have any wholesale gallons that were reported in the eight months ended august  as a comparison  predecessor heritage sold approximately million wholesale gallons in the month period ended august  of which million were domestic wholesale and million were foreign wholesale

retail fuel cost of sales increased million or to million during the period ended august   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  foreign wholesale cost of sales also reflected an increase  going from million for the fiscal year ended august  to million for the period ended august  due to the impact of the increase in the cost of propane and increased volumes in this area 
u 
s 
wholesale cost of sales increased 
million as a result of the higher cost of fuel 
other cost of sales also increased 
million due to an increase in other revenues

the pro forma ebitda for predecessor heritage for the twelve months ended august  was million 
heritage s ebitda includes the ebitda of investees  but does not include the ebitda of the minority interest of m p energy partnership 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of heritage to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
future capital requirements of heritage are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities 
to the extent future capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities a working capital will be financed by the working capital line of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable  b growth capital  mainly for customer tanks  expended will be financed by the revolving acquisition line of credit  and c acquisition capital expenditures will be financed by the revolving acquisition line of credit  other lines of credit  long term debt  the issuance of additional common units or a combination thereof

this capital expenditure amount is reflected in the cash used in investing activities of million along with million invested for maintenance needed to sustain operations at current levels and customer tanks to support growth of operations and million on the investment in marketable securities  offset by proceeds of million from the sale of excess assets 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities of million during the fiscal year ended august   was primarily from the net proceeds of million from the issuance of million of common units in an equity offering on july  and the increase in long term debt of million  offset by million of cash distributions paid to unitholders and the general partner 
the proceeds were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the acquisition facility  substantially all of which was incurred in the acquisition of proflame  with the balance used for general partnership purposes  including additional acquisitions and repayment of debt 
on may   heritage issued an additional million series g through i of the fixed rate senior secured notes

heritage uses its cash provided by operating and financing activities to provide distributions to unitholders and to fund acquisition  maintenance and growth capital expenditures 
acquisition capital expenditures  which include expenditures related to the acquisition of retail propane operations and intangibles associated with such acquired businesses  were million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to predecessor heritage s million for the period ended august   million for fiscal year and million during fiscal in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during fiscal  million of common units and million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
in comparison  in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during the period ended august   million of common units and million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions

million of common units and million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
under the partnership agreement  heritage will distribute to its partners  days after the end of each fiscal quarter  an amount equal to all of its available cash for such quarter 
available cash generally means  with respect to any quarter of the partnership  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion that is necessary or appropriate to provide for future cash requirements 
heritage s commitment to its unitholders is to distribute the increase in its cash flow while maintaining prudent reserves for the partnership s operations 
heritage raised the quarterly distribution per unit each quarter during fiscal from the distribution paid on october  for the fourth quarter ended august   to the current level of per unit or annually for the fourth quarter ended august   the fifth consecutive increase 
the decision to increase the quarterly distribution resulted from a review of heritage s and predecessor heritage s past financial performance and current projections for available cash due to the merger between us propane and heritage 
the current distribution level includes incentive distributions payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds 
per unit annually 
the assets utilized in the propane business do not typically require lengthy manufacturing process time or complicated  high technology components 
accordingly  the partnership does not have any significant financial commitments for capital expenditures 
in addition  the partnership has not experienced any significant increases attributable to inflation in the cost of these assets or in its operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk heritage has very little cash flow exposure due to rate changes for long term debt obligations 
heritage primarily enters debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
heritages long term debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt obligations mature  heritage may refinance all or a portion of such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
commodity price risk arises from the risk of price changes in the propane inventory that heritage buys and sells 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which heritage will have no control 
in the past  price changes have generally been passed along to heritage s and predecessor heritage s customers to maintain gross margins  mitigating the commodity price risk 
in order to help ensure adequate supply sources are available to heritage during periods of high demand  heritage at times will purchase significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities and for future delivery 
heritage also attempts to minimize the effects of market price fluctuations for its propane supply by entering into certain financial contracts 
in order to manage a portion of its propane price market risk  heritage uses contracts for the forward purchase of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and derivative commodity instruments such as price swap and option contracts 
the swap instruments are a contractual agreement to exchange obligations of money between the buyer and seller of the instruments as propane volumes during the pricing period are purchased 
the swaps are tied to a fixed price bid by the buyer and a floating price determination for the seller based on certain indices at the end of the relevant trading period 
heritage enters into these swap instruments to hedge the projected propane volumes to be purchased during each of the one month periods during the projected heating season 
at august   heritage had outstanding propane hedges swap agreements for a total of million gallons of propane at a weighted average price of 
per gallon 
the fair value of the swap agreement is the amount at which they could be settled  based on estimated market prices 
at august   heritage would have had to pay approximately million to terminate the swap agreements then in place  which was recorded as accrued and other liabilities on the balance sheet through other comprehensive income 
also at august   heritage had outstanding options to purchase million gallons of propane during december and january at a weighted average price of 
per gallon 
the fair value of 
million of the option contracts was recorded as current assets on the balance sheet 
heritage continues to monitor propane prices and may enter into additional propane hedges in the future 
inherent in the portfolio from the liquids marketing activities of the partnership is certain business risks  including market risk and credit risk 
market risk is the risk that the value of the portfolio will change  either favorably or unfavorably  in response to changing market conditions 
credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers  customers  or financial counter parties to a contract 
heritage takes an active role in managing and controlling market and credit risk and has established control procedures  which are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
heritage monitors market risk through a variety of techniques  including routine reporting to senior management 
heritage attempts to minimize credit risk exposure through credit policies and periodic monitoring procedures 
liquids marketing heritage buys and sells financial instruments for its own account through its wholly owned subsidiary  heritage energy resources resources 
financial instruments utilized in connection with the liquids marketing activity are accounted for using the mark to market method 
under the mark to market method of accounting  forwards  swaps  options and storage contracts are reflected at fair value  and are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities from liquids marketing activities 
unrealized gains and losses from the financial contracts and the impact of price movements are recognized in the income statement  as other income expense 
changes in the assets and liabilities from the liquids marketing activities result primarily from changes in the market prices  newly originated transactions and the timing of settlement related to the receipt of cash for certain contracts 
resources attempts to balance its contractual portfolio in terms of notional amounts and timing of performance and delivery obligations 
however  net unbalanced positions can exist or are established based on assessment of anticipated market movements 
notional amounts and terms the notional amounts and terms of these financial instruments as of august  include fixed price payor for  barrels of propane and butane and fixed price receiver of  barrels of propane and butane 
notional amounts reflect the volume of the transactions  but do not represent the amounts exchanged by the parties to the financial instruments 
accordingly  notional amounts do not accurately measure heritage s exposure to market or credit risks 
fair value the fair value of the financial instruments related to liquids marketing activities as of august   was assets of million and liabilities of million related to propane and butane 
the unrealized loss related to liquids marketing activities for the fiscal year ended august   was and is recorded through the income statement as other expense 
the liquids marketing also had entered an option contract  which the counter party has the option to purchase million gallons of propane from october  through december  at 
per gallon 
the market prices used to value these transactions reflect management s best estimate considering various factors including closing average spot prices for the current and outer months plus a differential to consider time value and storage costs 
sensitivity analysis a theoretical change of percent in the underlying commodity value of the liquids marketing contracts would not have a significant impact in the partnership s financial position as there were approximately million gallons of net unbalanced positions at august  similarly  a theoretical change of percent in the underlying commodity values of the hedge instruments would not have a significant impact  as a change in their fair value would be equally offset by a change in value of the hedged item
