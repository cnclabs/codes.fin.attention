the company believes that funds generated from operations  its cash and marketable securities and funds available under its line of credit will be adequate to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this management s discussion are forward looking statements  the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the discussion of such matters in the forward looking statements 
due to the nature of the company s products and business  the company has been and will be involved in various legal actions arising in the course of business  some of which involve product liability and intellectual property claims 
with respect to product liability issues  the litigation and regulatory risks will continue to exist even with respect to those products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
it is possible that adverse results arising from product liability or intellectual property actions  as well as adverse results arising from regulatory or administrative proceedings  could negatively affect the company s future results of operations 
the company has been and may be in the future the subject of negative publicity  which can arise from various sources  ranging from the news media to legislative and regulatory investigations 
there can be no assurance that such negative publicity will not result in a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  its results of operations or the market price of its stock 
in addition  significant negative publicity could result in an increase in product liability claims 
the company s products  development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction  manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for medical devices 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance and approval from the fda for new products and existing products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products 
in addition  certain of the company s products that are in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre market approval pma process with the fda 
product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect the company 
the fda  various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations relating to manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
a determination that the company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of penalties  product recalls  consent decrees or product seizures 
each of the company s major business segments operates its manufacturing  warehousing and research and development activities in a single facility 
while the company has some limited protection in the form of basic insurance coverage  the company s operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected in the event of a fire or similar catastrophe 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company generally does not use derivative instruments 
the company maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents  with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
the company also has current marketable securities consisting primarily of municipal bonds and commercial paper that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years 
given the short term nature of these investments  the company is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a portion of the company s operations consists of sales activities in foreign markets 
the company manufactures its products primarily in the united states and europe and sells them outside the us through a combination of international distributors and wholly owned sales offices 
sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are in us dollars or in euros 
the sales offices invoice their customers in their local currency 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in those foreign markets 
the principal exposure on sales to third party distributors stems from the potential for weak economic conditions in the foreign market  thus weakening the foreign currency  decreasing the customer s buying power and potentially decreasing the company s sales 
the company s exposure on sales to its subsidiaries consists of the exposure related to the weakening of local currency when payment of the trade payable is made  thus translating into more local currency needed to pay off the us denominated payable than when it was recorded  lowering the subsidiaries earnings  and upon translation of the subsidiaries monthly financial statements  that a weakening local currency would cause lower market sales to be recorded in us dollars that would have occurred had the currency been stable as compared to the us dollar 
however  in the latter instance  operating expenses would also be translated at lower amounts and accordingly  the effect on net income would be mitigated 
the company does not currently hedge any of these exposures
