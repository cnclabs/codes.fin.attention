item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had million of variable rate debt at december  the interest rates on the variable rate debt are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
assuming this level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the libor interest rate would increase the company s annual interest expense by commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  the company has been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the company cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will occur in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations
