overview we provide cost effective software based communications solutions that address high speed internet connectivity requirements for existing and emerging technologies 
our communications products enable internet access through pcs and alternative internet access devices 
our soft modem products consist of a hardware chipset containing a proprietary host signal processing software architecture which allows for the utilization of the computational and processing resources of a host central processor  effectively replacing special purpose hardware required in conventional hardware based modems 
together  the combination of the chipset and software drivers are a component part within a computer which allows for telecommunications connectivity 
by replacing hardware with a software solution  our host signal processing technology lowers costs while enhancing capabilities 
from our inception in february through the end of  we were a development stage company primarily engaged in product development  product testing and the establishment of strategic relationships with customers and suppliers 
from december  to december   our total headcount increased from to we first recognized revenue on product sales in the fourth quarter of  and became profitable in  our first full year of product shipments 
revenues increased from million in to million in  million in and million in we sell soft modems to manufacturers and distributors principally in asia through our sales personnel  independent sales representatives and distributors 
our sales to manufacturers and distributors in asia were  and of our total sales for the years ended  and  respectively 
the predominance of our sales is in asia because our customers are primarily motherboard and modem manufacturers  and the majority of these manufacturers are located in asia 
in many cases  our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards that they purchase from the board manufacturers  and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers  both in the united states and internationally 
industry statistics indicate that approximately two thirds of modems manufactured in asia are sold in north america 
we recognize revenues from product sales to customers upon shipment  except sales to distributors which are recognized only when distributors have sold the product to the end user 
we provide for estimated sales returns and price rebate allowances related to sales to oems at the time of shipment 
we recognize revenues from non recurring engineering contracts as contract milestones are achieved 
revenues from technology licenses are recognized after delivery has occurred and the amount is fixed and determinable  generally based upon the contract s nonrefundable payment terms 
to the extent there are extended payment terms on these contracts  revenue is recognized as the payments become due and the cancellation privilege lapses 
to date  we have not offered post contract customer support 
customer payment terms generally range from letters of credit collectible upon shipment to open accounts payable days after shipment 
results of operations years ended december   and all amounts in tables  other than percentages  are in thousands revenues revenues    change from prior period our revenues primarily consist of product sales of soft modems to board manufacturers and distributors in asia 
revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in these increases were attributable to increased units sold to tier one oems such as compaq corporation  intel corporation  fujitsu limited and nec corporation  and to a lesser extent  increased license revenues recognized during fiscal year the increase in sales volume was partly offset by downward pressure on average selling prices and sales discounts to customers 
our average selling prices decreased from december  to december   mainly due to the downward pricing pressure which is commonly seen in the industry 
however  we believe this decrease in selling prices has generated the increase in sales volume 
revenues increased million for compared to the revenue increase was attributable to unit growth following the implementation of a new sales channel partners program and to the general acceptance of our products in the sub  pc marketplace 
the increase in sales volume was partly offset by downward pressure on average selling prices and sales discounts to customers 
our average selling prices decreased from to  mainly due to the elimination of one out of three chips in the hardware component of the micromodem product 
we believe that this hardware reduction combined with the downward pricing pressure commonly seen in the industry resulted in the decreases in the average selling price of our micromodem product 
however  we believe this decrease has generated the increase in our market share 
gross profit gross profit    percentage of revenues change from prior period cost of revenues consists primarily of chipsets we purchase from third party manufacturers and also includes amortization of intangibles related to the communications systems division csd acquisition  accrued intellectual property royalties  cost of operations  provision for inventory obsolescence and distribution costs 
gross profit increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year due to increased volume  partially offset by a decline in the per unit average gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  because of a shift to higher volume  lower margin sales to oems and  generally  average selling prices decreased faster than the rate of cost reductions 
on the other hand  higher margin license revenues favorably impacted gross margins during the year  partially offsetting the decrease from average selling prices 
gross profit increased million for compared to the increase in gross profit was the direct result of increased revenues  inventory cost reduction and economies of scale 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result of a reversal of royalty reserves of million 
excluding this reversal  gross profit would have been in upon consummation of the csd acquisition in december  we reversed million of previously recorded accrued royalties because csd had licensing agreements with payment terms more favorable than management s previous estimates of the cost of obtaining such licensing rights through our own negotiations 
additionally  we believed that future settlements with other third parties were more likely after the csd acquisition to include cross licensing of our intellectual property rather than payments of license fees or royalties  thus reducing the estimated amount of accrued royalty liability 
nonrecurring engineering and licensing revenues  which are characterized by high gross margins  were a reduced percentage of total sales in compared to this reduction adversely impacted our profit margins 
research and development research and development    percentage of revenues change from prior period research and development expenses include compensation costs for software and hardware development  prototyping  certification and pre production costs 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to as we continue to invest heavily in the development of the g 
dmt  wireless and embedded modems  as well as a v 
upgrade 
approximately of research and development expenses for the year ended december  were payroll related 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect that our research and development expenses will remain at the same level in as we continue to develop new products 
research and development expenses increased million for compared to due to the addition of personnel to develop new products related to the g 
lite  modem riser card and hidra projects as well as engineering work related to v 
modems 
hidra is one of our product names and is also an acronym for high density remote access 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses decreased in because revenue growth was proportionally greater than the increase in research and development expenses 
approximately of research and development expenses for the year ended december  were payroll related 
sales and marketing sales and marketing    percentage of revenues change from prior period sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions and marketing costs 
sales commissions payable to our distributors are recognized when our products are sold through from the distributors to end users so that the commission expense is matched with related recognition of revenues 
marketing costs include promotional goods  public relations and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase reflects the increased costs to support higher sales and the addition of sales and marketing personnel to develop new accounts and drive new product development and product launches 
public relation costs  trade shows  press tours  sales programs  the production of collateral sales materials and travel costs also increased from a year ago 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will remain at the same level in sales and marketing expenses increased million for compared to the increase reflects the addition of sales and marketing personnel to develop new accounts  support customers  and to drive new product development and product launches 
we also expanded our sales regions geographically to include japan and korea 
the production of collateral sales materials  travel costs  trade shows  sales programs and press tours also resulted in the increase in our sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  we implemented a new sales force automation system in the third quarter of to more efficiently manage our increased sales volume 
general and administrative general and administrative    percentage of revenues change from prior period general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our general management and finance functions as well as professional service charges  such as legal  tax and accounting fees 
other general expenses include rent  insurance  utilities  travel and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to other functions 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to our increase in staffing and related infrastructure to support our continued growth and the increased legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation against smart link and ess 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in as a result of the patent infringement litigation 
general and administrative expenses increased million for compared to this increase reflected additional legal costs related to an increased number of contract negotiations and patent submissions  additional tax planning  and litigation expenses related to the motorola lawsuit 
we also incurred additional expenses related to an increase in personnel 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development   percentage of revenues upon completion of the voyager acquisition on february   we immediately expensed million representing purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the million expensed as in process research and development was approximately of the purchase price and was attributed and supported by a discounted cash flow analysis that identified revenues and costs on a project by project basis 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology  based on a percentage of completion discounted cash flow method  was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established 
the following in process projects existed at voyager as of the acquisition date bluetooth  homerf  direct sequence cordless  bluetooth homerf combo  bluetooth homerf direct sequence  wireless gas tank sensor  wireless gps and wireless industrial garage door opener projects 
the value of in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate includes a risk adjusted discount rate to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
the risk adjusted discount rate applied to the projects cash flows was for existing technology and for the in process technology 
based upon assessment of each in process project s development stage  including relative difficulty of remaining development milestones  it was determined that application of a discount rate was appropriate for all acquired in process projects 
the valuation includes cash inflows from in process technology through with revenues commencing in and increasing significantly in before declining in the projected total revenue of voyager was broken down to revenue attributable to the in process technologies  existing technologies  core technology and future technology 
the revenue attributable to core technology was determined based on the extent to which the in process technologies rely on the already developed intellectual property 
the bluetooth and homerf projects were approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected timeframe for achieving these product releases was assumed to be in the second half of the direct sequence cordless project was approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected time frame for achieving this product release was assumed to be in the second half of the bluetooth homerf combo and bluetooth homerf direct sequence projects were approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected timeframe for achieving these product releases was assumed to be in the second half of and the first half of  respectively 
the wireless gas tank sensor and the wireless industrial garage door opener projects were approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected time frame for achieving these product releases was assumed to be the wireless gps was approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected time frame for achieving this product release was assumed to be in the second half of the percentage complete calculations for all projects were estimated based on research and development expenses incurred to date and management estimates of remaining development costs 
significant remaining development efforts were to be completed in the next to months in order for voyager s projects to become implemented in a commercially viable timeframe 
management s cash flow and other assumptions utilized at the time of acquisition do not materially differ from historical pricing licensing  margin  and expense levels of the voyager group prior to acquisition 
approximately million was attributed to core wireless technology and royalty revenue associated with the wireless water meter reading device project 
amortization of deferred compensation amortization of deferred compensation  percentage of revenues change from prior period  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering  we have recorded deferred compensation representing the difference between the exercise price and deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date these stock options were issued 
the amortization of deferred compensation increased  for the year ended december  compared to because reflects a full year of amortization whereas reflects amortization from the date of grant  which tended to be in the second half of we expect that the amortization of deferred compensation to remain at approximately  per quarter through the third quarter of in december  an employee and us mutually agreed to rescind an option exercise to purchase  shares of common stock which occurred in january there was no effect on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  as a result of this rescission 
the amortization of deferred compensation increased  for compared to primarily due to a higher deemed fair market value of our stock and additional stock options granted to new employees 
the amount of deferred compensation expense recorded for the grant of stock options to employees in was million  which is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options 
other income  net other income  net  percentage of revenues other income  net  consists of interest income  net of interest expense 
interest income is expected to fluctuate over time 
other income  net  increased million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to interest earned from the proceeds from the initial public offering and secondary public offering and the elimination of interest expense on the loan used to acquire communications systems division 
other income  net  decreased  for compared to primarily due to the interest expense related to the loan used to acquire communications systems division  offset by interest income generated by cash balances 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes   effective tax rate provision for income taxes decreased for the year ended december  compared to due to lower taxable income 
the effective tax rate decreased from a year ago to mainly due to an increase in our business in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
provision for income taxes increased million for compared to due to higher taxable income  while the effective tax rate remained at approximately 
we have million in deferred tax assets as of december  we believe that our effective tax rate will continue to be below the statutory tax rate of due to international sales and profits through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which are taxed at rates below the statutory tax rate in the us extraordinary items income before extraordinary item   extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt  net of income taxes of  net income   on october   we retired million of notes payable with proceeds from the initial public offering 
in connection with the early retirement of debt  we incurred a million  net of taxes  extraordinary loss for prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred debt charges 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at the end of year 
   working capital at the end of year    for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the primary source for the use of cash in operating activities for the year ended december  was due to the increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consists of the acquisition of voyager technologies and bluecom technology of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and purchases of short term investments of million  offset by maturities and sales of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock associated with the secondary public offering and proceeds from stock option exercises and shares issued through the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and working capital of million 
accounts receivable  as measured in days sales outstanding dso  was days at december  compared to days in december  collection terms on our sales to tier one customers are generally days after shipment  which is standard for our industry 
as sales to tier one customers increase  we expect dso to increase as compared to prior periods where sales to smaller customers with payment terms of days or less were proportionately greater 
however  dso at december  was abnormally low primarily due to increased cash collection efforts prior to the year end holiday period  partially offset by the increase in sales to tier one customers 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for compared to was primarily due to improved collection in accounts receivable due to the use of letters of credit and higher net income in net cash used in investing activities for reflected the purchases of short term investments  property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for consisted of proceeds from the initial public offering  offset by the repayment of the notes payable associated with the communications systems division acquisition 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our working capital and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes  and we may seek  even before that time  to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
additional financing may not be available at all  and if it is available  the financing may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us or that are not dilutive to our stockholders

fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  to the extent fin covers events occurring during the period after december  or january   but before the effective date of july   the effects of applying the interpretation will be recognized on a prospective basis from july  we adopted fin in july and this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to currency fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating all transactions in us dollars 
we may be exposed to interest rate risks  as we may use additional financing to fund additional acquisitions and fund other capital expenditures 
the interest rate that we may be able to obtain on financings will depend on market conditions at that time and may differ from the rates we have secured in the past
