overview gaiam is a multi channel lifestyle company catering to customers who value personal development  healthy living and the environment 
gaiam was incorporated in colorado in in  gaiam began to expand nationally and make acquisitions 
from to  our revenues increased from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
gaiam s business model is evolving as evidenced by the increase in the percentage of our revenues attributable to our business to business segment and the launch of our e commerce channel 
during  business to business revenues accounted for approximately of all revenues  while in  this segment s revenues increased to approximately of total revenue 
although gaiam has used acquisitions to grow its business  internal growth remained strong at during  up from in in addition  gaiam s gross margin continued to increase as a result of developing more proprietary merchandise  on which we have better margins  and negotiating better pricing from our vendors due to volume discounts 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit expenses selling and operating corporate  general and administrative total expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary  net of tax net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in gaiam s internal growth rate was  fueled primarily by the growth in sales to national retail chains and e commerce business 
business to business revenues grew to million in from million in gross profit  which consists of revenues less cost of sales primarily merchandise acquisition costs and in bound freight  increased to million in from million during as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased to in from in this was primarily attributable to the growth of gaiam s proprietary product offerings  on which we have better margins  which constituted of sales in  up from in selling and operating expenses  which consist primarily of sales and marketing costs  commissions and fulfillment expenses  increased  which is less than the revenue increase of  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  selling and operating expenses decreased to in from in corporate  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in  primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation expense and the expenses associated with a public company 
operating income  as a result of the factors described above  increased to million in from million in gaiam recorded  in other expense during  compared to other income of  in during  gaiam recognized gains on the sales of its marketable securities of million 
net interest expense declined to  in from  in  primarily as a result of interest income generated in the third and fourth quarters of minority interest net income was  in and  during income tax provision increased to million in  an effective tax rate of on pre tax income  from million in net income  as a result of the factors described above  increased to million in from million during year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in this revenue growth was primarily attributable to acquisitions 
gaiam s internal growth rate was for fiscal business to business revenues grew to million in compared to million in the commencement of e commerce sales in september resulted in million of revenues  with million recognized during the fourth quarter 
gross profit  which consists of revenues less cost of sales  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to in from in this was primarily attributable to increases in sales of proprietary or private labeled branded products  on which gaiam has better margins than other products  and continued better pricing from vendors due to increased volume 
selling and operating expenses  which consist primarily of sales and marketing costs  commissions and fulfillment expenses  increased to million in compared to million in as a percentage of revenues  selling and operating expenses increased to in from in  as a result of the increased emphasis on revenue growth  particularly in the business to business and e commerce sectors  and the sourcing  development and branding of our proprietary products

minority interest expense decreased to a negative  for compared to  in the majority of this amount represents our former minority partner s one third interest in the living arts losses  net of tax 
during  minority interest of  represented the living arts minority interest  net of tax  for the period september  through december  income tax provision grew to million in  as compared to  in the decrease in the effective tax rate to of pre tax net income for was primarily due to a one time tax benefit related to the settlement of a living arts legal judgment incurred prior to gaiam s ownership 
net income  as a result of the factors described above  increased to million for from  for quarterly and seasonal fluctuations the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in and in management s opinion  this unaudited financial information includes all adjustments  consisting solely of normal recurring accruals and adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the quarters presented 
this financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
fiscal first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands  except for per share data net revenue     gross profit     operating income loss  net income  net income per share weighted average shares outstanding     fiscal first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands  except for per share data net revenue     gross profit     operating income loss  net income net income per share weighted average shares outstanding     note the aggregate of certain of the above amounts differs from that reported for the the full fiscal year due to the effects of rounding 
quarterly fluctuations in gaiam s revenues and operating results are due to a number of factors  including the timing of new product introductions and mailings to customers  advertising  acquisitions including costs of acquisitions and expenses related to integration of acquisitions  competition  pricing of products by vendors and expenditures on our systems and infrastructure 
the impact on revenue and operating results  due to the timing and extent of these factors  can be significant 
our sales are also affected by seasonal influences 
on an aggregate basis  gaiam experiences strongest revenues and net income in the fourth quarter due to increased holiday spending 
liquidity and capital resources gaiam s capital needs arise from working capital required to fund our operations  capital expenditures related to expansions and improvements to gaiam s infrastructure  development of e commerce  and funds required in connection with the acquisitions of new businesses and gaiam s anticipated future growth 
these capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the rate of market acceptance of gaiam s product offerings  the ability to expand gaiam s customer base  the cost of ongoing upgrades to gaiam s product offerings  the level of expenditures for sales and marketing  the level of investment in distribution and other factors 
the timing and amount of these capital requirements cannot accurately be predicted 
additionally  gaiam will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  and plans to expand sales and marketing programs and conduct more aggressive brand promotions 
during the first six months of  gaiam raised million from the private placement of  shares of class a common stock and million in debentures 
the privately placed shares were sold at per share  and the convertible debentures matured on the earlier of one year after the date of the debenture or the closing date of the initial public offering 
in october  we repaid  of the convertible debentures and  simultaneous with the closing of the initial public offering  converted the remaining million in debentures to  shares of class a common stock 
gaiam s initial public offering of  shares of class a common stock at per share was completed in october giving effect to the conversion of million in debentures to  shares of common stock  the total issuance was  shares 
the offering s underwriters also exercised their overallotment option for  additional shares during november net proceeds to gaiam  after deducting all commissions and expenses associated with the offering  were million 
during  gaiam consolidated its line of credit agreements with wells fargo bank into one agreement 
the new credit agreement  which extends through january   permits borrowings of up to million based upon the collateral value of gaiam s accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by a pledge of gaiam s assets 
principal repayment of amounts borrowed under this line of credit agreement are due either when the collateral value of gaiam s accounts receivable and inventory drops below prescribed levels or upon maturity of the agreement  whichever occurs first 
borrowings under the wells fargo credit agreement bear interest at the prime rate 
the wells fargo credit agreement contains various financial covenants and also prohibits gaiam from paying dividends to shareholders 
gaiam s operating activities used net cash of million and million during and  respectively 
gaiam s net cash used in operating activities for arose primarily from increases in accounts receivable of million associated with growth in the business to business segment  increased inventories of million correlating to increased business volumes  and million to produce additional living arts video titles 
these uses were partially offset by net cash provided by operations of million 
net cash used during was primarily a result of increases in accounts receivable and inventories associated with business to business growth 
gaiam s investing activities provided net cash of million during and used cash of million during in june  gaiam sold  shares of redeemable class a preferred stock in gaiam 
com  inc at a price of  per share for an aggregate price of million 
on june   gaiam and whole foods market merged their internet businesses into gaiam 
com  inc gaiam owns of gaiam 
com  while whole foods market currently owns and the remainder is owned by various venture capital funds 
as part of this transaction  whole foods market  through its subsidiary  contributed million in cash plus other assets to gaiam 
com 
during  gaiam used approximately million primarily for the gaiam 
com website  the purchase of a acre conference resort in paulden  arizona gaiam yoga center  and additional infrastructure improvements to support the gaiam s growth 
during  gaiam generated million from the sale of marketable securities and used million primarily for its acquisitions 
gaiam also used million primarily to expand and upgrade e commerce  computer and telecommunications systems 
gaiam s financing activities provided net cash of million during  primarily from increased borrowings on the gaiam s line of credit 
during  gaiam s financing activities generated million in net cash  primarily from the initial public offering 
we believe our available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations  and borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to fund our operations on both a short term and long term basis 
however  our projected cash needs may change as a result of acquisitions  unforeseen operational difficulties or other factors 
in the normal course of our business  we investigate  evaluate and discuss acquisition  joint venture  minority investment  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the lohas industry 
in the event of any future investment  acquisition or joint venture opportunities  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that any of our financial instruments have significant risk associated with market sensitivity 
we are not exposed to financial market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are only minimally impacted by changes in interest rates 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are at a variable rate of interest  and based on the current level of borrowings  we experience only modest changes in interest expense when market interest rates change 
however  in the future  we may enter into transactions denominated in non us currencies or increase the level of our borrowings  which could increase our exposure to these market risks 
we have not used  and currently do not contemplate using  any derivative financial instruments
