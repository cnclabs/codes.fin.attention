item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe we have minimal exposure to financial market risks 
the majority of our debt is at a fixed rate 
most of the our sales transactions have been conducted in the currency where the shipment originated  limiting our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
inflation we attempt to minimize the effect of inflation on earnings by controlling operating expenses 
during the past several years  the rate of general inflation has been relatively low and has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
we purchase raw materials that are subject to cyclical changes in costs that may not reflect the rate of general inflation 
seasonality our business is mildly seasonal  with the second half of each year typically having a lower level of net sales and operating income 
this seasonality is the result of summer manufacturing shutdowns and the impact of year end holidays
