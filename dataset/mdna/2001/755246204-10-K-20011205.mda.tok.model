item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had cash and investments of million  total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
during fiscal  the company generated million in cash from operations 
the positive cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributed to income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  minority interest in the loss of the subsidiary of million 
accounts receivable decreased million during fiscal as revenues and receivables were unusually high in september 
inventories increased slightly during fiscal by million  mainly the result of inventory growth at the company s majority owned subsidiary scion photonics  inc net cash utilized in investing activities was million 
the company s business is highly capital intensive 
during fiscal  the company incurred capital expenditures of approximately million  including million of capital expenditures attributed to scion photonics  inc capital expenditures have primarily been made to upgrade or replace existing equipment in thailand  for wafer production in the united states  and to support new manufacturing processes and new technologies  including the conversion at the company s wafer facility from six inch square to six inch round wafers 
the company s plan for capital equipment purchases during fiscal is approximately million  including capital requirements for scion  which are estimated to be approximately million 
however  to the extent yields for the company s products are lower than expected  demand for such products exceeds company expectations  or the company s manufacturing process requirements change significantly  such expenditures may increase 
conversely  if demand is less than anticipated  or if the company is unable to obtain adequate financing for such capital equipment purchases  the planned capital equipment purchases may decrease 
as of september   total commitments for construction or purchase of capital equipment were approximately million 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash flows from operations  and access to the public and private debt and equity markets to fund such commitments 
net proceeds provided by financing activities during fiscal were million  the result of several transactions occurring during fiscal year the company repaid the remaining balance of million under the secured term loan and paid million in scheduled debt payments on its loans in thailand and the philippines 
proceeds from financing activities during fiscal year primarily consisted of the following transactions during the first quarter of fiscal  the company received a cash investment of million in a private placement of approximately million shares of common stock to the state of wisconsin investment board 
the company also completed a five year equipment based loan  totaling million  at a rate of libor plus with interest and principal payable monthly 
in addition  the company s subsidiary in thailand completed a million three year loan  secured by land and a corporate guarantee  with a thai financial institution 
short term borrowings  of million as of the end of the fiscal year  consisted primarily of two six month unsecured thai baht denominated loans  each at approximately million  at an interest rate of and respectively and million of convertible notes issued by scion photonics  inc and purchased by tyco ventures and integral capital partners 
the company purchased an additional million of the notes from scion 
the notes bear interest at a rate of and will be converted to equity when scion completes its second round of funding 
the company believes its current cash and cash equivalent balances  combined with its cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for at least the next months 
the restructuring efforts undertaken by the company during the last several years have significantly improved the company s ability to control expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance the company will be successful in generating the cash required to meet its long term operating requirements 
if industry and economic conditions worsen  the company does not consistently achieve timely customer qualifications on new product programs  or the company is unsuccessful at ramping up volume production on new products at acceptable yields  the company s working capital and other capital needs may increase 
conversely  if industry demand increases significantly such that the company s capital requirements exceed management s current estimates  the company may likewise need to raise additional capital 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such required financing will be available when needed on terms and conditions acceptable or favorable to the company 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its capital stock 
the company currently intends to retain any earnings for use in its business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future

gross margin the company s gross margins are primarily influenced by asps  the level of unit sales in relation to fixed costs  manufacturing yields  and product mix 
the relative impact of these factors fluctuates from time to time 
hsas typically have a lower gross margin  as a percentage of sales  than hgas 
hsas typically consist of one or more hgas and a variety of purchased components  which the company assembles into a single unit 
the cost of the purchased components comprises a significant percentage of the total cost of the hsa 
the gross margin on such purchased components is substantially lower than the gross margin on hgas produced by the company 
the combination of the respective gross margins on hgas and non hga components and associated labor and overhead included in hsas typically produce a lower aggregate gross margin  as a percentage of sales  on hsa net sales compared to hga net sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company s gross margin was of net sales during fiscal year compared to a gross margin loss of during fiscal year the improvement in gross margin during fiscal year is attributed to higher unit volumes  improved manufacturing yields and cost savings realized from the restructuring efforts initiated during the second half of fiscal year in addition  during fiscal year  the product mix was more heavily weighed to head stack assemblies  with of net sales head stack assemblies versus during fiscal year during the second quarter of fiscal  the company incurred a special charge of million relating to the obsolescence of equipment and the consolidation of the company s slider fabrication  hga and hsa prototype and development activities to thailand

without the special charge  the adjusted gross margin loss during fiscal was 
the increase in negative gross margin excluding the special charges from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of lower asps for both hga and hsa products  partially offset by higher unit sales in hgas  and a shift of product mix from hsa to hga

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate market risk the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company primarily invests in a or p or higher rated debt securities with maturities of less than two years  with no more than one third of the portfolio having a maturity greater than one year 
because of the relatively short duration to maturity  the company does not have significant interest rate exposure on its available for sale investment portfolio 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk on its fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
because of the periodic reset of the interest rate on variable rate debt  the company does not have significant interest rate exposure on this type of debt 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes on its fixed rate borrowings 
the following table summarizes the fair value for the company s interest rate sensitive instruments as of september in thousands available for sale investments   variable rate borrowings   fixed rate borrowings   a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate million adverse change in the net fair value of interest rate sensitive securities as of the end of fiscal in contrast  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million adverse change in the net fair value of interest rate sensitive securities as of the end of fiscal this potential change in fair value is based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial positions at september  and actual results may differ materially 
foreign currency market risk a substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into these transactions in other foreign currencies  primarily philippine peso  and thai baht 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  the company has established quarterly expense hedging programs using currency forward contracts 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the following table presents the notional amount  average contract rate  and the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of september in thousands september  average notional contract estimated amount rate fair value in thousands  except average contract rate foreign currency forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies philippine peso thai baht  september  average notional contract estimated amount rate fair value in thousands  except average contract rate foreign currency forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies philippine peso  thai baht  estimated fair value is equivalent to unrealized net gain loss on existing contracts
