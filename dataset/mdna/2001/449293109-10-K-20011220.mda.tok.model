item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results in operations introduction the company has two operating segments polymers processing and oilfield services 
polymers processing revenues are derived from product sales and toll services 
polymers processing product sales entail the company purchasing resin which is further processed within the company s operating facilities 
the further processing of the material may involve size reduction services and or compounding services  which include the manufacture and sale of concentrates 
after processing  the company then sells the finished products to customers 
toll services involve both size reduction and compounding services whereby these services are performed on customer owned material 
oilfield service revenues include revenues derived from exploration sales and services new tubular goods inspection  production sales and services reclamation  reconditioning and inspection of used tubular goods and sucker rods  corrosion control services coating of tubular goods and sucker rods and other sales and services transportation services and oilfield engine sales and services in canada 
service revenues in both of the company s business segments are recognized as the services are performed and  in the case of product sales  revenues are recognized when the title of the product passes to the customer  which is generally upon shipment to third parties 
cost of sales and services for the polymers processing and oilfield services segments is primarily comprised of compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  electricity and equipment costs and supplies  and  in the case of concentrate manufacturing operations and the company s distribution business  purchased raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to the sales and marketing  executive management  management information system support  accounting  legal  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs and legal and accounting professional fees 
gross profits as a percentage of revenue for product sales within the polymers processing business generally are significantly lower than those generated by the company s toll services due to the raw material component embedded in these sales revenues 
performing distribution activities inherent in product sales allows the company s processing operations to be scheduled more efficiently and enhances the company s relationships with the end users of the processed material 
demand for the company s polymers processing products and services tend to be driven by overall economic factors and  particularly  consumer spending 
the trend of applicable resin prices also impacts customer demand 
as resin prices are falling  customers tend to reduce their inventories and  therefore  reduce their need for the company s products and services 
conversely  as resin prices are rising  customers often increase their inventories and accelerate their purchases of products and services from the company 
additionally  demand for the company s polymers processing revenues tends to be seasonal  with customer demand being weakest during the company s first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season and also due to property taxes levied in the us on customers inventories on december the company s fourth fiscal quarter also tends to be softer compared to the company s second and third fiscal quarters  in terms of customer demand  due to vacation periods in the company s european markets 
the demand for the company s oilfield products and services depends upon oil and natural gas prices and the level of oil and natural gas production and exploration activity 
in addition to changes in commodity prices  exploration and production activities are affected by worldwide economic conditions  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  seasonal trends and the political stability of oil producing countries 
the oil and gas industry has been highly volatile over the past several years  due primarily to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
oil and gas prices fell sharply in the first half of fiscal  with oil prices as measured by the spot market price for west texas intermediate crude reaching a low of less than per barrel and natural gas prices as measured by the henry hub spot market price reaching a low of per mcf during the first quarter of fiscal this year low  in real dollar terms  resulted in extremely depressed levels of oilfield exploration and production activity with the us drilling rig count falling to an average of only rigs during the third quarter of fiscal the company s oilfield service revenues and income were adversely impacted by these factors 
over the course of fiscal  oil and gas prices generally increased 
during the first half of fiscal average oil and gas prices rose significantly compared to the same period in fiscal these trends have resulted in a strong recovery in demand for oilfield services generally and those services provided by the company  with the us rig count rising to an average of  during the third quarter of fiscal during the latter half of fiscal and into fiscal oil and gas prices have declined and  as a result  us and canadian rig counts have also declined 
should these trends continue  the company would anticipate the demand for the company s oilfield products and services would likewise decline 
as a result  the financial performance of the oilfield service business would also decline

the company believes ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to service debt 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all items that affect net income  such measure varies among companies and may not be comparable to ebitda as used by other companies

consolidated revenues increased slightly  up  to  due to revenue growth of the company s oilfield service business  partially offset by lower revenues generated by the polymers processing business 
polymers processing revenues declined  to  as both product sales and toll service revenues declined 
the strengthening of the us dollar relative to european and south east asian currencies negatively impacted revenues  or of the overall revenue decline 
lower volumes also contributed to lower polymers processing revenues 
the volume declines were due to competitive pressures  an ineffective marketing strategy as well as the effect of the weakening global economy  during the fiscal year 
polymers product sales revenues declined  to  much of this decline was the result of the appreciation of the us dollar relative to the relevant foreign currencies and a drop in sales volumes in the company s us market 
average sales prices also declined in the company s european market due to a decline in resin prices 
the company purchases linear low density polyethylene and low density polyethylene to manufacture most of its powdered finished products 
currently  the majority of these powdered products are manufactured in the company s europe and southeast asian facilities 
in the us  customers who require powdered products have tended to deal with the company on a toll service basis  rather than buying product manufactured by the company 
polymers toll service revenues declined  to  the decline was caused by lower processing volumes in the united states and europe and the strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal oilfield service revenues increased  to  during fiscal all major product lines experienced higher revenues during fiscal  compared to fiscal strong customer demand during the year was driven by higher oil and gas prices during the fiscal and in turn higher rig counts 
the following table summarizes important market measures which drive the company s oilfield service business 
average during fiscal year us rig count  canadian rig count us workover rig count   crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub during the last quarter of fiscal and subsequent to september   oil and gas prices declined and  as a result  rig counts have decreased 
should this trend continue  demand for the company s oilfield services will likely decline and in turn  the financial performance of this segment of the company s business will be negatively affected 
cost and expenses 
gross margins calculated as the difference between net revenues and costs of sales  divided by net revenues declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the gross margin erosion was the result of lower polymers processing gross margins  partially offset by the benefits of improved oilfield service gross margins 
polymers processing gross margins declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decline was caused by  in inventory write downs recognized during fiscal  lower processing volumes and higher workers compensation and employee medical expenses  during fiscal  compared to fiscal the company s gross margins were negatively impacted by falling resin prices in fiscal as resin prices fall  the margin the company earns on its product sales is reduced due to the timing difference between the purchase of the raw materials and the sale of the finished product 
the company expects to mitigate this risk in the future by reducing resin inventories throughout the polymers processing business 
oilfield service gross margins improved to during fiscal  compared to during fiscal the improvement is almost entirely due to the increase in volumes during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  
the increase was primarily due to cost increases during fiscal  compared to fiscal for legal fees  legal settlements  workers compensation  medical claims and oilfield service selling  general and administration expenses commensurate with the increase in oilfield service revenues 
during fiscal  the company also incurred  in proxy contest expenses related to the annual meeting of shareholders 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in fiscal  from in fiscal this increase was the result of the expense increase discussed above  as revenues increased modestly 
depreciation and amortization expenses declined to  during fiscal from  during fiscal  a decrease of 
the decline was the result of the effects of the strengthening us dollar  which had the effect of reducing reported foreign operations depreciation and amortization in us dollar terms  partially offset by the impact of capital expenditures 
fiscal charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to close three polymers processing operations and restructure another facility 
the facilities to be closed are a size reduction and compounding facility in italy  a grinding machinery manufacturing facility in the united states  and a minerals size reduction facility in the united states 
the restructured facility manufactures color concentrates in the uk 
as a result of these actions  the company recognized a charge of  which consisted of  in long lived asset impairments consisting of  in goodwill impairment and  for fixed asset impairments  of lease termination costs  of severance expenses  an inventory write down of included in cost of sales to reduce inventory values to estimated market selling prices  and of other miscellaneous charges included in the cost of services 
the amount of the fixed asset impairments were determined by comparing fair values with the corresponding carrying values of the assets evaluated 
fair value was determined as the estimated current market value of the assets evaluated based on an independent appraisal 
the facility in italy was closed due to its redundancy with the company s other  nearby italian facility performing similar services 
the machinery manufacturing facility in the united states was closed in order to integrate the operation with the company s processing facilities 
the minerals size reduction facility was closed due to its weak financial performance and was sold subsequent to the fiscal year end 
the uk operation was restructured during fiscal due to its weak performance 
during  the company recognized i a  charge for severance obligations relating to the termination of asher pacholder chairman and chief financial officer  sylvia pacholder president and chief executive officer  robin pacholder president wedco north america  david gerst senior vice president and general counsel and tom pacholder senior vice president wedco collectively referred to as the terminated pacholders  which were discussed in the company s form k filed on june   and ii a charge for litigation relating to one of the personal injury claims alleging exposure to silica  resulting in silicosis related disease 
in connection with the termination of the terminated pacholders  the company established and funded an escrow account containing  in cash 
the purpose of the escrow account is to pay federal excise tax pursuant to irs code sec 
g in the event there is a change of control  as defined by the irs regulations  within one year of the terminated pacholders termination 
due to the uncertainty surrounding whether the excise tax will be due  the  has not been reflected as an expense during fiscal year and additionally  the escrow balance has been reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets from cash on the company s september  balance sheet 
also  should a change of control  as defined  occur within one year of the severance date  a significant portion of the tax asset the company has recognized  relating to the future benefit of deducting the  severance charge  will no longer be an allowable deduction for tax purposes 
also  during fiscal  the company terminated certain polymers processing employees and recognized related severance expenses of excludes severance expenses discussed above 
operating income loss 
operating income loss declined to a loss of  in fiscal  from operating income of  in fiscal the decline was due to the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above  including the fiscal charges 
net interest expense 
net interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is mostly due to the decline in us short term interest income on cash equivalent investments and a decline in the company s cash balances during fiscal income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was during fiscal  compared to during fiscal the lower rate was due to the relation between pre tax income loss  non deductible goodwill and the mix of pre tax income or loss generated by the company s operations in various taxing jurisdictions 
the company has for tax purposes  in domestic net operating loss carry forwards nols  which expire between and  and in investment and other tax credit carry forwards which  if utilized  will result in a cash savings 
net operating loss carry forwards in the amount of  and of the tax credits are expected to expire unused 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance as of september  of relating to these tax benefits expected to expire unused 
a change in ownership under the internal revenue code has occurred  which limits the utilization of  of the company s nols and credits to approximately each year through their expiration 
net income loss 
during fiscal  the company generated a net loss of  compared to net income of  in fiscal  due to the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above 
foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the euro  swedish krona  british pound  canadian dollar  new zealand dollar  and the australian dollar have impacted the translation of revenues and expenses of the company s international operations 
the table below summarizes the impact of changing exchange rates for the above currencies between fiscal and net revenues  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization operating income pre tax income net income subsequent event 
during december  the company acquired the operating assets of rod services of canada  ltd  with a facility in red deer  alberta  canada  and trc rod services of the rockies  inc  with a facility in casper  wyoming collectively referred to as the rod companies for  in cash 
the rod companies provide rod inspection and reclamation services in western canada and the rocky mountain region in the united states 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  during fiscal  compared to fiscal the increases were due to revenue improvements in both the polymers processing and oilfield service business segments 
polymers processing revenues increased from  during fiscal to  for fiscal this increase of was the result of an increase in product sales revenues  offset in part by lower toll service revenues and the effect of the strength of the us dollar compared to the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar  and the new zealand dollar 
polymers product sales revenues increased  to  during fiscal this change was due to an increase in product sales volumes in the company s european and southeast asian markets and an increase in concentrate manufacturing volumes in large part due to the fiscal capacity expansion at the company s us concentrate manufacturing facility 
a portion of the product sales improvement in europe came at the expense of toll service revenues 
during fiscal  many european customers were converted from toll processing customers to product sales customers 
product sales revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal by the strengthening of the us dollar  relative to applicable european and southeast asian currencies 
toll service revenues declined due to lower european processing volumes  in part the result of converting some european customers to buying products rather than purely buying services  and the effect of the strengthening us dollar during fiscal the impact of these factors was partially offset by an increase in us size reduction toll service revenues 
oilfield service revenues increased  to  during fiscal compared to fiscal of this increase   is attributable to the february acquisition of milcorp increased production sales and services  corrosion control services and other sales and services 
the remaining increase is due to a strong rebound within all the company s oilfield service product lines due to increased volumes resulting from greater customer demand 
the recovery is being driven by higher oil and gas prices which rose from an average of per barrel and per mcf during fiscal to per barrel and per mcf during fiscal as a result of these higher commodity prices  the north american rig count has risen from an average of during fiscal compared to an average of during fiscal cost and expenses 
consolidated gross margins calculated as the difference between net revenues and total costs of sales and services divided by revenues  increased slightly from during fiscal to during fiscal the slight increase was caused by the effect of higher oilfield service gross margins  partially offset by lower polymers processing margins 
polymers processing gross margins were during fiscal compared to during fiscal this decline resulted primarily from a change in revenue mix 
during fiscal  compounding and distribution revenues included in product sales revenues  which generate lower gross margins than toll service revenues  became a larger percentage of overall polymers processing revenues 
this trend caused overall polymers processing gross margins to decline 
additionally  international polymers gross margins softened during fiscal  due to higher production costs which adversely affected overall polymers gross margins 
oilfield service gross margins increased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal higher volumes  due to strengthening market conditions  resulted in increased capacity utilization and  in turn  improved gross margins 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased  during fiscal compared to fiscal the decline was primarily due to lower litigation related expenses and cost controls at the corporate level  partially offset by an increase in expenses resulting from the february acquisition of milcorp in canada 
as a percentage of revenues sales  general and administrative expenses improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement was the result of revenues increasing  while sales  general and administrative expenses declined 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized severance expenses of relating to terminated employees in europe 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased from  during fiscal to  during fiscal this decline was the result of the effects of the charges relating to fixed assets and goodwill  offset  in part  by the impact of capital expenditures and the acquisition of milcorp 
fiscal charges during fiscal  the company recognized a  non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets 
of this charge relates to the oilfield services business  of which of the write down related to the impairment of goodwill and the remaining to machinery and equipment 
 of the total charge relates to the petrochemical business and reflects the impairment of four underperforming facilities 
 of the polymers charge includes the impairment of goodwill and  consists of machinery and equipment impairment 
the amount of the machinery and equipment impairments was determined by comparing fair values with the corresponding carrying values of the assets evaluated 
fair value was determined as the estimated current market value of the assets evaluated 
during fiscal  the company reduced the carrying value of property  plant and equipment primarily due to assets which were obsolete or not in working order and would not be used in the future 
of the  write down   related to the petrochemical business and related to the oilfield service segment 
during fiscal  the company recognized severance expenses of  relating to terminated employees 
of this charge  related to management changes within the company s european polymers processing operations 
the fiscal write off of start up costs of primarily relates to the closure  during the second quarter of fiscal  of an operation which had capitalized start up costs 
this operation had an immaterial impact on the company s financial results prior to the write off of capitalized start up costs 
operating income 
operating income loss increased from a loss of  during fiscal to  for fiscal the increase was due to the changes in revenues and costs and expenses discussed above 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was  during fiscal for fiscal  the company had net interest expense of  this change was primarily due to higher average debt levels partially offset by increased rates of return on cash investments 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate increased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal this tax rate increase was the result of an increase in the amount of permanent differences including the goodwill impairment charges recognized in fiscal and non deductible goodwill amortization from acquisitions  relative to book pre tax income or loss  as well as a change in the mix of pre tax income or loss generated by the company s operations in various taxing jurisdictions

capital expenditures totaled  during fiscal  of which  related to the polymers processing business  and  related to the oilfield service business 
these expenditures were made primarily to expand the company s operating capacity 
the company anticipates that available cash and or existing and future credit facilities will be sufficient to fund fiscal capital expenditure requirements 
cash used for financing activities was  during fiscal  compared to cash provided of  during fiscal the change was primarily the result of lower borrowings and lower debt repayments 
as of november   the company had approximately  of additional borrowing capacity available under various foreign credit arrangements 
currently  the company does not have a domestic credit facility 
the company anticipates that existing cash balances and the additional borrowing capacity provided under existing foreign and potentially future credit facilities will provide adequate liquidity for fiscal however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully obtain a new credit facility or that such sources of capital will be sufficient to support our capital requirements in the long term 
the terms of the senior notes indenture restrict the company s ability to pay dividends on preferred and common stock  however  the terms of the senior notes do allow for dividend payments on currently outstanding preferred stock  in accordance with the terms of the preferred stock  and up to 
per share  per annum on common stock  in the absence of any default or event of default on the senior notes 
the above limitations may not be decreased  but may be increased based upon the company s results of operations and other factors 
the company s foreign credit facilities are generally secured by assets owned by subsidiaries of the company and also carry various financial covenants 
the senior notes indenture contains a number of covenants including a limitation on the incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of stock that is redeemable or is convertible or exchangeable for debt  provided that the company may incur additional indebtedness if the consolidated interest coverage ratio  as defined in the indenture  will be at least to after such indebtedness is incurred  or if the indebtedness qualifies as permitted indebtedness under the indenture  a limitation on certain restricted payments  including  among others  the payment of any dividends  the purchase or redemption of any capital stock or the early retirement of any debt subordinate to the senior notes  subject to certain exceptions  certain limitations on creating liens on the company s assets unless the senior notes are equally and ratably secured  limitations on transactions with affiliates  a limitation against restrictions on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make certain distributions  payments or advances to the company  restrictions on the sale of assets of the company unless i the company receives the fair market value of such properties or assets  determined pursuant to the indenture  ii the company receives of the purchase price for such assets in cash or cash equivalents and iii the proceeds of such sale are applied pursuant to the indenture  a change of control provision that requires the company to repurchase all of the senior notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes upon the occurrence of a change of control change of control means i the sale  lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company and its restricted subsidiaries  ii the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the company  iii any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than of the total voting power of the voting stock of the company or iv a majority of the members of the board of directors no longer being continuing directors where continuing directors means the members of the board of directors on the date of the indenture and members that were nominated for election or elected to the board of directors with the affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the board at the time of such nomination or election  a limitation of certain sale leaseback transactions  and restrictions on guarantees of certain indebtedness by the company s restricted subsidiaries 
the indenture also restricts certain mergers  consolidations or dispositions of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
conversion to the euro currency the company has a substantial portion of its operations within countries that adopted the euro currency on january  the company now invoices and receives payments denominated in euros whenever possible 
the cost of achieving this has not been material 
the adoption of the euro by the european economic and monetary union is ultimately expected  from a competitive viewpoint  to benefit the company to some extent as price transparency becomes a reality 
the company continues to believe that the impact of adopting the euro with regard to currency exchange and taxation implications will not have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial condition of the company

the significant indebtedness incurred in june  as a result of the placement of the senior notes due in  has several important implications for the company  including  but not limited to  the following i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to service the company s indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be restricted  iii the company s flexibility to expand  make capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be impaired future acquisitions may require the company to alter its capitalization significantly  which changes may significantly alter the leverage of the company  iv the indenture relating to the senior notes contains  and future agreements relating to the company s indebtedness may contain  certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  limitations on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens and other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  to sell or otherwise dispose of assets or to merge or consolidate with another entity failure to comply with these provisions may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company  and v the ability of the company to satisfy its obligations pursuant to such indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and management  financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the business and operations of the company  some of which are not in the company s control 
to the extent that the company is unable to repay the principal amount of the notes out of cash on hand  it may i seek to repay the notes with the proceeds of an equity offering  ii seek refinancing  or iii sell significant assets 
there can be no assurance that any of the forgoing alternatives will be available to the company at all or on terms that are favorable to the company 
if the company cannot satisfy its obligations related to such indebtedness  substantially all of the company s long term debt could be in default and could be declared immediately due and payable which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates through its oilfield service business has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s oilfield services depends principally upon the level of domestic oil and gas drilling and workover activity  which  in turn  depends upon factors such as the level of oil and gas prices  expectations about future oil and gas prices  the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  worldwide weather conditions  international political  military  regulatory and economic conditions and the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital 
oil prices and  to a lesser extent  gas prices declined significantly during  which resulted in decreases in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
oil and gas prices rebounded during and the first half of  and this improvement resulted in an increase in demand for the company s oilfield services 
during the latter half of and into early fiscal  oil and gas prices have softened 
no assurance can be given that current market conditions will not continue to deteriorate and  therefore  whether or not the demand for the company s oilfield services will decline in the future 
industry conditions will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company will have no control 
a further decline in oil or gas prices or domestic oilfield activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s oilfield service business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  the oilfield service business is substantially seasonal  reflecting the pattern of oilfield drilling and workovers  with the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal years having generally higher levels of activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the business cycles of the company s polymers processing services segment are affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the various regions in which the company operates and changes in the cost of the polymers ie resins produced by the major chemical companies 
these costs are outside of the company s control and the business cycles are generally volatile and relatively unpredictable 
in addition  such business cycles may reflect cycles in the petroleum industry and oil and gas price changes  which affect both of the company s business segments and may make the company  as a whole  vulnerable to the effect of changes in the petroleum industry 
the operations of the company s oilfield service and polymers processing businesses are dependent to a certain degree upon proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets either developed by the company or licensed to it by third parties 
in many cases  these or equivalent processes or technologies are available to the company s competitors  customers and others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such persons will not develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary processes and technologies 
the availability to  or development by others of equivalent or superior information  processes or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
over the past several years  the company has made many acquisitions  and management expects that other businesses will be acquired in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates and their owners  or that the company will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company at all  or without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
there can be no assurance that businesses acquired will achieve sales and profitability that justify the investment made by the company 
any inability on the part of the company to control these risks effectively and integrate and manage acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may  to the extent allowed by agreements  incur indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing or that  if available  such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased interest expense  increased financial leverage or decreased operating income  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company entered the specialty polymers processing industry with its acquisition of wedco in april  and had no experience in the industry prior to the acquisition 
since the acquisition of wedco  the company has expanded its specialty polymers processing operations by making numerous business acquisitions 
the success of the company will depend  in part  on the company s ability to continue the integration of acquired specialty chemical operations by  among other things  centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and developing programs and processes that will promote cooperation among the businesses and the sharing of resources 
in addition  the growth of the company has and will continue to place significant demands on the company s management  internal systems and networks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage or implement its plans for these operations or that  if implemented  such plans will be successful 
in addition  in fiscal year  the company began to expand the distribution aspects of its specialty polymers production services business through acquisitions of the existing businesses and the execution of supply agreements with certain resin suppliers 
these distribution operations  as well as the concentrate manufacturing operations  require the company to buy and manage inventories of supplies and products and  in turn  to maintain greater levels of working capital than it has historically and to manage the risk of ownership of commodity inventories having fluctuating market values 
the maintenance of excessive inventories in these businesses could expose the company to losses from drops in market prices for its products while maintenance of insufficient inventories may result in lost sales to the company 
a portion of the company s current operations is conducted in international markets  particularly the company s european and southeast asian specialty polymers processing services business 
the company expects to continue to seek to expand its international operations  both in the company s polymers processing and oilfield services businesses  primarily through internal growth and acquisitions 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties normally associated with international operations  including among others  risks of government policies regarding private property  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations and other restrictions arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the company conducts business that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights  and  possibly  civil disturbance or other forms of conflict 
losses from the factors above could be material in those countries where the company now has or may in the future have a concentration of assets 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include equipment or product failures or work related accidents which could also result in personal injury  property damages  pollution and other environmental risks 
the company may not be fully insured against possible losses pursuant to such risks 
such losses could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  from time to time  the company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of its business and is currently involved in numerous legal proceedings in connection with its operations and those of its acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur substantial liability as a result of these or other proceedings 
the company is subject to numerous and changing local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning the use  storage  treatment  disposal and general handling of hazardous materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes  and restricting releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain and maintain certain permits and other authorizations mandating procedures under which the company will operate and restricting emissions 
many of these laws and regulations provide for strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting from releases of regulated materials into the environment 
violations of mandatory procedures under operating permits may result in fines  remedial actions or  in more serious instances  shutdowns or revocation of permits or authorizations
