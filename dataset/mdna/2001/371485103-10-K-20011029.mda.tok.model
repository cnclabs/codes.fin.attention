item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general corporate history 
we were incorporated in delaware in september for the purpose of acquiring generex pharmaceuticals  inc  a canadian corporation formed in november to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and other activities 
our acquisition of generex pharmaceuticals was completed in october in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock 
in january  we participated in a reverse acquisition with green mt 
p 
s  inc  a previously inactive idaho corporation formed in as a result of this transaction  our shareholders the former shareholders of generex pharmaceuticals acquired a majority approximately of the outstanding capital stock of green mt  we became a wholly owned subsidiary of green mt  green mt 
changed its corporate name to generex biotechnology corporation generex idaho  and we changed our corporate name to gbc delaware  inc because the reverse acquisition resulted in our shareholders becoming the majority holders of generex idaho  we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes 
thus  our historical financial statements  which essentially represented the historical financial statements of generex pharmaceuticals  were deemed to be the historical financial statements of generex idaho 
in april  we completed a reorganization in which we merged with generex idaho 
in this transaction  all outstanding shares of generex idaho were converted into our shares  generex idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity  and we changed our corporate name back to generex biotechnology corporation 
this reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting 
business history 
we are engaged in the development of proprietary drug delivery technology 
our principal business focus has been to develop a technology for buccal delivery absorption through the inner cheek walls of large molecule drugs  ie  drugs composed of molecules with molecular weights above a specified level 
large molecule drugs historically have been administered only by injection because their size inhibits or precludes absorption if administered by oral  transdermal  transnasal or other means 
our first product is an insulin formulation that is administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using a hand held aerosol spray applicator 
between january and september  we conducted clinical trials on this product in the united states  canada and europe 
in september  we entered into an agreement to develop this product with eli lilly and company 
under this agreement  lilly is responsible for conducting clinical trials of the product  securing regulatory approvals and marketing on a worldwide basis 
lilly also has the option to develop certain additional products using our buccal delivery technology depending on the success of the initial product 
we received  in connection with our entry into the agreement and will receive certain other initial fees and milestone payments subject to the attainment of certain product development milestones  as well as royalty payments based on product sales should any products be approved for commercial sale 
lilly also has the option to develop certain additional products using our buccal delivery technology depending on the success of the initial product 
in january  we established a joint venture with elan international services  ltd 
eis  a wholly owed subsidiary of elan corporation  plc eis and elan corporation  plc being collectively referred to as elan 
the joint venture will pursue the application of certain of our and elan s drug delivery technologies  including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products  for the treatment of prostate cancer  endometriosis and or the suppression of testosterone and estrogen 
the parties intend to select at least one pharmaceutical product for research and development under the joint venture within one year s time 
the parties will conduct the joint venture through generex bermuda  ltd  a bermuda limited liability company 
in connection with the joint venture  eis purchased  shares of a new series of our preferred stock  designated as series a preferred stock  for  we applied the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock to subscribe for an equity ownership interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
eis paid in capital of  to subscribe for a equity interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
while we initially own of the joint venture entity  eis has the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase its ownership up to by exchanging the series a preferred stock for of our interest in the joint venture entity 
generex bermuda  ltd 
was granted non exclusive licenses to utilize our buccal delivery technology and certain elan drug delivery technologies 
using the funds from its initial capitalization  generex bermuda  ltd 
paid a non refundable license fee of  to elan in consideration for being granted the rights to utilize the elan drug delivery technologies 
eis also purchased  shares of our common stock for  we may use the proceeds of this sale for any corporate purpose 
if the joint venture achieves certain milestones  we may require eis to purchase an additional  of our common stock at a premium to the then prevailing fair market value of our common stock 
our buccal delivery technology is a platform technology that we believe has application to a significant number of large molecule drugs in addition to insulin 
in the future  we expect to undertake development of additional products based on this technology that are not covered by our agreement with lilly 
we do not expect to receive any revenues from product sales in the current fiscal year 
we received a  signing fee  which is included in revenues as all necessary requirements have been satisfied  under the terms of the agreement with lilly in the first fiscal quarter of fy we expect  however  to satisfy a substantial majority of our cash needs during the current year from capital raised through prior equity financing 
results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  in the year ended july  fy compared to a loss of  in the year ended july  fy 
the increase in our fy net loss resulted from increases in research and development expenses to  from  and in general and administrative expenses to  from 
our interest and miscellaneous income in fy increased to  from  in fy the accounting treatment of the minority shareholder s share of the loss generated by generex bermuda  ltd  resulted in a  minority interest share of loss 
in addition  we received  in revenues in connection with the agreement with lilly 
the principal reasons for the increase in our research and development expense in fy were o the accounting treatment for our joint venture with elan  which resulted in a  research and development expense for the license fee paid by generex bermuda ltd 
to elan for technology rights the company s consolidated net loss  which includes this expense  however  was partially offset by approximately million of minority interest  reflecting elan s ownership interest in the joint venture  and o increased expenditures relating to clinical studies of our oral insulin formulation 
the principal reasons for the increase in our general and administrative expenses in fy were o expenses incurred in connection with the termination in august of the equity line facility  pursuant to which the company paid  to tradersbloom limited   to ladenburg thalman co  and expensed the deferred financing costs the fair value of the warrants  approximately  all of which were included in fy  o increased travel and other costs of  to  from  associated with attendance at and sponsorship of industry seminars and exhibitions and other promotional activities  o an increase of  in legal and accounting fees and expenses to  from  related primarily to legal and accounting services in connection with reporting requirements under the securities and exchange act of  litigation defense costs and increased legal activity necessitated by increased equity financing and business activity  o increased personnel costs of  to  from  related primarily to additions in our technical and administrative staff during fy  and o expenses associated with the annual meeting of stockholders 
results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  in the year ended july  fy compared to a loss of  in the year ended july  fy 
the increase in our fy net loss resulted from increases in research and development expenses to  from  and in general and administrative expenses to  from 
our net interest and miscellaneous income in fy increased to  from a net expense of  in fy  primarily as a result of increased interest income in fy the principal reasons for the increase in our research and development expense in fy were o increased expenditures relating to clinical trials of our oral insulin formulation primarily attributable to the expanded scope of these trials in fy to include additional sites in the united states and europe  and the fact that trials did not commence in fy until the second quarter  and o costs associated with operations of our pilot manufacturing facility in toronto which supports our clinical program 
the principal reasons for the increase in our general and administrative expenses in fy were o an increase of  in legal and accounting fees and expenses to  from  related primarily to legal and accounting services in connection with reporting requirements under the securities and exchange act of  litigation defense costs and increased legal activity necessitated by increased business activity  o increased personnel costs of  to  from  related primarily to additions to our technical and administrative staff during fy  and o increased travel and other costs of  to  from  associated with attendance at and sponsorship of industry seminars and exhibitions and other promotional activities 
in both of the last two fiscal years  we incurred substantial expenses for financial advisory and other financing services that were not related to a specific financing and  therefore  were accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  in fy and  in fy were paid primarily through the issuance of shares of common stock and or warrants and options to purchase common stock 
we believe that any similar expenses incurred in the current fiscal year will not exceed the level of such expenses in fy liquidity and capital resources to date we have financed our development stage activities primarily through private placements of common stock 
in fy  we issued approximately million shares of common stock for cash proceeds of approximately million net of financing costs of approximately million 
additionally  we granted stock options  warrants and shares of common stock to consultants  advisors and employees with a value of  for services rendered  of which  was included in financing costs 
as a result of our sales of common stock for cash and our use of stock options  warrants and shares of common stock to pay for certain services during fy  our stockholders equity increased to approximately million at july   versus approximately million at july   notwithstanding our net loss during the year 
at july   we had on hand cash and short term investments primarily notes of us corporations of approximately million versus million at july  in the final quarter of fy  we received additional equity capital of approximately  from the sale of  shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants 
in the final quarter of fy  we received additional equity capital of approximately million net of financing costs of approximately 
million from two private placements of units of securities consisting of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 
shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
we believe that our current cash position is sufficient to meet all of our working capital needs for at least the next months 
beyond that  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise funds through private or public equity financing or from other sources 
if we were unable to raise additional capital as needed  we could be required to scale back or otherwise revise our business plan 
any significant scale back of operations or modification of our business plan due to a lack of funding could be expected to materially and adversely affect our prospects 
in the past we have funded most of our development and other costs with equity financing 
while we have been able to raise equity capital as required  unforeseen problems with our clinical program or materially negative developments in general economic conditions could interfere with our ability to raise additional equity capital as needed  or materially adversely affect the terms upon which such capital is available 
transactions with affiliates on may   the company s three senior officers  who are also shareholders of the company  were advanced  each  in exchange for promissory notes 
these notes bear interest at percent per annum and are payable in full on may  these notes are guaranteed by a related company owned by these officers and secured by a pledge of  shares of the company s common stock currently owned by this related company 
as of july   the balance outstanding on these notes  including accrued interest  was  prior to january   a portion of our general and administrative expenses resulted from transactions with affiliated persons  and a number of capital transactions also involved affiliated persons 
although these transactions were not the result of arms length negotiations  we do not believe that this fact had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
prior to december   we classified certain payments to executive officers for compensation and expense reimbursements as research and development related party because the executive officers received such payments through personal services corporations rather than directly 
after december   these payments have been and will continue to be accounted for as though the payments were made directly to the officers  and not as a related party transaction 
we do not foresee a need for  and therefore do not anticipate  any related party transactions in the current fiscal year
