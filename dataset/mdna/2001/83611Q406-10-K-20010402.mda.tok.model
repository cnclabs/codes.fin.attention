current market environment as an investment banking firm  our business and operations are effected by the us and global economic environment and market conditions 
commencing in mid april  the market for public equity offerings slowed from the levels and strength experienced in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as a result  for the majority of the second  third and fourth quarters of  we were operating under market conditions that were unfavorable to potential issuers 
the volatility of the equity markets  and in particular the market for technology companies  has the potential to influence the strength of our business operations 
sequentially  from the first to the third quarters of  we experienced a decline in investment banking revenues as a result of these unfavorable market conditions for technology companies 
during the fourth quarter  we experienced a further decline in investment banking revenue derived from public equity offerings  which was offset by an increase in revenue derived from our m a services 
with the market for public issuances and technology companies in general remaining unfavorable  we expect total revenues to decrease in the first and second quarters of from levels achieved in the comparative periods in further  we may experience a decline in total revenues in from the level achieved in from our founding in through the first nine months of  we were engaged in organizational activities 
during the last quarter of and the first quarter of  we were in an early stage of our operations  and generated only minimal revenues from our investment banking and brokerage activities 
accordingly  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
as a result of our merger with soundview we believe that our results of operations for the past four years will not be indicative of the results for any future period 
the financial information presented and discussed below and elsewhere in this document includes the results of the merger with soundview beginning january   the closing date of that merger  and includes the results of the merger with e offering beginning october   the closing date of that merger 
results of operations for the years ended december    and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investment banking revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investment banking revenue is primarily derived from the public offering of equity securities  and also from mergers and acquisitions and strategic advisory services and private equity offerings 
the increase in investment banking revenue in as compared to and is attributable to our acquisition of soundview as well as increased economics in public offerings in which we participated and an increased contribution from our mergers and acquisitions advisory services 
we participated in a total of securities offerings during  as co manager and as syndicate member 
for the year ended december   our mergers and acquisitions and financial advisory group advised on transactions with a combined value of over billion 
during  the revenue generated from underwriting activities was limited since we received none or only negligible portions of management fees paid to co managing underwriters  and underwriting sales credits reflected limited allocations of the shares being underwritten 
in  approximately of this revenue was generated from one financial advisory transaction in connection with the sale of a client company 
during  we began to receive management fees and larger allocations of the shares in offerings  and have experienced a general increase in the number of offerings in which we participated

for the years ended december  and all of our brokerage revenue was derived from our retail online brokerage operations 
the increase in revenue derived from our online business for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and resulted primarily from an increase in the number of active customer accounts and an increase in the number of trades executed for online customers  offset by lower trading volumes as a result of market conditions and the announcement of our strategic alliance with e trade 
during  we experienced a sequential increase in our institutional brokerage revenue as a result of increased trading volumes  an increase in the number of companies under research coverage and an increase in the number of stocks for which we make a market 
however  we can experience increases or decreases in this revenue depending on market conditions and volatility 
independent of those market factors  we expect this revenue to continue to increase as we continue to grow our institutional brokerage business and capitalize on our opportunity to receive order flow in securities for which we act as market maker from e trade 
on september   as part of our strategic alliance with e trade  we transferred approximately  online retail brokerage accounts to e trade 
as a result of this transfer  these online customers will no longer execute secondary market transactions through us and we will not derive further brokerage revenue from these operations 
additionally  we expect to reduce our direct and indirect expenses related to our online retail brokerage operations 
asset management fees for the year ended december  increased to million from  for the year ended december  and in this revenue is derived from management and syndication fees received from our series of venture capital funds which closed primarily during the first quarter of and from incentive royalties from hedge funds that were formerly managed by soundview 
in late  we had commenced our venture capital operations having closed wit vc fund i  lp  from which  in management fee income was derived

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary risk exposures are market risk particularly equity price  credit risk and legal risk 
market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of equity prices  interest rates or other factors could result in trading losses or negatively impact the market for equity issuance 
credit and legal risk refers to the risk that a counterparty to a transaction might fail to perform under its contractual commitment resulting in our incurring losses 
our risk management focuses on the trading of securities  extension of credit to counterparties and investment banking activities  as well as the monitoring of trading levels with institutional customers 
we monitor these risks daily through a number of control procedures in order to identify and evaluate the various risks to which our company is exposed 
market risk we may act as a principal to facilitate customer related transactions in financial instruments which exposes the firm to market risks 
as of december   we make markets in equity securities 
as such  we maintain securities inventories to facilitate customer transactions 
our management believes its practice of monitoring market risk very closely and we believe that our risk management results in a carefully controlled exposure to market volatility that should reduce our exposure to earnings volatility 
managing market risk exposure includes limiting firm commitments by position level both long and short for all securities traded and limiting the type of trades that can occur in each inventory account 
we seek to manage daily risk exposure in our inventory accounts by requiring various levels of management review of these accounts 
the primary purpose of risk management is to participate in the establishment of position limits  as well as to monitor both the buy and sell activity in the firm s trading accounts 
trading activities may result in the creation of inventory positions 
position and exposure reports indicating both long and short position are prepared  distributed and reviewed each day 
these reports enable us to monitor inventory levels  monitor daily trading results by stock and trader  as well as review inventory aging  pricing and concentration 
we invest our excess cash in money market funds and in enhanced income funds which include short term obligations issued by the us government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
our investments in enhanced income funds exposes us to market risk for changes in interest rates 
we have established investment guidelines that specify credit quality requirements as well as diversification requirements by issuer and type of security 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
credit risk our exposure to credit risk arises from the possibility that a counterparty to a transaction might fail to perform under its contractual commitment  resulting in our incurring losses 
credit risk related to various financing activities is reduced by the industry practice of obtaining and maintaining possession and control of collateral which is accomplished with established arrangements with the clearing broker 
along with our clearing broker  we manage the credit exposure relating to our trading activities by monitoring the credit worthiness of counterparties requesting additional collateral when deemed necessary and limiting the amount and duration of exposure to individual counterparties 
legal risk legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
we have established legal standards and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
we have also established procedures that are designed to monitor compliance with senior management s policies relating to conduct  ethics and business practices 
in connection with our business  we have various procedures that address issues such as regulatory capital requirements  trading and sales practices  supervision  and record keeping 
we have also established certain procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable  including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity  adequacy or legal documentation  the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies
