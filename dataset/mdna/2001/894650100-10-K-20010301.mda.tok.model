item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic film and aluminum extrusions 
we also have two operating subsidiaries focused on healthcare related technologies and an investment subsidiary 
descriptions of our businesses and interests are provided on pages our manufacturing businesses are quite different from our technology interests 
our manufacturing businesses can be analyzed and valued by traditional measures of earnings and cash flow  and because they generate positive ongoing cash flow  they can be leveraged with borrowed funds 
our technology operating companies  molecumetics and therics  are start up companies active in drug research  drug delivery and tissue engineering 
each generates operating losses and negative cash flow in the form of net r d expenditures 
neither has licensed products to date  and revenues consist entirely of collaboration revenues r d support payments 
they may never generate profits or positive cash flow 
if they were stand alone  independent operations  they would typically be financed by private venture capital 
our investment subsidiary represents high risk stakes in technology start up companies  primarily in the areas of communications  life sciences and information technology 
our primary objective in the investment area is to generate high after tax internal rates of return commensurate with the level of risk involved 
in summary  we have a variety of business interests with dramatically different risk profiles  which makes the communication of operating results more difficult  especially since we have only one class of stock 
as a result  the segment information presented on pages  and the business segment review on pages  are critical to the understanding of our operating results and business risks 
on october   we announced a series of strategic inititatives aimed at accelerating the growth of therics and molecumetics 
we will significantly increase therics product development spending and are exploring external financing and other strategic alternatives to fund the growth of molecumetics 
we will use cash generated by our existing venture capital investments to support more aggressive spending at therics 
as part of the plan  we will reduce future investments in our venture portfolio  which is expected to yield positive cash flows over the next few years 
this cash is expected to be more than adequate to fund the increased spending at therics 
we plan to invest approximately million million net of expected tax benefits in therics over the next three years  with the goal of achieving substantial revenue and profit growth by we believe therics is making encouraging progress in its development of bone replacement and reconstructive products as well as implantable and oral drugs 
therics operating losses could reach million per year in and our goal is for therics to begin generating revenue and reducing losses in  with rapid growth in sales and profits thereafter 
our plan is to pursue the quickest route to profitability by focusing on commercializing our bone replacement products while continuing to develop our drug delivery and tissue engineering technologies 
we expect the first of our bone replacement products to clear fda regulatory hurdles in early full scale marketing efforts are planned to begin in we also announced the exploration of external financing and other strategic alternatives for molecumetics 
molecumetics uses proprietary chemistry and an integrated set of drug discovery capabilities to accelerate the identification of novel drug candidates 
external financing would fund higher spending levels and reduce new cash outlays from tredegar 
however  due to accounting principles  our earnings may reflect up to million per year in operating losses from molecumetics in and in order to accelerate efforts to build our technology operations  we have decided to harvest our existing venture portfolio 
we intend to fund existing commitments and support existing portfolio companies 
results of operations versus revenues 
net sales in increased by over due primarily to the acquisition of exxon films and overall higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs 
assuming the acquisition of exxon films occurred at the beginning of  pro forma net sales for were relatively flat with higher sales in aluminum extrusions up  due primarily to raw material driven price increases  were partially offset by lower pro forma sales in film products down

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tredegar has exposure to the volatility of interest rates  polyethylene and polypropylene resin prices  aluminum ingot and scrap prices  foreign currencies  emerging markets and technology stocks 
see note on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products  however  those changes are generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices but are also generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices  however  there is no assurance that higher ingot costs can be passed along to customers 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than twelve months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information 
we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign operations and through exports from us plants

we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
our foreign operations in emerging markets have agreements with certain customers that index the pricing of our products to the us dollar  the german mark or the euro 
our foreign currency exposure on income from foreign operations in europe primarily relates to the german mark and the euro 
we believe that our exposure to the canadian dollar has been substantially neutralized by the us dollar based spread the difference between selling prices and aluminum costs generated from canadian casting operations and exports from canada to the us the acquisition of exxon films on may   has increased the proportion of assets located in the us it has also increased the amount of operating profit earned in the us  but this has been more than offset by higher us dollar interest expense on debt related to the acquisition 
we have investments in private venture capital fund limited partnerships and early stage technology companies  including the stock of privately held companies and the restricted and unrestricted stock of companies that have recently registered shares in initial public offerings 
the portfolio is subject to risks typically associated with investments in technology start up companies  which include business failure  illiquidity and stock market volatility 
furthermore  publicly traded stocks of emerging  technology based companies have higher volatility and risk than the us stock market as a whole 
see the business segment review which begins below and note on page for more information 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has issued a new standard affecting the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are either recognized periodically in income or other comprehensive income 
the accounting for our futures contracts to hedge aluminum price risk will be affected by this new standard 
we have adopted this standard effective january  the adoption did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position
