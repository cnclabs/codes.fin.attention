item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily receive our revenue from earned premium from derived from our insurance company operations  management fees generated by our underwriting agency operations  commission income produced by our intermediary operations  investment income from all of our operations and capital and other operating income 
our core underwriting activities involve providing accident and health reinsurance and aviation  marine and offshore energy  medical stop loss  property and workers compensation insurance  each of which is marketed either directly to customers or through a network of independent or affiliated agents and brokers 
during the past several years  we have substantially increased our shareholders equity through the issuance of equity securities and through our retained earnings  thereby enabling us to increase the underwriting capacity of our insurance companies 
with this additional equity  we increased underwriting activity across many of our core lines of business  emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in the insurance cycle 
as an insurer  we also purchase reinsurance for each of our lines of business 
we purchase different types of reinsurance in amounts we consider appropriate for each of our lines of business based upon market conditions and the level of risk we wish to retain 
during and  our underwriting agencies underwrote aviation  medical stop loss  occupational accident and workers compensation insurance and a variety of accident and health related insurance and reinsurance products on behalf of our insurance companies and unaffiliated insurance companies 
our underwriting agency activities are fee based and non risk bearing 
effective january   in conjunction with the expansion of underwriting activities by our insurance companies and in an effort to streamline certain of our operations  we consolidated the operations of certain of our agency operations  with those of certain of our insurance companies 
we have consolidated the operations of our domestic general aviation underwriting agency  hcc aviation  and our occupational accident and workers compensation underwriting agency  hcc employer services  with those of us specialty  and the operations of our london based accident and health reinsurance underwriting agency subsidiary  ldg re london  with those of the london branch of houston casualty 
these consolidations will result in a reduction in management fee income and the net earnings from our underwriting agency segment  but such reduction will be more than offset over time by increases in net earnings of our insurance company segment 
the cost of this restructuring was million after tax and was recorded in the fourth quarter of a total of employees were or will be terminated as a result of this consolidation 
as market conditions warrant  we anticipate reviewing our other agency operations to determine if similar consolidation activities will provide greater operating efficiencies 
our intermediaries are fee based  non risk bearing and place reinsurance for our insurance companies and underwriting agencies and for other non affiliated insurance companies and risk taking entities  as well as insurance on behalf of medium and large corporate clients 
other operating income is generated through our insurance services operations  which support our own operations as well as provide services for other clients 
additionally  other operating income may include the equity in the earnings of a company in which we invest  dividends or gains or losses from the disposition of these investments 
from through  in response to adverse market conditions  we focused our acquisition activities on expanding our underwriting agency and intermediary operations for three principal reasons to increase the management fees and commission income components of our total revenue  which we believed were a more predictable and stable source of revenue than the potential underwriting gain from insurance company operations during periods of overly competitive pricing  to insulate our company from a decline in our revenue growth rate as insurance premium rates became more competitive in our specialty lines of business and we became more selective in our underwriting  resulting in reduced earned premium  to provide a future source of premium revenue to our insurance companies and greater control of premium distribution channels 
in  due to a reduction in reinsurance capacity  rates began to increase  particularly in the accident and health reinsurance  general aviation and medical stop loss lines of business 
market conditions continued to improve in and we anticipate further improvement in in response to these changing market conditions  we plan to continue to expand these underwriting activities in our insurance companies and in our other lines of business as they also improve 
during december   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the centris group  inc in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations and cash flows of centris are included in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the twelve months ended december   but are not included in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings and cash flows for the twelve months ended december  and earlier periods 
centris was the parent corporation of a group of insurance companies and underwriting agencies principally operating in the medical stop loss line of business 
centris primary insurance company subsidiary was the entity now known as hcc life insurance company 
following the acquisition  hcc life s operations were relocated to houston  and it became a subsidiary of houston casualty 
centris medical stop loss underwriting agency operations have been combined with hcc benefits operations 
since the date of the acquisition  the premium rates for medical stop loss have increased substantially and the loss ratio has greatly improved for the business underwritten by the combined operations 
in connection with the integration of centris operations with our own  we took a restructuring charge  which was accrued at the date of acquisition 
from through  our employee count had grown from less than to more than  in the fourth quarter of  we determined  based upon a review of our operations  that our operating efficiency and profitability could be enhanced principally by reducing the employee count in certain operations 
we therefore implemented a restructuring plan which resulted in the termination of of our employees during this restructuring resulted in a decreased level of operating expenses in for the operating entities affected 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain premium revenue information for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands direct    reinsurance assumed    gross written premium    reinsurance ceded    net written premium    change in unearned premium    net earned premium    the following table sets forth the relationships of certain income statement items as a percent of total revenue for the three years ended december net earned premium management fees commission income net investment income net realized investment gain loss other operating income total revenue loss and lae net operating expense interest expense earnings before income tax provision income tax provision net earnings before accounting change includes provision for reinsurance in year ended december  versus year ended december  our total revenue increased to million in compared to this revenue increase resulted from the higher retention of premium underwritten by our insurance companies  particularly in the medical stop loss line of business  and increased investment income 
we expect the upward trend in revenue to continue 
our net investment income increased to million in compared to this increase was primarily due to a higher level of invested assets which resulted from the greater retentions of premium underwritten by our insurance companies  the investment of cash received during the first quarter of from our commutation with a reinsurer and cash flow from operations 
we expect cash flow to continue to improve  thereby increasing net investment income  which could be substantially offset by falling interest rates 
in  we engaged general re new england asset management  a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway  inc and a nationally prominent investment advisor  particularly to insurance companies  and undertook an in depth review and restructuring of our investment portfolio 
as a part of this restructuring  we have shortened our investment portfolio s duration but have not significantly changed the average credit rating 
our net realized investment losses from sales or write downs of equity securities was million in  compared to losses of million in in  we recognized a million realized loss from the write down of an equity investment to its estimated fair market value based upon market quotations compared to a similar write down of million in our net realized investment gains from the disposition of fixed income securities were  in  compared to losses of  in our compensation expense increased to million during from million in this increase reflects a normal progressional increase due to business growth plus the increase due to the centris acquisition  offset by the savings resulting from the fourth quarter restructuring and the sale of non core subsidiaries 
other than the restructuring expenses discussed below  other operating expenses increased to million from million for similar reasons 
included in other operating expense are restructuring expenses of  in and million in currency conversion losses amounted to  in  compared to gains of  in our interest expense was million in compared to million in this increase is a result of higher interest rates and increased debt outstanding  principally as a result of funding the centris acquisition 
interest expense will be down substantially in as a result of our reduced level of debt following our equity offering in march  our income tax expense was million in compared to million in our effective tax rate was in the period compared to in most of the increase in the effective tax rate was due to non deductible goodwill amortization relating to the centris acquisition  a shift of fixed income investments to taxable instruments from tax exempt instruments and increased underwriting agency income which is subject to state income taxes 
our net earnings in increased to million or per diluted share from million or per diluted share in these increases result principally from improved underwriting results  an increase in investment income and the effects of the provision for reinsurance and a larger restructuring expense recorded during in  we incurred a million after tax charge for a change in accounting principles to conform our agency and intermediary revenue recognition principles to those required by the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin number entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
the change was not material to earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change for our book value per share was as of december   up from as of december  during march  we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
if this transaction had occurred on december   our pro forma book value per share would have increased to segments insurance companies gross written premium generated by our insurance companies increased to million in compared to due to new business  rate increases  increased participation by our insurance companies in the business underwritten by our underwriting agencies and the acquisition of centris 
net written premium generated by our insurance companies in increased to million compared to  as our insurance companies have increased retentions in many of their lines of business as underwriting results showed improvement 
net earned premium increased to million during for the same reasons 
we expect net premium increases to continue in loss and loss adjustment expense incurred by our insurance companies increased to million in from million in the increase in net loss and loss adjustment expense is due to the higher level of net retained premium  net of the effect of improved underwriting results 
the gaap net loss ratio decreased to in from in in  we also recorded a million increase in reserves for discontinued lines of business acquired with our acquisition of centris 
this increase represents of the net loss ratio 
the gaap gross loss ratio decreased to in from in the general improvement in our loss ratios result from the effects of increased premium rates in certain lines of business  reduced writings in other unprofitable lines of business and a general improvement in market conditions  particularly in the domestic aviation and medical stop loss lines of business 
the statutory net combined ratio of our insurance companies was for compared to excluding effects of the provision for reinsurance in during  we had net loss and lae redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a deficiency of million in and we had gross loss and lae redundancy of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency results from two principal conditions 
the first is the development of large claims on individual policies which were either reported late or for which reserves were increased as subsequent information became available 
however  as these policies were substantially reinsured  there was no material effect to our net earnings 
secondly  during in connection with the insolvency of one of our reinsurers and with the commutation  finalized subsequent to year end  of all liabilities with another  we re evaluated all loss reserves and incurred but not reported loss reserves related to business placed with these reinsurers to determine the ultimate losses we might conservatively expect 
these reserves were then used as the basis for the determination of the provision for reinsurance recorded in the other deficiencies and redundancies in the reserves result from our continued review with our actuaries of loss reserves and the increase or reduction of such reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
we continue to believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses 
policy acquisition costs  which are net of commissions on ceded reinsurance  increased to million during from million for this increase in costs results from higher retained premium and the resulting reduced ceding commissions 
net earnings of our insurance companies increased to million in from a loss of million in  primarily as a result of improved underwriting results  the effect of the provision for reinsurance recorded in and the increase in investment income 
underwriting agencies premiums underwritten by our underwriting agencies increased to billion for compared to management fees generated by our underwriting agencies increased to million in compared to these increases resulted primarily from the increased premium volume in the medical stop loss line of business  which was due to rate increases and the centris acquisition 
the increase in management fees was disproportionate to the increase in written premium as a result of higher policy issuance fees and increased retentions by our insurance companies which reduced management fees earned by our underwriting agencies 
these reductions are offset by an equal reduction in net policy acquisition costs of our insurance companies 
net earnings of our underwriting agencies increased to million in from million in due to increased revenue  a smaller restructuring charge in than in and higher pretax margins primarily as a result of the successful integration of the centris acquisition 
intermediaries commission income decreased to million in from million in net earnings of our intermediary subsidiaries decreased to million in from million in these decreases were due to a significant reduction in the amount of ceded reinsurance placed on behalf of our insurance companies as a result of their planned increase in retentions 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of schanen consulting for  shares of our common stock 
this transaction will be recorded using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
schanen consulting s operations have been consolidated with those of hcc employee benefits  our specialty retail employee benefits agency 
other operations other operating revenue decreased to million during from million for the same period in net earnings of our other operations decreased to million in from million in revenue and earnings can vary considerably from period to period depending on investment or disposition activity 
restructuring as of december   we accrued a restructuring liability of million related to our ongoing operations 
as of december   all restructuring costs had been paid or adjusted with the exception of a remaining liability of  during  we determined that one of the leased offices scheduled to be closed would be retained 
therefore  we reversed  included as a credit in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements of the restructuring expense recorded during the fourth quarter of  of which  was the reversal of the accrual for future lease payments and  was the reversal of the write off of certain assets 
as of december   we had also accrued a restructuring liability related to our acquisition of centris 
changes in the accrual between december  and december  are shown in the table below accrued paid accrued at in adjustments at contractual executive severance accruals     other severance accruals     lease obligation accruals     total     the adjustments in were recorded as management decided to take additional steps to integrate parts of the centris operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we also recorded a restructuring charge and associated expenses of million 
a total of employees were or will be terminated as a result of our restructuring of certain underwriting agency operations and their integration into our insurance company operations 
the charges affected both segments and consisted of  accrued severance pay to be paid at various times throughout and  for the write down or write off of various impaired assets  primarily redundant computer software 
year ended december  versus year ended december  our revenue increased to million in  from million in the revenue increase was principally a result of increases in non risk bearing management fees and commission income 
this growth is from new business and acquisitions 
our net investment income increased to million in from million in  reflecting a slightly higher level of investment assets and increased interest rates earned on short term investments 
our net realized investment losses from sales or write downs of equity securities were million in  compared to losses of  in in  we recognized a million realized loss from the write down of one equity investment to its estimated fair market value based upon market quotations 
our net realized investment losses from the disposition of fixed income securities were  in  compared to gains of million in the losses in resulted from the sale of bonds in connection with the funding of the centris acquisition 
our compensation expense increased to million in  from million in this increase reflects a normal progressional increase due to business growth as well as the effect of acquisitions 
other operating expenses increased million to million  before restructuring expenses of million  during the same period for similar reasons 
our currency conversion gains amounted to  in  compared to gains of  in we recorded a restructuring charge and associated expenses of million during the fourth quarter of since our initial public offering in  we have completed more than fifteen acquisitions 
during that time  total employees had grown from less than to more than  as a result of this rapid growth  we believe certain operating inefficiencies occurred 
at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we made a review of our operations and determined that they could be made more efficient  principally by reducing the employee count in certain operations 
we believe that this restructuring will strengthen our corporate and management structure and enhance future earnings by improving operating efficiency and therefore profitability 
the charge included severance pay of million for employees  million related to lease costs of office space made redundant as a result of the restructuring plan and an asset write down of  principally of leasehold improvements  and other assets related to the redundant space 
our interest expense was million for  an increase of million from the increase is a result of increased debt outstanding as a result of funding for acquisitions 
our income tax expense was million in compared to million in the decrease was due to the reduction in earnings before income tax 
our effective tax rate for both years was approximately the same 
our net earnings in decreased to million from million in  due to the provision for reinsurance  which equated to million after income taxes  or per diluted share  the higher net loss ratio and the restructuring expense  which  after income taxes  amounted to per diluted share 
diluted earnings per share decreased to per share from per share during the same period 
our book value per share was as of december   up from as of december  segments insurance companies gross written premium for our insurance companies increased to million in  from million in our accident and health reinsurance  medical stop loss and workers compensation lines of business showed strong growth because our insurance companies continued to participate in more of the business written by our underwriting agencies 
this growth was partially offset by reductions in offshore energy and property premium as a result of the continuing extremely soft conditions in these markets 
net written premium for our insurance companies increased in to million from million in  as a result of increases in retained aviation and medical stop loss premium 
net earned premium decreased slightly in to million from million in as changes in earned premium lag behind changes in written premium 
loss and loss adjustment expense incurred by our insurance companies increased to million in  from million in  and the gaap net loss ratio increased to in  from in the gaap gross loss ratio was in compared to in the deterioration is primarily from poor results in the aviation  medical stop loss and property lines of business 
we have taken steps to reduce these gross loss ratios  primarily by increasing premium rates and more selective underwriting 
the statutory net combined ratio was excluding the effects of the provision for reinsurance in compared to in during  we had a net loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in during  we had a gross loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency results from two principal conditions 
the first is the development of large claims on individual policies which were either reported late or for which reserves were increased as subsequent information became available 
however  because these policies were substantially reinsured  there was no material effect to our net earnings 
secondly  during  in connection with the insolvency of one of our reinsurers and with the commutation of all liabilities of another  we re evaluated all loss reserves and incurred but not reported loss reserves related to business placed with these reinsurers to determine the ultimate losses we might conservatively expect 
these reserves were then used as the basis for the determination of the provision for reinsurance we recorded in the other deficiencies and redundancies in the reserves result from our continued review with our actuaries of loss reserves and the increase or reduction of those reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
in  our insurance companies recorded a million provision for reinsurance to reflect an estimated million pre tax loss for the insolvency of a reinsurer and an estimated million pre tax loss  the majority of which represents the discount on ceded reserves related to the commutation we initiated of all liabilities with another reinsurer 
the commutation was settled for cash and other assets totaling million in february  our insurance companies policy acquisition costs  which are net of ceding commissions on reinsurance ceded  decreased million to million in  from million in this decrease reflects a greater amount of gross premium ceded and  therefore  a higher level of ceding commissions 
net earnings of our insurance companies decreased to a loss of million in  from a profit of million in  as a result of the provision for reinsurance  the effect of restructuring and the higher net loss ratio 
underwriting agencies management fees generated by our underwriting agencies increased to million in  from million in premium underwritten on behalf of both our insurance companies and other insurance companies increased to million in  an increase of from million in both increases resulted from acquisitions and internal growth of existing operations 
the underwriting agency segment also incurred a million  net of income tax  restructuring expense in in addition to its impact on the agency segment  growth in underwriting agency premium has a positive impact on both the insurance company segment and the intermediary segment 
net earnings of our underwriting agencies decreased to million in  from million in acquisitions made during and had not yet had a positive impact on net earnings due to licensing and other regulatory requirements  which were still in process 
intermediaries commission income generated by our intermediaries increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of the january  acquisition of rattner mackenzie 
net earnings of the intermediaries decreased to million in from million in the increase in net earnings generated by rattner mackenzie was offset by fewer large brokerage transactions in and other reductions  including a  net of income tax restructuring expense in other operations our other operating revenue increased to million in  from million in there was a general increase in revenue of the service operations  net of the decrease in revenue related to operations disposed of in late other operating net earnings increased to million in  from million in due principally to the higher earnings of the service operations 
revenue and earnings can vary considerably from period to period depending on investment or disposition activity 
liquidity and capital resources we receive substantial cash from premiums  reinsurance recoverables  and management fee and commission income and  to a lesser extent  investment income  and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and other assets 
our principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and loss adjustment expenses  payment of premiums to reinsurers  purchase of investments  debt service  and repayment policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  income and other taxes and dividends 
variations in operating cash flows can occur due to timing differences in either the payment of claims and the collection of related recoverables or the collection of receivables and the payment of related payable amounts 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit and other security such that net balances due to us are less than the gross balances shown in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain a substantial level of cash and liquid short term investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations 
our consolidated cash and investment portfolio increased million  or since december   and totaled million as of december   of which million was cash and short term investments 
the increase in investments resulted from increased operating cash flows and from the collection of a commutation receivable 
total assets increased slightly to billion as of december  our investment portfolio includes a high percentage of liquid investments and generates a significant amount of investment income  which serves as a source of cash flow 
the average tax equivalent yield on investments was in  compared to in the weighted average duration of the portfolio was four years as of december  over of our fixed income securities were rated a or better by standard poor s 
the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of our portfolio will mature at any point in time 
as of december   certain of our subsidiaries maintained revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of million available through december  advances under the lines of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws  if any  on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short term direct cash advances 
the lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market value of up to million  the actual amount of collateral at any one time being of the aggregate amount outstanding 
interest on the lines is payable at the bank s prime rate of interest less at december  
at december   letters of credit totaling million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries  with total securities of million collateralizing the lines 
during march  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering amounted to approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
most of the proceeds  million  were used to pay down our bank facility 
on december   we entered into a million revolving loan facility with a group of banks 
we can borrow up to million under the facility on a revolving basis until it expires on december  outstanding advances under the facility bear interest at agreed upon rates 
the facility is collateralized in part by the pledge of the stock of houston casualty and avemco insurance and by the stock of and guarantees entered into by our principal underwriting agency and intermediary subsidiaries 
the facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including minimum net worth requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries  restrictions on certain extraordinary corporate actions  notice requirements for certain material occurrences  and required maintenance of specified financial ratios 
we believe that the restrictive covenants and our obligations that are contained in the facility agreement are typical for financing arrangements comparable to our facility 
as of december   total debt outstanding under the facility was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
during march  we reduced debt outstanding under the facility to million using the proceeds from our recent public stock offering 
property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the state of texas are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any twelve month period  without the prior written consent of the commissioner of insurance  to the greater of statutory net income for the prior calendar year or of its statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
houston casualty and us specialty  both texas domiciled companies  paid no dividends in or during  houston casualty s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million and us specialty s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million 
under the laws of the state of maryland  avemco insurance may only pay dividends out of statutory earned surplus 
the maximum amount of dividends that avemco insurance may pay without prior regulatory approval in any twelve month period is the greater of its statutory net income under certain conditions for the prior calendar year or of its statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
avemco insurance paid an extraordinary dividend of million during december   but paid no dividends during during  avemco insurance will have an ordinary dividend capacity of approximately million 
hcc life insurance company is limited by the laws of the state of indiana in the amount of dividends it may pay in any twelve month period  without prior regulatory approval  to the greater of its statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year or of its policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
hcc life paid no dividends in during  hcc life s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million compared to million as of december  due to our history of consistent earnings and expectations for future earnings and to the ability to carry losses back to profitable years for tax purposes  we expect to be able to fully realize the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
the overall increase in underwriting activity by our insurance companies and the centris acquisition in december  resulted in increases in gross loss reserves  life and annuity policy benefits and gross unearned premiums 
related amounts of reinsurance recoverables  ceded life and policy benefits and ceded unearned premium also increased 
we continue to collect our receivables and recoverables generally in the ordinary course of business and we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any significant liquidity difficulties as a result of the substantial growth in gross amounts due 
however  during  a number of reinsurers have delayed or suspended the payment of amounts recoverable under certain reinsurance contracts to which we are a party 
such delays have affected  though not materially to date  the investment income of our insurance companies  but not to any extent their liquidity 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit or other security such that net balances due are significantly less than the gross balances shown in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  a number of reinsurers have claimed they are not liable for payment to us and  in one or more cases  have sought arbitration of these matters 
we believe these claims are without merit and expect to collect the full amount recoverable 
we are currently in negotiations with most of these parties 
if such negotiations do not result in a satisfactory resolution of the matters in question  we will seek a judicial or arbitral determination of these matters 
as of december   each of our domestic insurance companies total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital level prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners 
regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gross written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and net written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
however  industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at and  respectively 
in the past  our property and casualty insurance companies have maintained premium to surplus ratios significantly lower than such guidelines and generally below industry norms 
for the year ended december   our statutory gross written premium to policyholders surplus was compared to for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our statutory net written premium to policyholders surplus was compared to for the year ended december  the gross written premium ratio has increased during with the acquisition of centris book of medical stop loss business and the increasing use of our insurance companies as the issuing company for business written by our underwriting agencies 
this ratio is expected to stabilize at or decrease from its level as statutory policyholders surplus increases due to the retention of earnings and other increases in policyholders surplus 
impact of inflation our operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense are known 
although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates  for competitive reasons  such premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation 
however  because the majority of our business is comprised of lines which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event  reporting of the claims to us and the final settlement of the claims  the effects of inflation are minimized 
a significant portion of our revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products that are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of healthcare costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue  but also higher claim payments 
inflation may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
we do not specifically provide for inflation when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves  although we do consider trends 
we continually review claim reserves to assess their adequacy and make necessary adjustments 
also  the market value of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions and interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our investments 
in addition  the interest rate payable under our million bank loan floats with that of the market 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  depending on the amount borrowed on our bank facility 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations we underwrite risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have receivables and payables in foreign currencies and we establish and maintain loss reserves with respect to our insurance policies in their respective currencies 
our net earnings could be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations affecting these balances 
our principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the major european currencies and the us dollar 
for the year ended december   our loss from currency conversion was  compared to gains of  in and  in on a limited basis  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
rattner mackenzie has revenue streams in us dollars and canadian dollars cad but its expenses are paid in british pound sterling gbp 
to mitigate our foreign exchange risk  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts expiring at staggered times through december  as of december  we had forward contracts to sell us million for gbp at an average rate of gbp equals us and to sell cad  for gbp at an average exchange rate of gbp equals cad 
this compares with december  when we had forward contracts to sell us million for gbp at an average rate of gbp equals us 
the foreign currency forward contracts are used to convert currency at a known rate in an amount which approximates average monthly expenses 
this permits us to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the recurring monthly expenses 
in the future  we may continue to limit our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
we utilize these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations rather than as a form of speculation or trading investment 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued in june  and became effective for us january  we utilize derivatives or hedging strategies on a limited basis 
the cumulative effect adjustment due to this change in accounting has been calculated by us and is not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows nor do we expect the adoption of sfas no 
to be material on an ongoing basis due to our limited use of derivatives 
the national association of insurance commissioners adopted statements of statutory accounting principles in march  as a product of its attempt to codify statutory accounting principles 
although subject to adoption by the individual states  an effective date of january  was established for implementation of the statements 
prior to the codification project  a comprehensive guide to statutory accounting principles did not exist 
codification is new and will evolve over time 
the cumulative effect of codification is expected to increase statutory policyholders surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries by approximately million 
we expect that the statutory surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries after adoption will continue to be in excess of their regulatory risk based capital requirements 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board has recently announced that it proposes to change the accounting for certain acquisitions and goodwill 
this pronouncement  if finally adopted  could affect the way we account for and the structure of future acquisitions 
final rules implementing the announced standards are not expected until the second quarter of and no date has been established for adopting the final standards 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union irrevocably fixed the conversion rates between their national currencies and a common currency  the euro  which became the common legal currency of those countries on that date 
the participating countries former national currencies will continue to serve as legal tender and as denominations of the euro until january  the conversion to the euro is scheduled to be completed on july   when the national currencies will cease to exist 
we do not expect the introduction of the euro to have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed income securities and interest expense on variable rate debt  equity risk on marketable equity securities  credit risk on reinsurance recoverables and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to manage the exposures of our investment risks  we generally invest in investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of the insurance liabilities of our insurance companies 
we have not historically used derivatives to manage any of our investment related market risks 
caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially from estimates below for a variety of reasons  including  among other things amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to change over time  assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate  market changes could be different from market changes assumed below  and not all factors and balances are taken into account 
interest rate risk the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million and was million  as of december  if market interest rates were to change  eg from to the fair value of our fixed income securities would change approximately million as of december  this compares to change in value of million as of december  for the same change in market interest rates 
the change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
our million bank loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense is directly correlated to market interest rates 
as of december   we had million in debt outstanding under the bank loan 
at this debt level  a change in market interest rates eg from to would change our annual interest expense by million 
as of december   we had million in debt outstanding under the bank loan 
at that debt level  the change in market interest rates would have changed interest expense by million 
during march  we reduced our debt under the bank loan to million 
at that debt level  a change in market interest rates would change our annual interest expense  equity risk our portfolio of marketable equity securities is subject to equity price risk due to market changes 
the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  if the market price of all marketable equity securities were to change by as of these dates  the fair value of our equity portfolio would have changed  as of december  and million as of december credit risk see reinsurance ceded section contained in item  business  and footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements
