the local communications  wireless and other communications segments are discussed on an as reported basis since there is no distinction between pro forma and as reported results with respect to these segments 
broadband the broadband segment utilizes its advanced optical network consisting of more than  route miles to provide broadband transport  internet services and switched long distance 
the broadband segment also offers data collocation  information technology consulting  network construction and other services 
this segment also provides network capacity and fibers in the form of iru agreements 
these services are offered nationally by the company s broadwing communications subsidiary 
broadband transport services are comprised of the lease of dedicated circuits that customers use to transmit data and voice traffic 
these services are sold on a circuit lease and indefeasible right to use basis 
switched services represent the transmission of long distance switched traffic to retail business customers and resellers 
data and internet services include providing atm frame relay  data collocation and web hosting 
other services are comprised of information technology consulting and network construction services  and  in  residual revenues from a prior sale of dark fiber 
the broadband segment reflects the results of broadwing communications  which became a subsidiary of the company on november  as a result of the merger 
the operations of broadwing communications are included in the company s financial results prospectively from november  for purposes of comparability  the following discussion assumes the broadband segment existed in its current form effective january  and refers to pro forma results 
as a result  the numbers referred to in this discussion will be different from broadband segment amounts included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income loss 
the pro forma numbers also include the revenues and expenses associated with broadwing it consulting and an agreement with cincinnati bell long distance to service its customers outside of the cincinnati  ohio area

the company is fulfilling demand for these services through the construction of new data centers in the current year  bringing the number of fully operational data centers maintained by the broadband segment to ten nationwide 
other revenues more than tripled in the current year  increasing from million in to more than million in the current year 
the majority of this million increase is attributable to the growth of the broadwing it consulting division  which contributed million in additional consulting revenues and related equipment sales 
the remainder of the increase in this category  or approximately million  was the result of network construction projects undertaken on behalf of touch america inc and el paso energy communications company  somewhat offset by nonrecurring  residual revenues from a prior sale of dark fiber 
costs and expenses costs of providing services and products sold consist primarily of access charges paid to local exchange carriers  transmission lease payments to other carriers  costs incurred for network construction projects and personnel and hardware costs in the information technology consulting arena 
in  costs of providing services and products sold amounted to million  a increase over the prior year 
these increases were driven primarily by revenue growth  but were held to a minimum due to a decreased reliance on transmission and access charges from other carriers as the company continues to expand and groom its own nationwide optical network 
these costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in  dropping four points to approximately of revenue 
future costs of providing services and products sold is expected to continue to grow as a function of revenue  but decline somewhat as a percentage of revenue as more of the traffic is carried on the company s network 
gross profit margin continues to improve  increasing four margin points to more than 
the broadband segment s gross profit margin would have experienced a larger increase were it not for growth in lower margin services such as network construction 
the company views network construction services as an important revenue source because it typically gains access to rights of way or additional fiber routes through its network construction activities 
sg a expenses were higher in the current year  increasing  or million  to million 
this was primarily due to the addition of more than employees in support of new products and services and the information technology consulting business

costs and expenses costs and expenses of million excluding depreciation  amortization and special charges were million  or greater than the prior year 
costs of providing services and products sold increased by over million  or  as lower access costs were offset by higher transmission  internet expenses and material costs associated with the growth of broadwing it consulting 
the reduction in access costs was a direct result of broadwing communications making greater utilization of its fiber optic network as well as the reduction in minutes of use caused by the decision to de emphasize the switched wholesale business 
gross margin was in and sg a expenses increased by million  or in comparison to the prior year 
this increase was due in part to additional staffing required to support  sell and market the expanded fiber optic network

recently issued accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
in sab  the sec staff expressed its views regarding the appropriate recognition of revenue with respect to a variety of circumstances  some of which are of particular relevance to the company 
as required  the company adopted sab effective january  and modified its revenue recognition policies with respect to initial service activation fees 
following the guidance in sab  the company is now recognizing service activation revenues and associated direct incremental costs over their respective service lives 
the adoption of this accounting change resulted in a one time  non cash  after tax charge of million  which had virtually no effect on earnings per share in the current year

in  the company recognized million in additional revenues and million in incremental direct expenses pertaining to amounts included in the cumulative effect adjustment for sab as of december  offsetting these amounts were million in current year revenues and million in incremental direct expenses that are being deferred to future periods in accordance with sab this deferral process has virtually no effect on the company s ebitda or net income in the current year 
the company restated the first  second and third quarter operating results to reflect the adoption of sab as of january  see note of the notes to financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that a derivative instrument may need to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  measured at its fair value

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
to manage its exposure to interest rate changes  the company uses a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financial instruments 
the company may  from time to time  employ a small number of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company is  however  required by terms negotiated with its lenders to engage in interest rate swaps once certain thresholds are exceeded with regard to floating rate debt as a percentage of the company s total debt 
the company exceeded this threshold during and  accordingly  entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million 
the purpose of these agreements is to hedge against changes in market interest rates to be charged on the company s borrowings against the credit facility 
these swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because these amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the result of the swap s notional amount and the fixed and floating rate percentages to be charged on the swap 
interest rate differentials associated with the company s interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to interest payable or receivable with the offset to interest expense over the life of the swap 
potential non performance by counter parties to the swap agreements exposes the company to a certain amount of credit risk due to the possibility of counter party default 
because the company s only counter parties in these transactions are financial institutions who are at least investment grade  it believes the risk of counter party default is minimal 
interest rate risk management the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the following table sets forth the face amounts  maturity dates and average interest rates for the fixed and floating rate debt held by the company at december  excluding the psinet forward sale and capital leases in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt floating rate debt average interest rate on    floating rate debt
