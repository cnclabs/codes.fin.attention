item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain areas of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
historically  teradyne recognized revenue from the sales of products upon shipment  provided that risk of loss had passed to the customer  and accrued for the costs of installation 
under the new accounting method adopted retroactive to january   teradyne recognizes revenue from the sales of products when both title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
teradyne also defers the greater of the fair value or the contractual holdback of any undelivered elements  such as installation services  until the undelivered elements are delivered 
teradyne previously accounted for contractual acceptance terms based upon probable achievement of meeting the acceptance criteria 
teradyne now accounts for acceptance terms based upon whether such contractual acceptance criteria is objectively demonstrated prior to shipment 
during the fourth quarter of  teradyne implemented the sec s sab guidelines  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
this was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  the net impact for fiscal year of the adoption of sab on sales  including the amounts deferred at december  which previously would have been recognized prior to sab  was not material 
the results for the first three quarters of fiscal year ending december  have been restated in accordance with sab pro forma amounts for the periods beginning before january  have not been presented as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not be reasonably determined 
selected relationships within the consolidated statements of income years ended december  dollars in thousands net sales    income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle    increase in net sales from preceding year amount    percentage increase decrease in income from preceding year    percentage of net sales net sales expenses cost of sales engineering and development selling and administrative net interest and other income income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income results of operations compared to sales increased in to a record  million from  million in semiconductor test systems shipments increased by due to increased sales to semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors as these customers increased capacity to meet their customer s requirements 
sales of connection systems to unaffiliated customers grew as a result of significant growth in demand from networking  data storage  and other high technology customers 
other test and inspection systems sales increased from with increases in circuit board test and inspection systems of  broadband test systems of  and software test systems of 
due to the sale of a majority interest in the software test business in december  software test systems revenue will not be reflected on an on going basis 
as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results  our business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide 
we are further affected by the cyclical nature of the electronics and semiconductor industry with recurring periods of over supply 
these factors have resulted in a downturn in the demand for our products 
teradyne does not have visibility as to the length or severity of the downturn 
during this period we expect a decline in orders and are anticipating a reduction in sales from the fourth quarter level 
consequently  teradyne is taking appropriate actions to bring expenses in line with the economic conditions 
income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased million from million in to million in semiconductor test systems  connection systems  and other test and inspection systems income before income taxes increased million  million  and million  respectively in due to increased sales in each group 
incoming orders increased from  million in to a record  million in orders increased in all operating segments and were led by a increase in connection systems orders 
semiconductor test systems orders increased 
broadband test systems orders increased and circuit board test and inspection systems and software test systems increased and  respectively 
teradyne s backlog increased to a record  million 
costs of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from of sales in to of sales in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the increased utilization of teradyne s manufacturing overhead as sales volume increased while certain components of cost of sales remained fixed 
engineering and development expenses decreased from of sales in to of sales in  even though spending increased million 
the increase in spending was primarily due to new product development expenses in semiconductor test systems  and  to a lesser extent  increased expenses related to product development in connection systems  circuit board test and inspection systems  and software test systems 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in spending increased by million year over year in support of increased semiconductor test systems  connection systems  and software test systems sales 
interest and other income increased million to million in compared to interest income increased due to an increase in teradyne s average invested balances and higher interest rates 
included in interest and other income is a gain relating to the divestiture of the software test business 
expenses related to the divestiture are included in selling and administrative expense 
these elements offset and the transaction results in an immaterial impact to the financial statements 
teradyne s effective tax rate was in and teradyne continued to utilize export sales corporation benefits and other tax benefits to operate below the us statutory rate of 
compared to sales increased in to  million from  million in semiconductor test systems shipments increased by due to increased orders resulting from capacity expansion at semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors 
sales of connection systems to unaffiliated customers grew as a result of continued growth in demand from networking  data storage  and other high technology customers 
other test and inspection systems sales were down from with decreases in broadband test systems of and circuit board test and inspection systems of 
these decreases were a result of telecommunication customers reducing investment in traditional voice testing technology and circuit board test and inspection systems customers seeking lower cost solutions and or new solutions to test increasingly complex circuit boards 
other test and inspection systems sales decreases were offset slightly by an increase of in sales of software test systems to customers within the telecommunication and web based application development markets 
net income grew million to million in from million in income before income taxes increased million from million in to million in semiconductor test systems and connection systems income before income taxes increased million and million  respectively in due to increased sales 
other test and inspection systems income before income taxes decreased million in resulting in a loss before income taxes of million in this decrease in income before income taxes was due to decreased sales coupled with teradyne maintaining its engineering and development of new products 
incoming orders increased from  million in to a record  million in orders increased in nearly all operating segments and were led by a increase in semiconductor test systems orders 
connection systems and software test systems orders both increased and circuit board test and inspection systems orders increased by a modest 
orders for broadband test systems decreased in as a result of record bookings  teradyne s backlog increased to a record million 
costs of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from of sales in to of sales in included in cost of sales in was a million charge for excess inventory 
the charge resulted from the drop in demand for semiconductor test systems products 
excluding this charge  cost of sales decreased from to 
the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the increased utilization of teradyne s manufacturing overhead as sales volume increased while certain components of cost of sales remained fixed 
engineering and development expenses were of sales in both and representing a year over year increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to new product development expenses in semiconductor test systems although there were increased expenses related to product development in each of teradyne s operating segments 
selling and administrative expenses were of sales in both and representing a year over year increase of million 
the increase was due to higher compensation related expenses and spending in support of increased semiconductor test systems 
interest income increased million to million in compared to due to an increase in teradyne s average invested balances 
teradyne s effective tax rate was in and teradyne utilized export sales corporation benefits and certain research and development tax credits to operate below the us statutory rate of 
liquidity and capital resources teradyne s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased million in  to million 
teradyne has generated cash from operating activities in each of the last three years and has used that cash to fund operations 
net income  adjusted to exclude the effects of non cash items  provided cash of million in  million in  and million accounts receivable increased in primarily as a result of increased shipment volume in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventories increased in to support teradyne s backlog commitment 
these increases were partially offset by an increase of in accounts payable and other accruals 
in total  other than those assets and liabilities resulting from investing and financing activities the cash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities was a million use in  a million source in  and a million source in teradyne used million of cash for investing activities in  million in  and million in investing activities consist of purchases  sales  and maturities of marketable securities and purchases of capital assets to support long term growth 
capital expenditures increased by million in compared with primarily in semiconductor test systems and connection systems segments 
this was due to capacity expansion in land  buildings and improvements  and machinery and equipment 
capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in teradyne used million of cash for financing activities in  million in  and million in financing activities include sales and repurchases of teradyne s common stock  as well as repayments of debt 
during   and net common stock activity used million  million  and million of cash  respectively 
since  teradyne has used million of cash to repurchase million shares of its common stock on the open market 
teradyne s available revolving credit line of million expired on january  at expiration of the revolver  any amounts outstanding are converted into a two year term note 
as of december  and  no amounts were outstanding under this agreement 
the revolving credit line was not renewed in teradyne believes its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance of million  together with other sources of funds  including cash flow generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which was issued in june and was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
defers the effective date of sfas no 
to the first quarter of all fiscal years beginning after june  teradyne will implement sfas no 
 as amended in and does not expect any material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts  and accounts receivable 
teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities  rated aa or higher  which have minimal credit risk 
teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
exchange rate risk management teradyne regularly enters into forward contracts in european and japanese currencies to hedge its overseas net monetary position and firm commitments 
teradyne s firm commitments consist of certain orders received in currencies other than us dollars 
forward currency contracts generally have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 
at december  the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy us dollars for non us currencies was million 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since these contracts hedge non us currency transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by opposite changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
the hypothetical movement was estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward currency contracts at december  and comparing that with those calculated using hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk management due to its short term duration the fair value of teradyne s cash and investment portfolio at december  approximated carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for issues contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by teradyne  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k and teradyne s annual report to shareholders may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in item business relating to teradyne s delivery time of unfilled orders  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and planned capital expenditures  may be forward looking statements 
teradyne s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in teradyne s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our business is impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide 
our business is dependent on current and anticipated market demand for electronics  which has been impacted by the slowdown in the economies of the united states  asia  and elsewhere that began in the latter portions of while our diverse businesses may allow us to perform better than some companies in periods of economic decline  there is no guarantee that this will be the case currently 
our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics 
our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products 
the electronic and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe effect on demand for test equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by us 
we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
we are dependent on the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could impact our results of operations 
we cannot assure that any future increase in sales or bookings for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the electronic industry or particular segments within the electronic industry may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have taken and expect to continue to take remedial measures to address the recent slowdown in the market for our products which could have long term effects on our business 
we have taken and expect to continue to take remedial measures to address the recent slowdown in the market for our products 
in particular  we have reduced our workforce  frozen hiring  delayed salary increases  reduced senior managers pay  implemented furloughs  and reduced our planned capital expenditures and expense budgets 
these measures will reduce our expenses in the face of decreased revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders 
however  each of these measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  and making it more difficult for us to respond to customers 
if we are not able to meet our customers delivery requirements  it would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we typically maintain a large multi week order backlog 
if we are unable to fill these orders and meet customer delivery expectations  customers may cancel existing orders or fail to place new orders in the future  which would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
factors that affect our ability to meet customer delivery expectations include the availability of expanded manufacturing facilities  our ability to attract and retain qualified manufacturing personnel to meet anticipated manufacturing levels  the difficulties inherent in manufacturing highly complex products that have only recently been introduced  and the availability of components  including semiconductor chips  which may be in short supply from time to time 
in addition  we rely upon third party contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products  and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors  over whom we do not exercise any control 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
our products incorporate technology that we protect in several ways  including patents  copyrights  and trade secrets 
while we believe that our patents  copyrights  and trade secrets have value  in general no single one is in itself essential 
at times we have been notified that we may be in violation of patents held by others 
an assertion of patent infringement against us  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products  or could require a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results 
if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products  it will adversely affect our revenues 
we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers 
our development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products  and market acceptance and customer demand for those products is critical to our success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  and timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
intense competition in our industry may affect our revenues 
we face substantial competition  throughout the world  in each of our operating segments 
some of these competitors also have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers 
some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks of operating internationally 
we derive a significant portion of our total revenue from customers outside the united states 
our international sales are subject to significant risks and difficulties  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting our markets  changes in tariffs and exchange rates  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing of customer orders and the deferral or cancellation of orders previously received  changes in product mix  our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  market acceptance of our and our competitors products  fulfilling backlog on a timely basis  reliance on sole source suppliers  potential retrofit costs  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  and the timing of investments in engineering and development 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and stock price
