important factors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from our forward looking statements  as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals  include  but are not limited to  the following the lack of continued availability of sufficient working capital 
our inability to integrate new stores into existing operations 
the decline in continued desirability and customer acceptance of our existing and future products 
possible cancellation of wholesale orders 
the success of our competitive products 
our inability to strengthen our inventory cost accounting controls and procedures 
our inability to identify and respond appropriately to changing consumer demands and fashion trends 
a decision by the controlling owner of a group of department stores or any other significant customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying guess products 
our inability to control the quality  focus  image  financial stability or distribution of our licensed products  which could impact consumer receptivity to our products 
our failure to continue to enhance operating control systems 
the outcomes of pending and future litigation 
factors beyond our control  such as which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our network of retail stores 
our general failure to maintain and control our existing distribution and licensing arrangements or to procure additional distribution and licensing relationships 
changes in the economy 
the extended loss of the services of one or more of our principal executive officers 
political instability resulting in the disruption of trade with the countries in which our contractors  suppliers or customers are located  the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports  the imposition of additional duties  taxes and other charges on imports  significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds 
also  a substantial increase in customs duties  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
these factors may be exacerbated by our increasing use of packaged purchase sourcing from non united states vendors 
the inability of a manufacturer to ship our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards 
no assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in  or ownership of  trademarks and other proprietary rights of guess 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
seasonality our business is impacted by general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries 
our retail operations are generally stronger in the third and fourth quarters  while our wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance in the first and third quarters 
as the timing of the shipment of products may vary from year to year  the result for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
we have not had significant overhead and other costs generally associated with large seasonal variations 
inflation we do not believe the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on our net revenue or profitability 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our net revenue or profitability 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas was issued and subsequently amended by sfas sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial reporting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we receive united states dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our licensing revenues 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future 
in addition  royalties received from our international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to us in united states dollars 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our inventory costs 
we may enter into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  to manage foreign exchange risk on foreign currency transactions 
these financial instruments can be used to protect us from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
unrealized gains and losses on outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts  used to hedge future revenues and purchases  are not recorded in the financial statements but are included in the measurement of the related hedged transaction when realized 
the company will adopt sfas effective january  this could impact the company s accounting of derivatives 
forward exchange us dollar fair value in us contracts equivalent maturity date at december  canadian dollars  december  to january   canadian dollars  january  to january   canadian dollars  january  to february   canadian dollars  february  to february   based upon the rates at december   the cost to buy the equivalent us dollars discussed above was approximately million canadian currency 
at december   of the company s indebtedness contained a fixed interest rate of 
substantially all of the company s remaining indebtedness  including borrowings under its million credit facility is at variable rates of interest 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s results of operations in future periods 
a change in interest rate is not expected to significantly impact the company s operating results
