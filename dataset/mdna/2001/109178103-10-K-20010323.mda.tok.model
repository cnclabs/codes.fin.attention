item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview brigham is an independent exploration and production company that applies d seismic imaging and other advanced technologies to systematically explore and develop onshore oil and natural gas provinces in the united states 
from inception in through december   brigham acquired  square miles of d seismic data and drilled wells delineated by d seismic analysis 
through its d seismic based drilling efforts  brigham has discovered an aggregate of bcfe of net proved reserves as of december   at an average net drilling cost of per mcfe 
combining its geologic and geophysical expertise with a sophisticated land effort  brigham manages the majority of its projects from conception through d acquisition  processing and interpretation and leasing 
in addition  brigham manages the negotiation and drafting of most of its geophysical exploration agreements  resulting in reduced contract risk and more consistent deal terms 
because it generates most of its projects  brigham can often control the size of the working interest that it retains as well as the selection of the operator and the non operating participants 
consistent with its business strategy  brigham has increased the working interest it retained in its projects  based on capital availability and perceived risk 
brigham s average working interest in its d seismic projects acquired during  and was  and  respectively  while its average working interest in its wells drilled during this period was  and  respectively 
brigham did not acquire any new d seismic in and  and its average working interest in its wells drilled during these periods was and  respectively 
beginning in  brigham has managed operations through the drilling and production phases on an increasing portion of its d seismic projects 
brigham operated of its gross wells and of its net wells drilled in as compared with of its gross wells and of its net wells drilled in expenditures made in oil and natural gas exploration vary from project to project depending primarily on the costs related to seismic acquisition  land and drilling  and the working interest retained by brigham 
prior to  brigham s participants typically bore a disproportionate share of the costs of optioning available acreage and acquiring  processing and interpreting the d seismic data  and brigham and its participants each typically incurred leasing  drilling and completion costs in proportion to their ownership interests 
in and  brigham retained majority working interests in its new d seismic projects  and thereby reduced the financial leverage it historically received on the costs of optioning available acreage and acquiring  processing and interpreting the d seismic data on its projects 
from inception through  brigham acquired  gross net square miles of d seismic data 
initially  brigham focused its exploration efforts in west texas 
since  brigham has devoted the majority of its resources to the anadarko basin and gulf coast 
with this shift in regional focus  the majority of brigham s production volumes have shifted from oil to natural gas 
to finance these project generation and drilling activities  brigham supplemented cash flow from operations with private placements of debt and equity  commercial bank credit facilities and placements of working interests in projects with industry participants 
as brigham s cash flows from operations and other sources of capital have increased during this period  it retained larger average working interests in its projects 
in and  brigham acquired  gross  net square miles of d seismic and continued to focus the majority of its d exploration efforts in the anadarko basin and the gulf coast 
during these two years  brigham acquired  square miles of d seismic in the anadarko basin  making this basin its most active d seismic acquisition province 
brigham also significantly increased its gulf coast activity  acquiring square miles of d seismic during this period 
during and  brigham drilled gross net wells based on its d seismic data analysis 
in addition to its drilling activities  brigham acquired net bcfe of proved reserves and an interest in undeveloped acreage the chitwood acquisition at the northern end of the carter knox anticline in grady county  oklahoma for million in november as a result of these activities  brigham s net oil and natural gas production increased from bcfe in to bcfe in brigham s net production volumes consisted of natural gas on an equivalent basis during the fourth quarter as compared with during the fourth quarter brigham supplemented cash flow from operations in and with borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities  million raised in its initial public offering of common stock in may  million raised through the placement of debt and equity securities in august and the placement of working interests in projects to industry participants to finance its project generation  property acquisition and drilling activities 
brigham implemented a number of strategic initiatives during and to generate capital resources to fund its continuing exploration program while reducing its level of indebtedness 
these objectives and results accomplished for each include o focusing all planned exploration efforts to the drilling of highest grade d prospects in its anadarko basin and gulf coast projects 
during and  brigham directed the vast majority of its resources to the drilling of identified prospects within natural gas trends where it had achieved historical drilling success 
in addition  brigham s drilling program during this time period consisted of a more balanced mix of exploration and development drilling projects as compared with prior drilling activity that was predominately exploratory in nature 
this focused drilling emphasis contributed to substantially improved returns on brigham s drilling investments during and  with average drilling costs of per mcfe and average all in finding costs of per mcfe in this two year period 
o eliminating substantially all seismic and land expenditures for new projects 
in an effort to devote the majority of its capital resources to the drilling of its identified prospect locations  brigham did not acquire any new d seismic data in and in addition to executing a high graded drilling program  brigham s staff of explorationists continued to interpret previously acquired d seismic data within existing projects to further delineate and refine pre drill analysis of potential drilling locations in its focus project areas 
o divesting certain producing oil and natural gas properties 
in june  brigham sold interests in certain non operated properties in two project areas the chitwood field and the red deer creek field in its anadarko basin province for a total of million 
these properties had estimated net proved reserves of bcfe as of june   of which approximately were non producing  and were producing an estimated net mmcfe per day at the time of the sales 
after application of the net proceeds received from these sales to the repayment of a portion of its outstanding borrowings under its bank credit facility  brigham was able to increase its available borrowings under its bank credit facility by million 
the increase in bank borrowing capacity resulting primarily from these property sales was utilized to fund a substantial portion of brigham s capital expenditures during the second half of o restructuring its senior and subordinated debt agreements 
working closely with its senior and subordinated lenders in and early  brigham was able to amend its senior credit facility and the indenture for its then outstanding subordinated notes due to provide for increased borrowing availability and financial flexibility to preserve cash flow to fund its exploration activities 
during  brigham completed several financing transactions  including the refinancing of its subordinated notes due at a substantial discount  that resulted in lower debt levels while providing funding for its and capital expenditure programs 
see liquidity and capital resources 
o implementing an overhead reduction plan 
brigham implemented several initiatives during that were designed to reduce general and administrative expenses and thereby increase cash flow from operations 
these cost reduction initiatives included a company wide salary reduction effective in may  the elimination of employee bonuses for  subleasing a portion of brigham s office space  certain personnel reductions and the elimination or reduction of various other discretionary expenses 
as a result of these actions  brigham s total general and administrative expenses including amounts capitalized were reduced from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter  while per unit net general and administrative expenses decreased from per mcfe to per mcfe during these same periods 
brigham continued its focus on minimizing discretionary overhead expenses during these continuing efforts resulted in a reduction in total general and administrative expenses including amounts capitalized in as compared with  while per unit net general and administrative expenses were further reduced by from per mcfe to per mcfe during these same periods 
o raising equity capital 
during and  brigham raised in excess of million through the sale of interests in non producing assets  primarily project and prospect equity sales to industry participants 
in addition  brigham issued million of common stock to veritas dgc land  inc veritas to satisfy payment obligations due to veritas for seismic acquisition and processing services performed prior to and certain seismic processing services performed during in connection with its series of financing transactions effected in to fund its exploration and development program and to refinance its subordinated notes due  brigham raised million through private placements of common and preferred stock 
see liquidity and capital resources 
brigham uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including payroll  interest  and other internal costs  incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
internal costs capitalized are directly attributable to acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied to reduce the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties unless the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized cost and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
to the extent that the costs capitalized in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate and based on period end oil and natural gas prices of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the capitalized cost of unproved properties  such costs are charged to operations as a writedown of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  or a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
the risk that brigham will be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed  even if such prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if brigham experiences poor drilling results or has substantial downward revisions in its estimated proved reserves 
a capitalized ceiling impairment is a charge to earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and stockholders equity 
once incurred  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
primarily as a result of the significant declines in both oil and natural gas prices at december  and disappointing drilling results on several high working interest wells in  brigham recorded a capitalized ceiling impairment charge at december  of million 
no assurance can be given that brigham will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods 
see risk factors exploratory drilling is a speculative activity involving numerous risks and uncertain costs  we are dependent on exploratory drilling activities  risk factors volatility of oil and gas markets affects us  oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and risk factors we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters derivative instruments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales increased from million in to million in an increase in the average equivalent sales price received for oil and natural gas sales accounted for million of this increase and the remaining  of this increase was the result of higher net equivalent production volumes 
natural gas production volumes increased from  mmcf in to  mmcf in  while the average price received for natural gas decreased from per mcf in to per mcf in natural gas production volumes during included mmcf attributable to properties sold by brigham in june excluding production attributable to these divested properties  natural gas production volumes increased in as compared with adjusted production volumes in oil production volumes increased from mbbls in to mbbls in  while the average price received for oil increased from per bbl in to per bbl in oil production volumes during included mbbls attributable to properties sold by brigham in june excluding production attributable to these divested properties  oil production volumes increased in as compared with adjusted production volumes in oil and natural gas sales in were increased by higher realized equivalent oil and natural gas prices and production from wells completed during  offset partially by the natural decline of existing production and losses from oil and natural gas hedges 
see overview 
as a result of hedging activities  natural gas revenues were reduced by million per mcf in  compared to a decrease in natural gas revenues of  per mcf in oil revenues were reduced by  per bbl due to hedging losses in there were no gains or losses on crude oil hedges during see other matters derivative instruments 
workstation revenue 
workstation revenue decreased from  in to  in brigham recognizes workstation revenue as industry participants in its seismic programs are charged an hourly rate for the work brigham performs on its d seismic interpretation workstations 
this decrease in is primarily attributable a reduction in the volume of d seismic interpretation activity billable to industry participants as compared with lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses decreased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of producing wells in as compared with that was attributable to brigham s june property divestitures and the plugging and abandonment of certain uneconomic wells 
see overview 
production taxes 
production taxes increased from  per mcfe in to million per mcfe in primarily due to higher average oil and natural gas sales prices and revenues before the effects of hedging gains or losses 
the effective average production tax rate decreased from of pre hedge oil and natural gas sales in to in resulting primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of brigham s producing wells 
general and administrative expenses 
net general and administrative expenses decreased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction of various administrative costs  including lower office rent due to the subleasing of a portion of brigham s headquarters space  reduced equipment rental and maintenance expenses  and lower employee payroll and benefits expenses 
see overview 
depletion of oil and natural gas properties 
depletion of oil and natural gas properties increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in of this increase   was attributable to higher production volumes  partially offset by  due to the reduction in the depletion rate per unit of production 
the decrease in depletion rate per unit of production was primarily the result of the addition of oil and natural gas reserves at lower average capital costs due to improved average finding costs during interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher effective interest rates that were partly offset by lower outstanding debt balances 
brigham s weighted average outstanding debt balance decreased from million in to million in this reduction in debt was primarily attributable to brigham s refinancing of its senior subordinated notes due in november the effective annual interest rate on brigham s outstanding indebtedness increased slightly from in to in in addition  interest expense in included i million of interest expenses that were paid in kind through the issuance of additional debt in lieu of cash  and ii million of non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred loan fees and the amortization of discount on senior subordinated notes 
borrowings under brigham s senior credit facility had an effective annual interest rate of at december  in november  brigham refinanced its senior subordinated notes due at a substantial discount to the principal amount then outstanding 
this refinancing reduced brigham s outstanding debt borrowings and is expected to result in lower average interest rates during see liquidity and capital resources refinancing transactions 
other expense 
other expense increased from  in to million in brigham recognizes other income or expense primarily related to the changes in the fair market values and the related cash flows of certain oil and natural gas derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
other expense in included i  of non cash expenses related to the changes in the fair market values of these derivative contracts during the period  and ii  of expenses related to cash settlements incurred during the period pursuant to these derivative contracts 
other expense in included i million of non cash expenses related to the changes in the fair market values of these derivative contracts during the period  and ii  of expenses related to cash settlements incurred during the period pursuant to these derivative contracts 
extraordinary gain on refinancing of senior subordinated notes 
in november  brigham repurchased all of the debt and equity securities in brigham held by affiliates of enron north america the enron affiliates at a substantial discount 
with a portion of the proceeds from two new financing transactions  brigham repurchased all of the enron affiliates interests in brigham  which included i million of senior subordinated notes due which bore interest at annual rates of to and associated accrued interest obligations  ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of one million shares of common stock at per share  and iii  shares of common stock collectively  the enron securities  for total cash consideration of million 
as a result of the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes due at a discount to the principal amount outstanding  brigham recorded an extraordinary gain of million in the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales increased from million in to million in an increase in the average sales price received for oil and natural gas sales accounted for million of this increase and was offset by  from a decrease in net production volumes 
production volumes for natural gas decreased from  mmcf in to  mmcf in  while the average price received for natural gas increased from per mcf in to per mcf in production volumes for oil decreased from mbbls in to mbbls in  while the average price received for oil increased from per bbl in to per bbl in oil and natural gas sales in were increased by higher realized oil and natural gas prices and production from wells completed during  offset partially by the natural decline of existing production and from the sale of certain producing wells in the company s mid property divestitures 
see overview 
as a result of hedging activities  natural gas revenues were reduced by  per mcf in  compared to an increase in natural gas revenues of  per mcf in see other matters derivative instruments 
workstation revenue 
workstation revenue decreased from  in to  in this decrease is primarily attributable to brigham s increased working interests in its d seismic projects in and  which reduced the amount of workstation interpretation costs billable to brigham s project participants 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase was primarily due to higher average working interests in its producing wells and increased well repair and workover activity in as compared with  offset in part by the elimination of lease operating expenses related to wells sold by brigham in its mid property divestitures 
see overview 
production taxes 
production taxes increased from  per mcfe in to  per mcfe in primarily due to higher average oil and natural gas sales prices and revenues 
the effective average production tax rate increased from of oil and natural gas sales revenues in to in resulting from changes in the geographic distribution of brigham s producing wells 
general and administrative expenses 
net general and administrative expenses decreased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this decrease was primarily attributable to a series of cost reduction initiatives implemented by brigham during to reduce overhead expense levels 
these initiatives included a company wide salary reduction effective in may  the elimination of employee bonuses for  a sublease of a portion of brigham s headquarters space effective in november  certain personnel reductions and the elimination or reduction of various other discretionary expenses 
depletion of oil and natural gas properties 
depletion of oil and natural gas properties decreased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in of this decrease   was attributable to the lower production volumes during the period and  was due to the reduction in the depletion rate per unit of production 
the decrease in depletion rate per unit of production was primarily the result of the addition of oil and natural gas reserves at lower average capital costs due to improved average finding costs during  partially offset by an increase in the percentage of brigham s total full cost pool subject to depletion attributable to an increase in the estimate of the evaluated portion of brigham s oil and natural gas properties 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to higher outstanding debt balances in at higher effective interest rates 
brigham s weighted average outstanding debt balance increased from million in to million in this increase in debt was incurred primarily to fund brigham s increased capital expenditures and working capital needs  net of operating cash flow  during and the effective annual interest rate on brigham s outstanding indebtedness increased from in to in  primarily due to brigham s issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due in august  which bore interest at an annual rate of when paid in cash and when paid in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes 
in addition  interest expense in included i million of interest expenses related to the subordinated notes due that was paid in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes in lieu of cash  and ii million of non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred loan fees and the amortization of discount on the subordinated notes 
borrowings under brigham s senior credit facility had an effective annual interest rate of at december  see liquidity and capital resources 
loss on sale of oil and natural gas properties 
in june  brigham sold all of its interests in certain producing and non producing oil and natural gas properties for a total sales price of million 
due to the magnitude of the reserve volumes that were attributable to these properties relative to brigham s remaining net reserve volumes  brigham recognized a million non cash loss to reflect the difference between the sales price received after adjustment for transaction costs and the million basis allocated to the divested properties in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
no property divestitures occurred during for which recognition of gain or loss was appropriate 
liquidity and capital resources brigham s primary sources of capital have been credit facility and other debt borrowings  public and private equity financings  the sale of interests in projects and properties and funds generated by operations 
brigham s primary capital requirements are d seismic acquisition  processing and interpretation costs  land acquisition costs and drilling expenditures 
credit facility in january  brigham entered into a revolving credit agreement as amended  the senior credit facility  which provided for an initial borrowing availability of million 
the senior credit facility was amended in march to reduce the borrowing availability  extend the date of borrowing base redetermination  modify certain financial covenants  include certain additional covenants that place restrictions on brigham s ability to incur certain capital expenditures  and to increase the interest rate on outstanding borrowings 
as a result of the completion of the majority of brigham s strategic initiatives to improve its capital resources  including its june property divestitures and the application of the net sales proceeds to reduce borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility  brigham and its senior lenders entered into an amendment to the senior credit facility in july this amendment provided brigham with borrowing availability of million 
as consideration for this amendment  in july brigham issued to its senior lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of brigham common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants have a seven year term from the date of issuance and are exercisable at the holders option at any time 
an estimated value of million was attributed to these warrants by brigham and was recognized as additional deferred loan fees that will be amortized and included in interest expense over the remaining period to maturity of the senior credit facility 
in february  brigham entered into an amended and restated senior credit facility with its existing senior lenders and a new senior lender 
the senior credit facility was further amended in october the amended and restated senior credit facility provides brigham with million in borrowing availability for a three year term 
as a result of the february amendments  million of the senior credit facility held by one of the lenders is convertible into shares of brigham common stock the convertible notes in the following amounts and prices i million is convertible at per share  ii million is convertible at per share and iii million is convertible at per share 
as of december   brigham had million in borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility  of which the convertible notes are million 
in connection with brigham s refinancing of its subordinated notes due see subordinated notes and refinancing transactions in october  brigham entered into an amendment to the senior credit facility that  among other things  permitted the issuance of new subordinated notes and new preferred stock to provide funding for the repurchase of the subordinated notes due and equity interests in brigham held by the enron affiliates 
in addition  the minimum interest coverage ratio as defined tests of the senior credit facility were amended to reflect brigham s expected cash flow and interest expense beginning in the fourth quarter of subsequent to the refinancing transactions as defined  and brigham conditionally waived certain rights to force conversion of the portion of the borrowings under the senior credit facility that are convertible at per share 
if the senior credit facility is repaid at maturity or is prepaid prior to maturity without payment of cash premiums  the warrants to purchase brigham common stock issued to the new participant in the senior credit facility become exercisable 
further  to the extent brigham chooses to prepay any of the convertible notes without the warrants becoming exercisable  and also assuming the lender chooses not to convert to equity upon notice of such prepayment  brigham will be required to a pay a premium above the face value of the convertible notes to the lender 
such premium amounts would range from to  depending upon the timing of the prepayment 
such prepayment  however  would require prior approval of the original lenders to the senior credit facility 
in addition  certain financial covenants of the senior credit facility were amended or added in the july  february and october amendments 
in connection with the february amendment  brigham reset the price of the warrants previously issued to its existing senior lenders to purchase one million shares of brigham common stock from the then current exercise price of per share to per share 
principal outstanding under the senior credit facility is due at maturity on december   with interest due monthly for base rate tranches or periodically as libor tranches mature 
the annual interest rate for borrowings under the senior credit facility is either the lender s base rate or libor plus  at brigham s option 
obligations under the senior credit facility are secured by substantially all of brigham s oil and natural gas properties and other tangible assets 
at march   brigham had million in borrowings outstanding under the senior credit facility  which bear interest at an annual rate of approximately 
the senior credit facility has certain financial covenants  including current and interest coverage ratios  as defined 
brigham and its senior lenders effected the amendments to the senior credit facility described above in part to enable brigham to comply with certain financial covenants of the senior credit facility  including the minimum current ratio as defined  minimum interest coverage ratio as defined  and the limitation on capital expenditures related to seismic and land activities 
should brigham be unable to comply with certain of the financial or other covenants  its senior lenders may be unwilling to waive compliance or amend the covenants in the future 
in such instance  brigham s liquidity may be adversely affected  which could in turn have an adverse impact on its future financial position and results of operations 
subordinated notes in august  brigham issued million of debt and equity securities to affiliates of enron corp 
the securities issued by brigham in connection with this financing transaction included i million of subordinated notes due  ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of one million shares of brigham common stock at a price of per share  and iii  shares of brigham common stock at a price of per share

sales of interests in projects and oil and natural gas properties duke project financing 
in february  brigham entered into a project financing arrangement with duke energy financial services  inc duke to fund the continued exploration of five anadarko basin projects covered by approximately square miles of d seismic data acquired in in this transaction  brigham conveyed of its working interest land and seismic in these project areas to a newly formed limited liability company the brigham duke llc for total consideration of million 
brigham entered into this project financing arrangement to enable it to recoup substantially all of its pre seismic land and seismic data acquisition costs incurred in these project areas and to provide the capital to fund the drilling of the first six wells within these projects 
brigham served as the managing member of the brigham duke llc with a interest  and duke was the sole remaining member with a interest 
pursuant to the terms of the brigham duke llc agreement  brigham paid of the drilling and completion costs for all wells drilled by the brigham duke llc within the designated project areas in exchange for a working interest in the wells and their allocable drilling and spacing units  with the remaining working interest remaining in the brigham duke llc  subject in each instance to proportionate reduction by any ownership rights held by third parties 
upon project payout  brigham had the right to back in for of the brigham duke llc s working interest in all of the then producing wells and their allocable drilling and spacing units and a working interest in any wells and their allocable drilling and spacing units drilled after payout within the designated project areas governed by the brigham duke llc agreement  thereby increasing brigham s effective working interest in the brigham duke llc wells from to 
in february  duke  as majority member of the brigham duke llc  elected to dissolve the brigham duke llc 
as a result  any ownership of remaining undeveloped land and or seismic data within the brigham duke llc project areas will be transferred to duke following the dissolution of the brigham duke llc 
mid property sales 
in june  brigham sold certain producing and non producing oil and natural gas properties located in its anadarko basin province to two separate parties for a total of million 
the divested properties were located in two fields operated by third parties the chitwood field in grady county  oklahoma originally acquired by brigham for million in the chitwood acquisition in november  and the red deer creek field in roberts county  texas 
brigham s independent reservoir engineers estimated net proved reserve volumes attributable to the properties as of june  of approximately bcfe  of which were classified as proved developed producing reserves and were natural gas 
brigham estimated that net production volumes from the divested properties were mmcfe per day at the time of the sales 
brigham used the proceeds from these transactions to reduce borrowings under its credit facility  which contributed to provide million in borrowing availability under brigham s then existing credit facility that was used to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures during the second half of the effective date of each transaction was june  equity placements veritas equity issuances 
on march   brigham entered into an agreement with veritas dgc land  inc to exchange  shares of newly issued brigham common stock valued at per share for approximately million of payment obligations due to veritas in for certain seismic acquisition and processing services previously performed 
in addition  this agreement provided for the payment by brigham of up to million in future seismic processing services to be performed by veritas in newly issued shares of brigham common stock valued at per share  in the event that brigham did not elect to pay for such services in cash 
the settlement of these future seismic processing services was determined on a quarterly basis through september  pursuant to this agreement  brigham issued a total of  shares of common stock to veritas to satisfy million in aggregate payment obligations due to veritas for seismic acquisition and processing services performed prior to and certain seismic processing services performed during private placement of common stock

pricing of this private equity placement was based on the average market price of brigham common stock during a twenty trading day period prior to issuance 
net proceeds from this equity placement were used to fund a portion of brigham s capital expenditures and working capital obligations during private placement of preferred stock 
on march   brigham sold million of additional series a preferred stock and warrants the new csfb warrants to affiliates of csfb in a private placement transaction 
the conditions to brigham s receipt of the process from this transaction were fulfilled on march  the new csfb warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of brigham common stock have a term of ten years  an exercise price of per share and must be exercised  if brigham so requires  in the event that brigham common stock trades at an average of at least of the exercise price currently  per share for consecutive trading days 
the exercise price of the new csfb warrants is payable either in cash or in shares of series a preferred stock  valued at liquidation value plus accrued dividends 
if brigham requires exercise of the new csfb warrants  proceeds from the exercise of the new csfb warrants will be used to fund the redemption of a similar value of then outstanding series a preferred stock

capital expenditures continuing its strategy initiated in to harvest its prior d seismic project investments  brigham intends to focus substantially all of its efforts and available capital resources in to the drilling and monetization of its highest grade prospects within its over  square mile inventory of d seismic data 
brigham s planned capital expenditure budget is estimated to be million  which includes approximately million for drilling projects  million for acreage leasing and g g activities  and million for capitalized overhead and interest costs 
brigham s planned drilling program consists of a balanced blend of higher potential exploration tests and lower risk development drilling projects  driven to a large extent by the development of several significant exploratory discoveries completed during approximately of budgeted drilling expenditures are targeted for exploratory prospects  for development locations and the remaining for development locations that are contingent upon drilling success during the year 
in addition  over of brigham s budgeted drilling expenditures are focused in five project areas in the springer and hunton trends of the anadarko basin and the vicksburg and frio trends of the texas gulf coast 
brigham intends to fund its budgeted capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations  available borrowings under its subordinated notes facility and the net proceeds from its private placements of series a preferred stock in november and march additionally  brigham will continue to seek opportunities to supplement its available capital resources through selective sales of interests in non producing assets  including interests in its d seismic projects and promoted interests in future drilling prospects or locations

due to its active exploration and development activities  brigham has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements 
while brigham believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its subordinated notes facility should allow it to finance its planned operations through based on current conditions and expectations  additional financing will be required in the future to fund brigham s exploration and development activities 
in the event additional financing is not available  brigham may be required to curtail or delay its planned activities 
other matters derivative instruments brigham believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows it to reduce its exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby to achieve more predictable cash flows 
however  hedging arrangements  when utilized  may limit the benefit to brigham of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  brigham s hedging arrangements generally do not apply to all of its production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
brigham expects that the amount of its hedges will vary from time to time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in  brigham began using natural gas swap arrangements in an attempt to reduce its sensitivity to volatile commodity prices as its production base became increasingly weighted toward natural gas 
pursuant to these arrangements  brigham exchanges a floating market price for a fixed contract price 
brigham makes payments when the floating price exceeds the fixed price for a contract month  and brigham receives payments when the fixed price exceeds the floating price 
settlements of these swaps are based on the difference between regional market index prices for a contract month and the fixed contract price for the same month 
total natural gas purchased and sold subject to swap arrangements entered into by brigham was  mmbtu in   mmbtu in  and  mmbtu in brigham accounted for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  adjusted the price received for oil and natural gas production during the period the hedged transactions occurred 
adjustments to the price received for natural gas under these swap arrangements resulted in an increase in natural gas revenues of  in and decreases in natural gas revenues of  in and million in in addition  brigham s oil revenues were reduced by  in as a result of its crude oil collar hedging arrangements outstanding during the year 
brigham did not have any outstanding crude oil hedging contracts during and in september  brigham sold call options on a portion of its future oil and natural gas production 
brigham applied the proceeds from the sale of these call options to increase the effective fixed swap price on its then existing natural gas hedging contracts during the months of october through january by an average of per mmbtu 
for accounting purposes  the improvement in brigham s fixed natural gas swap price attributable to these transactions was not reflected in reported revenues 
rather  it was reflected in i other income expense on the income statement  and ii amortization of deferred loss on derivatives instruments and market value adjustment for derivatives instruments on the cash flow statement

if the price of oil and natural gas increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in revenues as well as the operating costs that brigham is required to bear for operations 
inflation has had a minimal effect on brigham 
environmental and other regulatory matters brigham s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production and marketing of oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although brigham believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and brigham is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect brigham s financial condition and operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to brigham  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of brigham

all derivative instruments will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
brigham s derivative contracts consist primarily of cash flow hedge transactions in which brigham is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments will be reported in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current period earnings 
in january  brigham recorded a net of tax cumulative effect adjustment of million to other comprehensive income to recognize the fair value liability of all derivative instruments which qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with fas forward looking information brigham or its representatives may make forward looking statements  oral or written  including statements in this report  press releases and filings with the sec  regarding estimated future net revenues from oil and natural gas reserves and the present value thereof  planned capital expenditures including the amount and nature thereof  increases in oil and gas production  the number of wells it anticipates drilling during and brigham s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although brigham believes that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by brigham will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that they will have the expected effects on its business or operations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from brigham s expectations are general economic conditions  inherent uncertainties in interpreting engineering data  operating hazards  delays or cancellations of drilling operations for a variety of reasons  competition  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  availability of sufficient capital resources to brigham and its project participants  government regulations and other factors set forth among the risk factors noted below or in the description of brigham s business in item of this report 
all subsequent oral and written forward looking statements attributable to brigham or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors

risk factors we are substantially leveraged our outstanding long term debt was million as of december   and million as of march  the credit agreements related to our senior credit facility and subordinated notes facility limit the amount of additional debt borrowings  including borrowings under these facilities or other senior or subordinated indebtedness 
as of march   we had no additional borrowing availability under our senior credit facility and million in additional permitted borrowing availability under our subordinated notes facility 
in addition  brigham held as cash million in net proceeds from the march private placement of series a preferred stock 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our operations  including those listed below 
o we will dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and to the payment of our other current obligations  and will not have these cash flows available for other purposes 
o the covenants in our credit facilities limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions 
o our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
we may also be required to alter our capitalization significantly to accommodate future exploration  development or acquisition activities 
these changes in capitalization may significantly alter our leverage and dilute the equity interests of existing stockholders 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our future performance will not be harmed by such economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we have substantial capital requirements we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects 
while we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our subordinated notes facility should allow us to finance our planned operations through based on current conditions and expectations  additional financing will be required in the future to fund our exploration and development activities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional financing on reasonable terms or at all  or that financing will continue to be available to us under our existing or new financing arrangements 
without additional capital resources  our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
see liquidity and capital resources 
volatility of oil and gas markets affects us  oil and natural gas prices are volatile our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
market prices of oil and natural gas depend on many factors beyond our control  including o worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  o the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  o political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  o the price and level of foreign imports  o the level of consumer demand  o the price and availability of alternative fuels  o the availability of pipeline capacity  o weather conditions  o domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and o the overall economic environment 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
during  the high and low settlement prices for oil on the nymex were per bbl and per bbl  and the high and low settlement prices for natural gas on the nymex were per mmbtu and per mmbtu 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business o limit our financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations  o reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  o cause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects  o reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flow  and o reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
our hedging transactions may not prevent losses in an attempt to reduce our sensitivity to energy price volatility  we use swap and collar hedging arrangements that generally result in a fixed price or a range of minimum and maximum price limits over a specified monthly time period 
if we do not produce our oil and natural gas reserves at rates equivalent to our hedged position  we would be required to satisfy our obligations under hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of our own production 
this situation occurred during a portion of and again during portions of  due in part to our sale of certain producing reserves in mid as a result  our cash flow was significantly reduced  particularly during because the terms of our hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation and marketing costs to delivery points  substantial differences between the hedged prices and actual results could harm our anticipated profit margins and our ability to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
hedging contracts limit the benefits we will realize if actual prices rise above the contract prices 
we could be financially harmed if the other party to the hedging contracts proves unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts

exploratory drilling is a speculative activity involving numerous risks and uncertain costs  we are dependent on exploratory drilling activities our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the success of our exploratory drilling program 
exploratory drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs 
we cannot always predict the cost of drilling  and we may be forced to limit  delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors  including o unexpected drilling conditions  o pressure or irregularities in formations  o equipment failures or accidents  o adverse weather conditions  o compliance with governmental requirements  and o shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
we may not be successful in our future drilling activities because even with the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies  exploratory drilling is a speculative activity 
we could incur losses because our use of d seismic data and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
even when fully utilized and properly interpreted  our d seismic data and other advanced technologies only assist us in identifying subsurface structures and do not indicate whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures 
because we interpret the areas desirable for drilling from d seismic data gathered over large areas  we may not acquire option and lease rights until after the seismic data is available and  in some cases  until the drilling locations are also identified 
although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations  we cannot assure you that we will ever lease  drill or produce oil or natural gas oil from these or any other potential drilling locations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our drilling activities  that our overall drilling success rate for activity within a particular province will not decline  or that our completed wells will ultimately produce our estimated economically recoverable reserves 
unsuccessful drilling activities could materially harm our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to various casualty risks our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as o fires  o natural disasters  o formations with abnormal pressures  o blowouts  cratering and explosions  and o pipeline ruptures and spills 
any of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others 
see item business operating hazards and uninsured risks 
we may not have enough insurance to cover some operating risks we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against operating hazards 
we may elect to self insure if our management believes that the cost of insurance  although available  is excessive relative to the risks presented 
we generally maintain insurance for the hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas and believe this insurance is adequate 
if an event occurs that is not covered  or not fully covered  by insurance  it could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot fully insure against pollution and environmental risks 
the marketability of our production is dependent on facilities that we typically do not own or control the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
we generally deliver natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own 
our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas could be harmed by any dramatic change in market factors or by o federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  o tax and energy policies  o changes in supply and demand  and o general economic conditions 
we have historical operating losses and our future results may vary  we have incurred net losses in each year of operation we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and total stockholders equity of million 
we have recognized the following annual net losses before extraordinary items since million in   in  million including a net million non cash deferred income tax charge incurred in connection with our conversion from a partnership to a corporation in  million including a million non cash writedown in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in  million including a million non cash loss on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in  and million in see item selected financial data 
our future operating results may fluctuate our future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including o industry conditions  o prices of oil and natural gas  o rates of drilling success  o capital availability  o rates of production from completed wells  and o the timing and amount of capital expenditures 
this variability could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  any failure or delay in the realization of expected cash flows from operating activities could limit our ability to invest and participate in economically attractive projects 
maintaining reserves and revenues in the future depends on successful exploration and development in general  production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
our future oil and natural gas production depends highly upon our ability to economically find  develop or acquire reserves in commercial quantities 
the business of exploring for or developing reserves is capital intensive 
reductions in our cash flow from operations and limitations on or unavailability of external sources of capital may impair our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our future exploration and development activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
furthermore  although significant increases in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas could cause increases in our revenues  our finding and development costs could also increase 
finally  we participate in a percentage of our wells as a non operator 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  or an operator s breach of the applicable agreements  could harm us 
we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows there is substantial uncertainty in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
no one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way 
accordingly  oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimations of those accumulations 
estimates of other engineers might differ widely from those of our independent petroleum engineers 
accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
our independent petroleum engineers may make material changes to reserve estimates based on the results of actual drilling  testing  and production 
as a result  our reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas we ultimately recover 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows 
see item properties oil and natural gas reserves 
actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as o the amount and timing of actual production  o supply and demand for oil and natural gas  o limits or increases in consumption by gas purchasers  and o changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with the sec reporting requirements may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
we face significant competition we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production with other companies 
we face intense competition from a large number of independent  technology driven companies as well as both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in a number of areas such as o seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  o marketing our oil and natural gas production  and o seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop those properties 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
this highly competitive environment could harm our business

our operations are subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal  state and local governmental authorities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments brigham limits its use of derivative instruments principally to commodity price hedging activities  whereby gains and losses are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity 
brigham s use of derivative instruments for hedging activities could materially affect its results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods since such instruments can limit brigham s ability to benefit from favorable oil and natural gas price movements 
commodity price risk brigham s primary commodity market risk exposure is to changes in the prices related to the sale of its oil and natural gas production 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
as such  brigham employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the sales prices it receives for its oil and natural gas production through hedging activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters derivative instruments 
brigham believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows it to reduce its exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby to achieve more predictable cash flows 
however  hedging arrangements  when utilized  may limit the benefit to brigham of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  brigham s hedging arrangements generally do not apply to all of its production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
brigham expects that the amount of its hedges will vary from time to time 
interest rate risk brigham is subject to interest rate risk as borrowings under its senior credit facility million outstanding as of december  accrue interest at floating rates based on the lender s base rate or libor 
brigham does not utilize derivative instruments to protect against changes in interest rates on debt borrowings 
based on brigham s million of outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility at december   an adverse change defined as a hypothetical and increase in interest rates on such borrowings would reduce cash flow by approximately  and million  respectively  from currently projected levels
