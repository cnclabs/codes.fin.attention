in the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit of  from the recognition of a portion of its deferred tax asset as a result of current period taxable losses 
a deferred tax liability was generated by a change in tax accounting method for mercy air s trade receivables from cash to accrual basis when the company acquired mercy air in the taxable income created by this change was unable to be offset by the company s net operating loss carryforwards but could be offset by current period taxable losses 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  as of december   compared to  at december  the change in working capital position is primarily attributable to an increase in receivables resulting from the arch acquisition and increased revenue for all three operating segments 
the impact of the increase in receivables on working capital was offset in part by a shift in contract billings from costs in excess of billings to billings in excess of costs in the balance of costs in excess of billings in consisted primarily of costs on the uh q project which were invoiced in january after billing terms for the contract were finalized

air medical services division six hospital contracts are due for renewal in two of the contracts were renewed during the first quarter of  both for additional five year terms  renewals on the other four contracts are still pending 
during the first quarter the company entered into two agreements to expand services with current hospital customers in texas and arizona with the deployment of additional aircraft 
a third bell helicopter was added to the operations in texas during the first quarter  and a third bell helicopter is expected to be added to the operations in arizona during the second quarter 
the company expects flight activity for current hospital contracts to remain consistent with historical levels 
mercy air service the company expects flight volume for mercy air s operations to be consistent with historical levels during  subject to seasonal  weather related fluctuations  with increases for a full year of operations within the arch subsidiary 
the company expects to open a second base in illinois as part of the arch operations during products division in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  the products division was awarded five new contracts valued at approximately  to manufacture medical interior systems for multiple types of aircraft 
work on all five contracts is expected to continue through the first quarter of the company has received a verbal commitment and expects to be awarded a contract for five hh l formerly known as uh q multi mission medevac systems during the second quarter of production will commence immediately upon award and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the current us army aviation modernization plan continues to define a requirement for units in total over the next years 
the us army program objective memorandum pom anticipates funding for this requirement with eight units per year scheduled in fiscal years and and fifteen units per year scheduled from fiscal year through the end of the program 
there is no assurance that the current contract option will be exercised or orders for additional units received in or in future periods 
the development contract of the scits program for the us air force usaf is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the long range usaf plan defines a requirement for to units over the next five years 
although the company expects the production contract to be awarded in the third quarter of  there can be no assurance that the contract will be awarded in or in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to renew operating agreements for the air medical services division  generate new profitable contracts for the products division  or expand flight volume for mercy air 
however  based on the anticipated level of flight activity for its hospital customers and mercy air and the projects in process for the products division  the company expects to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its operational needs throughout risk factors actual results achieved by the company may differ materially from those described in forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  those discussed above in outlook for and those described below 
flight volume all of mercy air s revenue and approximately of the air medical services division s revenue is dependent upon flight volume 
approximately of the company s operating expenses also vary with number of hours flown 
poor visibility  high winds  and heavy precipitation can affect the safe operation of helicopters and therefore result in a reduced number of flight hours due to the inability to fly during these conditions 
prolonged periods of adverse weather conditions  especially in southern california and missouri where mercy air s operations are concentrated  could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
in southern california and the st 
louis region  the months from november through february tend to have lower flight volume due to weather conditions and other factors  resulting in lower operating revenue for mercy air during these months 
flight volume for mercy air s operations can also be affected by the distribution of calls among competitors by local government agencies and the entrance of new competitors into a market 
collection rates mercy air invoices patients and their insurers directly for services rendered and recognizes revenue net of estimated contractual allowances 
the level of bad debt expense is driven by collection rates on these accounts 
collectibility is primarily dependent upon the health of the us economy  especially in southern california and the st 
louis region 
changes in estimated contractual allowances and bad debts are recognized based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
a significant or sustained downturn in the us economy could have an adverse impact on the company s bad debt expense 
dependence on third party suppliers the company currently obtains a substantial portion of its helicopter spare parts and components from bell helicopter  inc bell and american eurocopter corporation aec  because its fleet is composed primarily of bell and eurocopter aircraft  and maintains supply arrangements with other parties for its engine and related dynamic components 
based upon the manufacturing capabilities and industry contacts of bell  aec  and other suppliers  the company believes it will not be subject to material interruptions or delays in obtaining aircraft parts and components but does not have an alternative source of supply for bell  aec  and certain other aircraft parts 
failure or significant delay by these vendors in providing necessary parts could  in the absence of alternative sources of supply  have a material adverse effect on the company 
because of its dependence upon bell and aec for helicopter parts  the company could also be subject to adverse impacts from unusually high price increases which are greater than overall inflationary trends 
increases in the company s flight fees billed to its customers are generally limited to changes in the consumer price index 
department of defense funding two of the significant projects in process for the products division  uh q and scits  are both dependent upon department of defense funding 
failure of the us congress to approve funding for the production of additional uh q or scits units could have a material adverse impact on products division revenue 
governmental regulation the air medical transportation services and products industry is subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies  including the federal aviation administration  which impose significant compliance costs on the company 
in addition  reimbursement rates for air ambulance services established by governmental programs such as medicare directly affect mercy air s revenue and indirectly affect air medical services division s revenue from its hospital customers 
changes in laws or regulations or reimbursement rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s cost of operations or revenue from flight operations 
competition the air medical services division faces significant competition from several national and regional air medical transportation providers for contracts with hospitals and other healthcare institutions 
mercy air also faces competition from smaller regional carriers and alternative air ambulance providers such as sheriff departments 
operators generally compete on the basis of price  safety record  accident prevention and training  and the medical capability of the aircraft offered 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully for new or renewing contracts in the future 
new accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no

the adoption of fin had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company does not use financial instruments to any degree to manage these risk and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
all of the company s product sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and notes receivable  all of which have fixed interest rates  except the line of credit 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december
