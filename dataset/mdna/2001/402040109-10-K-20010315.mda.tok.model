item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we operated retail locations in major markets and stores in secondary markets as of december  we also operate the largest direct response channel musician s friend catalog and internet in the musical instruments industry in the united states 
from to  our net sales grew at an annual compound growth rate of  principally due to the comparable store sales growth of our guitar center stores averaging per year  the opening of new stores  and a  per year increase in the direct response channel 
we believe such volume increases are the result of the continued success of the implementation of our business strategy  continued growth in the music products industry and increasing consumer awareness of the guitar center and musician s friend brand names 
we achieved comparable store sales growth of  and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
as indicated below  we do not expect comparable store sales to continue to increase at historical rates 
we opened fourteen stores this year  one of which was acquired from veneman music in may presently  we expect to open approximately to stores in and to stores in in preparation for these additional stores  we have dedicated a substantial amount of resources over the past several years to building the infrastructure necessary to support a large  national chain 
we have established centralized operating and financial controls and have implemented an extensive training program to ensure a high level of customer service in our stores 
we will continue to pursue our strategy of clustering stores in major markets to take advantage of operating and advertising efficiencies and to build awareness of the guitar center name in new markets 
in some markets this clustering strategy results in some transfer of sales from existing stores to new locations  thereby adversely affecting comparable store sales statistics 
as we enter new markets  we expect that we will initially incur higher administrative and promotional costs per store than is currently experienced in established markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase as other music product retailers attempt to execute national growth strategies 
our business strategy will also emphasize opportunities to grow our direct response business  particularly opportunities to increase our internet activities 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the e commerce and related business activities of guitar center and musician s friend

net income for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our need for liquidity will arise primarily from interest payable on indebtedness and the funding of capital expenditures and working capital requirements  as well as investments and possible acquisitions 
we have historically financed our operations through internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we have no mandatory payments of principal on the million of senior notes outstanding prior to their final maturity in as of december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility  excluding million outstanding on standby letters of credit  and had available borrowings of million 
the credit facility permits borrowings up to million million at december  and can be increased at our election up to million  subject to compliance with the terms of the loan agreement 
the credit facility is secured by certain assets and the actual amount available is tied to our inventory and receivable base 
a fee of is assessed on the unused portion of the credit facility 
borrowings bear interest at either the prime rate at december  plus or at libor at december  plus 
the agreement underlying the credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants 
we were in compliance with such requirements as of december  for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  most of which represented cash income from operations  net of additions to inventory 
cash used in investing activities totaled million  which primarily consisted of capital expenditures for retail store expansions  computer equipment purchases and the launching of our kansas city warehouse for our direct response unit million  the acquisition of veneman music company million  and an investment in a non consolidated entity million 
cash used in financing activities totaled million  which consisted principally of paying down our credit facilities

the increase in inventory was required principally to support existing sales growth and the opening of new retail locations 
inventory per square foot at retail stores was in compared to in inventory increased from million to million  or for the direct response division 
the increase in inventory was required principally to support future sales 
our ongoing objective is to improve inventory performance by refining our replenishment processes and systems  and through improved planning  presentation  and display of inventories in our retail stores 
we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by opening additional stores in new and existing markets 
during  we opened fourteen new stores  one of which was acquired from veneman music company in the second quarter of each new large format guitar center store typically has required approximately million for gross inventory 
historically  our cost of capital improvements for an average large format guitar center store has been approximately  consisting of leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment 
we incur higher costs in some geographic areas  particularly the northeast 
we have developed a smaller format guitar center store to operate in secondary markets or sites that we do not believe will support our large format unit 
the first of these units was opened in late our small format stores will incur approximately  in capital expenditures and require approximately  in inventory 
during  we expect to incur approximately million to million in capital expenditures 
we are also currently evaluating additional capital and strategic requirements related to improving our fulfillment facilities and technology and pursuing new opportunities in the e commerce activities of guitar center and musician s friend  and related businesses 
the initiatives related to fulfillment include leasing a new distribution facility for musician s friend in kansas city  which is operational  and our plan to construct a distribution facility to support the retail business 
the construction and operation of the retail distribution facility will require the expenditure of significant capital  as well as the development of a team of key employees to manage this new function 
we will also continue to make significant investments in information technology across our businesses and will incur costs and make investments designed to expand the reach of the guitar center and musician s friend brands on the internet 
the costs of these initiatives and other investments related to our businesses will continue to be significant and are not included in our capital expenditure budget noted above 
our expansion strategy is to continue to increase our market share in existing markets and to penetrate strategically selected new markets 
we opened a total of stores in and stores in  and currently anticipate opening approximately to stores in some of these stores will be new smaller format units designed for secondary markets 
we also believe there may be attractive opportunities to expand by selectively acquiring existing music products retailers 
however  in the music industry there are only a small number of companies that would strategically and financially be a beneficial opportunity for us to acquire 
our average store is  square feet  carrying  skus and generating first year sales of million  whereas the average industry store is  square feet  carrying  skus and generating sales of million 
we may also consider acquisitions which are complementary to other parts of our business  such as our direct response division  if attractive opportunities can be identified 
our capital resources and liquidity are expected to be provided by net cash flow from operations and additional borrowings under the credit facility 
depending upon market conditions  we may also incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital  if and when required  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

income taxes the former stockholders of the musician s friend business are involved in a tax audit with the internal revenue service regarding the conduct of the business prior to the merger with guitar center 
those proceedings may result in nols that have previously been recognized by us in our consolidated financial statements being deemed to be the property of the former stockholders 
guitar center has filed a protective claim with the stockholders that such a loss of tax benefit would be subject to indemnification under the express terms of the agreement and plan of merger among the parties dated may  if such nols were lost and the indemnification claim asserted and paid  we would be obligated to pay prior period federal income taxes previously offset by the use of nols  but would be entitled to an offsetting recovery of common stock held in escrow under the agreement and plan of merger 
this issue is not resolved as of the date of this report and we can provide no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this matter 
given the high level of uncertainty that surrounds this matter  no provision has been made in our financial statements 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability

at december   we had million outstanding under the line of credit 
to the extent prevailing short term interest rates fluctuate  the interest expense we incur on the line of credit will change with a resulting effect positive or negative on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  based on the balances outstanding under the line of credit at year end  such a fluctuation would have to be relatively significant to have a material financial impact on us 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
presently  we do not carry significant cash balances as any cash in excess of our daily operating needs is used to reduce our line of credit borrowings
