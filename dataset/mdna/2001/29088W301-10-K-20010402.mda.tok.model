item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition we generate the majority of our revenue from cattle sales transactions where we act as either a principal or agent in the purchase and sale of cattle 
for cattle sales transactions where we are the principal in the arrangement  we purchase cattle from the seller  record the cattle as inventory until delivered to an accepted buyer and are exposed to inventory  credit and market risk that results from the transaction 
in these types of transactions  we record the gross revenue earned and related product costs incurred 
for cattle sales transactions in which we act as an agent  we sell cattle consigned to us on a commission basis  where we are subject to inventory and credit risk  or we sell cattle on a fee basis 
in both types of transactions  we record the commission or fee earned as revenue 
for all other products and services we offer  we act as a principal to the transaction and gross revenue and related product cost are recognized as products are shipped or services are provided 
in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab was followed by staff accounting bulletin no 
a  implementation issues related to sab  in march and by staff accounting bulletin no 
b  second amendment revenue recognition in financial statements sab b  in june in october  the sec issued a frequently asked questions and answers document to provide additional guidance 
these documents summarize certain views of the sec regarding applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sec has provided this guidance due  in part  to the large number of revenue recognition issues that registrants encounter 
we believe that our current revenue recognition policies comply with sab acquisitions in february  we purchased substantially all of the assets of cin  llc  a company which collected  analyzed and distributed information for use in the cattle industry  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the purchase price consisted of  shares of our class a common stock valued at  the assumption of  of liabilities  a cash payment of  an agreement to pay the first  from internet sales of third party products over the web site and transaction costs of  in march  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of cyberstockyard  inc  a company selling cattle and other products through auction software over the internet for approximately  the purchase price consisted of  shares of our class a common stock valued at  the assumption of  of liabilities and transaction costs of  in may  we purchased substantially all of the assets of professional cattle consultants  llc for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the purchase price consisted of million of cash  the assumption of  of liabilities and transaction costs of  the primary asset of professional cattle consultants  llc was a proprietary database of cattle and market information and analysis

in august  we acquired of the common stock of turnkey computer systems  inc  turnkey a provider of administrative accounting legacy systems to feedlots  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase price consisted of  shares of our class a common stock  million of cash and  of transaction costs 
in connection with this investment  we obtained the exclusive right to provide cattle sales and auction services and feed sales services to customers of turnkey through turnkey s system 
this right will expire in august if we reach a specified level of revenue per feedlot and that feedlot is a customer of turnkey  we will pay a fee to turnkey

we now have direct ownership in of the issued and outstanding capital stock of turnkey

all acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  except for turnkey  which was accounted for using the equity method subsequent to the october transaction 
the results of operations of the acquired entities are included in our consolidated statements of operations since their respective dates of purchase 
all goodwill and intangible assets associated with these acquisitions were being amortized over five years on a straight line basis  except for the goodwill related to the turnkey acquisition  which is being amortized over ten years on a straight line basis 
through these acquisitions  we have significantly increased our capacity to market cattle throughout the united states 
because of the significance of these acquisitions and the resulting additions to our products and services  our historical financial results may not be indicative of our future performance 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the net losses and accumulated deficit resulted from our lack of substantial revenues prior to fiscal year  increased costs associated with the significant personnel infrastructure required to support our growing business and other costs incurred for the development and marketing of our products 
we have only recently begun to generate significant revenue and have yet to achieve profitability 
we may never be able to generate or sustain significant profitability  nor may we be able to sustain our current revenue growth 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenue from cattle sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase reflects a higher volume of cattle sales transactions brought about primarily through our acquisition activities 
during the fiscal year ended december   we sold approximately million head of cattle versus  head sold in the comparable prior year period 
revenue from other products and services increased by from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to incremental revenues of approximately  derived from subscriptions to our comparative feedlot analysis and market information services  the addition of advertising revenue  and sales of cattle related products 
the increased revenue derived from other products and services was partially offset by a decline of approximately  in sales of our equine imaging systems and related inventory and relatively flat nutricharge sales 
in december  we determined that the additional resources required to successfully commercialize our nutricharge and infrared imaging products were not warranted given our current operating environment and business strategies 
accordingly  we determined during this period that it was no longer feasible to continue offering these products 
we expect that cattle revenue will continue to account for the majority of our revenue base for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the direct cost to acquire cattle  cattle related products  and equine imaging systems components 
in addition  cost of revenue also includes the indirect overhead costs  such as support personnel  facilities costs  telecommunication charges and depreciation  that are associated with supporting our expanding base of on line products and services and with the production of the equine imaging system 
with the higher volumes of cattle sales transactions generated in fiscal year  cost of revenue attributed to cattle sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  cost of revenue attributed to other products and services increased by from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is due principally to higher indirect overhead and an increase in cattle related product costs 
higher costs of revenue for other products and services were partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with our equine imaging systems 
we generated a gross profit of  and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit is due primarily to the increase in cattle revenue as cost of goods did not increase in proportion to the increase in revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs for sales and marketing personnel  recruiting and relocation charges  consulting fees  travel  telephone and advertising and trade shows 
selling expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   and included non cash compensation charges of million associated with employee separations during the second quarter of fiscal year the remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses is due primarily to costs associated with expanding the number of personnel within the organization  most notably from salaries and wages  as well as higher telephone  travel and advertising costs 
these expenses were partially offset by reductions in bonus and consulting charges 
we expect these costs to continue to increase as we continue to pursue additional sales and marketing opportunities 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs for executive  administrative  and finance personnel  insurance program charges  travel and professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to costs associated with expanding the number of personnel within the organization  most notably from salaries and wages  increased acquisition activity  which also brought about a rise in property and insurance costs  and higher legal  investor relations and travel expenses  which were required to support and grow our publicly held business 
we expect these expenses to continue to increase as additional acquisitions are made  personnel are hired  and expenses are incurred to support future growth 
our technology and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs  payments to outside consultants  and project material costs 
our expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to costs associated with expanding the number of personnel within the organization  most notably from salaries and wages 
in addition  increased spending for consultants and materials and supplies was required to integrate and expand our growing product lines such as our online cattle sales and auction software and interactive manager software formerly referred to as feedlot information system software 
we expect to continue to incur costs to develop and commercialize new products  expand our offerings and adapt our technologies to new markets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to higher amortization charges resulting from business acquisitions completed in increases in capital spending to support our infrastructure build up also drove higher depreciation during we expect both depreciation and amortization will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as new projects are placed into service and the newly acquired businesses begin their first full year of operation under our ownership 
we recorded impairment and related charges of million during december to write off the remaining net book values of accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles and fixed assets  and accrue for outstanding commitments that were associated with our nutricharge and infrared imaging products 
based on an assessment of our current operating environment  the resources required to successfully commercialize these products and our business strategies  we determined during this period that it was no longer feasible to continue offering these products 
the impairment charge primarily related to the write off of million in remaining net book values of intangible assets 
interest and other income expense  net rose from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased interest income generated by short term investments and a reduction in interest expense on related party debt that was repaid following our initial public offering 
currently  we invest the majority of our cash balances in debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers 
included in interest and other income expense  net is million of imputed interest income recognized in from a million note receivable due from internet capital group 
the note receivable was executed in connection with an october securities purchase agreement and was paid in full in november due to the losses incurred  we did not recognize income tax expense for the year ended december  and as of december   we had approximately million of federal income tax loss carry forwards that can be used to offset future taxable income 
our tax loss carry forwards begin to expire in and we are not currently aware of any limitation on our ability to offset future taxable income 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenue from cattle sales increased to million for the year ended december  there was no revenue from cattle sales in revenue from other products decreased by from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to lower revenue from sales of our equine imaging systems reflecting a decline in units sold 
increased sales of nutricharge and the sale of subscriptions to our comparative feedlot analysis and market information service partially offset the decline in revenue from equine camera sales 
as previously indicated  we determined during december that it was no longer feasible to continue offering our nutricharge and infrared imaging products 
cost of revenue consisted primarily of the direct cost to acquire cattle  nutricharge and equine imaging systems components and indirect manufacturing overhead costs such as support personnel  facilities costs  and supplies  which were primarily associated with the production of equine imaging systems 
direct costs attributed to cattle sales were million for the year ended december  there were no direct costs from cattle sales in costs attributed to other products decreased by from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due principally to the decline in unit sales of equine imaging systems and associated reductions in manufacturing overhead 
we generated a gross loss of  for the year ended december  and a gross profit of  for the year ended december  the change from a gross loss to a gross profit was due primarily to the increase in cattle revenue  while cost of goods  principally manufacturing overhead  did not increase in proportion to the increase in revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  selling expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related benefit costs  commissions for sales and marketing personnel  consulting fees  travel and entertainment  advertising and trade shows 
selling expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to expenses associated with expanding the number of personnel from people at december  to people at december  and higher consulting  travel and advertising costs to effect our business strategy 
our general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries  bonuses and related benefit costs for executives and administrative personnel and professional service fees  including administrative support fees to xl vision and safeguard 
we have contractual service agreements with xl vision and safeguard scientifics 
under an administrative services agreement dated december   as amended on august   xl vision and safeguard provided us with management consultation  investor relations  financial management  human resource management  legal services  insurance programs  and administrative services 
we paid a fee calculated pursuant to a formula that was based on a percentage of our revenue  not to exceed  annually 
the fee was not due until we achieved positive cash flow from operations 
the agreement extended through december  and continues unless terminated by either party 
during april  the administrative services agreement with safeguard was terminated 
in october  the agreement with xl vision was amended to change the methodology for calculating fees due under the agreement 
presently  administrative services fees are based upon an estimate of hours spent by xl vision personnel in support of our business 
these estimates are reviewed periodically by both parties and adjusted when necessary to reflect actual services rendered 
as of december   we had not paid any amounts due to xl vision and safeguard under these agreements 
as of december  we owed xl vision and safeguard approximately  and  respectively  under these agreements 
in addition  under a direct charge administrative services agreement dated april   xl vision also provided us with management services on a time and materials basis 
this agreement continued on a month to month basis  and was terminated during december as of december   we owed xl vision  under this agreement 
the amounts due under these agreements at december  were repaid in february following the completion of our ipo 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased expenses associated with expanding the number of personnel from people at december  to people at december  and increased legal and travel expenses required to support and grow our business 
our technology and development expenses consisted of salaries and related benefit costs  payments to outside consultants  and material costs for prototype imaging systems 
our expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in expenses was primarily due to increased consulting costs  an increase in personnel  and increased spending for materials and supplies 
the increase in expenses was required to integrate and expand our product lines such as our online cattle sales and auction software  feedlot information system software  and continued development efforts on imaging systems 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to higher amortization charges resulting from three business combinations completed in and acquisitions of proprietary licenses made during july interest expense other income  net decreased by from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a lower average level of borrowing accompanied by an increase in interest income 
included in interest and other income expense  net was  of imputed interest income recognized in from a million note receivable due from internet capital group 
the note receivable was executed in connection with an october securities purchase agreement and was paid in full in november due to the losses incurred  we did not have any income tax expense for the year ended december  or the year ended december  as of december  we had approximately million of federal income tax loss carry forwards that can be used to offset future taxable income 
our tax loss carry forwards begin to expire in and we are not currently aware of any limitation on our ability to offset future taxable income 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the quarters ended march  june  september  and december   and march  june  september  and december  the information for each quarter has been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited statements included in other parts of this form k report and  in the opinion of management  include all adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for such periods

during february  we completed our initial public offering of  common shares and a private placement of  common shares  which generated net proceeds of million 
subsequent to the offering  approximately million of the proceeds were used to pay amounts due to related parties and turnkey computer systems  million was used for acquisitions of other businesses  and million was used for capital expenditures 
we believe that the net proceeds from the offering  together with our existing cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months under our current business plan  which may change 
to the extent we are required to raise additional capital  we may need to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  such financing may not be on terms favorable to us 
if such financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue to expand our business  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
in addition  we may be unable to further develop or enhance our products and services 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   our primary source of liquidity consisted of cash and highly liquid  high quality debt instruments 
our intent is to make such funds  which have maturities of less than three months  readily available for operating purposes 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash  primarily certificates of deposit  totaling million compared to million at december  subsequent to december   we closed on the acquisitions of bluegrass stockyards  runnells peters cattle company  and pennell cattle company that required the use of approximately million of cash 
in addition  we also paid the former shareholders of eastern million in cash during february pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated may  we have had significant negative cash flows from operating activities for each fiscal and quarterly period to date 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of net operating losses and increases in trade accounts receivable offset in part by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
due to the seasonality associated with our business  cash used in operating activities was greatest during the third and fourth quarters of when accounts receivable and inventory balances were at their highest levels during the year 
net cash used in investing activities was  in  million in and million in our investing activities included the acquisitions of eastern  jordan  edens  lemaster  mountain plains  mcmahan  thigpen  hefley and jansma for a combined million and capital expenditures of million 
we expect continued acquisition activity and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future as we continue to effect our business strategy 
however  we expect future spending on acquisitions and capital expenditures to be at a lower rate than experienced during net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities prior to consisted primarily of the sale of our stock and borrowings from internet capital group  xl vision and safeguard 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily generated from our initial public offering and private placement  which raised net proceeds of million  as well as the receipt of million from internet capital group in full settlement of a note receivable executed in october these amounts were partially offset by related party payments of million to safeguard scientifics  inc and million to xl vision and the repayment of a  note payable due to turnkey computer systems 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
in june to require implementation of the standard beginning january  sfas no 
was amended further by sfas no 
in june the adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  is not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into purchase and sale contracts for cattle that require delivery at a future date 
we believe that these transactions fall under the normal purchases and normal sales exception described within sfas no 
 as amended 
we also enter into a limited number of cattle futures transactions 
currently  we do not maintain the documentation required by the standard to qualify for hedge accounting with respect to cattle futures transactions 
accordingly  if sfas no 
 as amended  was adopted as of december   we would have recorded a charge to operations of approximately  factors affecting our business  financial condition  and results of operations in addition to the other information included in this report and our other public filings and releases  the following factors should be considered while evaluating our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects we have a limited operating history and unproven business model 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately predict future results and our business strategy may not be successful 
we commenced operations in and commercially released our initial product in november accordingly  we have only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business 
in addition  our business strategy and revenue model has changed significantly during the past months 
our limited operating history  combined with our shift in business strategy  makes predicting our future results of operations difficult 
our new business model has not been tested and  accordingly  we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful 
specific uncertainties relating to our new business model include our ability to achieve acceptance of our web site as a marketplace for electronic commerce  expand the number of cattle producers  feedlots and packers that utilize our services  develop and upgrade our products and technologies more effectively and rapidly than our competitors  and successfully implement our acquisition  sales and marketing strategies 
we have a history of net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
if we continue to incur net losses  our business may not ultimately be financially viable 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
we reported a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  and a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue 
as of december   we had accumulated net losses totaling approximately million 
our operating expenses have increased significantly in each year of our operation  and we anticipate that such expenses will continue to increase over the next several years as we expand our operations and execute on our business strategies 
our revenue may not grow or may not even continue at its current level and  as a result  our financial condition and results of our operations may be harmed and our business may not be financially viable in the future 
to achieve profitability  we must successfully address the following risks lack of wide scale commercial acceptance of our internet cattle sales and services  failure to expand the number of livestock industry participants currently using our network  failure to obtain access to data from feedlots to adequately address the information needs of our customers  inability to respond promptly to competitive and industry developments  failure to achieve brand recognition  failure to introduce new products and services  and failure to upgrade and enhance our technologies to accommodate expanded product and service offerings and increased customer traffic 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business may be harmed 
the internet livestock products and services market  including  in particular  the cattle sales market  is new and uncertain and our business may not develop as we anticipate 
the internet market for livestock products and services  including  in particular  the cattle sales market  has only recently developed  and its continued development is subject to substantial uncertainty 
to date  we have not realized adequate revenues and gross margins from this market to achieve profitability 
we cannot be assured that this market will continue to develop as we expect  if at all 
our revenue model depends on the commercial acceptance of our internet based products and services 
we do not know if our target customers will use the internet as a regular means of purchasing products and services 
even if potential customers choose to purchase livestock products and services over the internet  they may not choose our online services to do so 
if the market for livestock products and services over the internet does not develop as we anticipate  our business and the results of our operations will be harmed 
for the year december   we relied on cattle sales for over of our revenue and we expect to rely on the success of our cattle sales and auction services for a significant majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our ability to achieve commercial acceptance of our cattle sales is critical to our ability to obtain future revenue 
to date  we have not achieved enough revenues from internet based cattle sales that are sufficient for us to determine whether these services will achieve commercial acceptance 
any failure to successfully gain commercial acceptance of these services would harm our business and the results of our operations 
in addition  as the result of our dependence on cattle sales  if the demand for beef declines  the demand for our products and services would likely decline  and our results of operations would be harmed 
we recently completed significant acquisitions of businesses and technologies and we may make other business acquisitions in the future  which may be difficult to integrate into our business and may disrupt or negatively impact our business 
we recently made  and will continue to make  investments in and acquisitions of complementary companies  technologies and assets that constitute critical aspects of our current and future business operations 
if we fail to successfully integrate the operations of these companies  technologies or assets into our business  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 
in connection with a number of our acquisitions we hire key employees 
the businesses we have acquired generally are critical to our current business operations and growth strategy 
our acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating technologies  products  personnel and operations  diversion of our management s attention  entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and capital requirements in excess of what we anticipate 
in the future  acquiring companies  assets or technologies may also require us to make cash payments  assume debt  incur large write offs related to intangible assets and issue equity  which will dilute ownership interest 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business may be harmed 
we cannot assure that we will be able to effectively or successfully manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business operations would suffer 
we seek to grow by increasing transaction and subscription volume  adding new products and services and by hiring additional employees 
our growth is likely to place a significant strain on our resources and systems 
as we continue to increase the scope of our operations  we will need an effective planning and management process to implement our business strategy successfully and we will need to implement new and improve existing systems  procedures and controls 
we will also need to expand  train and manage our workforce 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law and confidentiality agreements with third parties 
we cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  the patents or trademarks may be challenged by other parties or invalidated 
because brand recognition is an important component of our business strategy  the protection of our trademarks is critical to our success 
in addition  we depend upon our proprietary database of industry and client information to provide our clients with our information services 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and technology or obtain access to our confidential proprietary database 
other parties may also breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts 
we may not become aware of these breaches or have adequate remedies available 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trademark protection may be unavailable in certain countries to which we might expand our operations 
in technology markets  there is generally frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims that we infringe third party proprietary rights 
while we are not aware of any patents  copyrights or other rights that would prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our products or services in the united states and abroad  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
there also can be no assurance that former employers of our present and future employees will not claim that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of our personnel 
we typically assume the ownership of cattle sold through our internet cattle marketplace and are subject to the risk of loss while we hold title and market risk 
in the sales transactions conducted through our internet cattle sales and auction services network  we typically contract to purchase cattle from a seller  identify a buyer for the cattle  take title to the cattle from the seller and then resell the cattle to the buyer 
in this process  we enter into a contract to purchase cattle in advance of entering into a contract to sell the cattle 
therefore  until we actually complete a sale transaction  we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to sell cattle that we are contractually obligated to purchase 
in addition  once we purchase the cattle  we assume title to the cattle for generally up to hours 
as a result  we assume the risk of liability  loss and deterioration in value of the cattle during that period 
as a result  our business may be harmed 
we depend on our key employees for our success 
the loss of any of these persons could harm our ability to compete 
the loss of the services of any key person could harm our business  including our ability to compete effectively 
our performance also depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate additional key officers and employees 
we may be unable to retain our employees or to attract  assimilate and retain other qualified employees with relevant livestock and electronic commerce industry skills in the future 
if we fail to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees  our business will be harmed 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we expect that our revenue and operating results will vary in the future as a result of a number of factors 
our quarterly results of operations may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results in the future may not follow any prior trends and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results 
the factors that affect our quarterly operating results include our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis  the introduction of new or enhanced web sites  products and services by us  and continued purchases by our existing customers 
in addition  a number of factors that are beyond our control will also affect our quarterly operating results  such as demand for our products and services  product and price competition  the introduction of new or enhanced web sites  products and services by our competitors  and significant downturns in our targeted markets 
our quarterly results could fluctuate as a result of seasonal fluctuations in the cattle industry 
the cattle industry has historically experienced  and continues to experience  seasonal fluctuations 
these seasonal patterns may cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results 
generally  a higher number of cattle are sold to feedlots during the third and fourth quarters as compared to the first and second quarters of each calendar year 
therefore  a greater number of sales transactions occur during these two calendar quarters 
due to our limited operating history and the recent changes in our business as a result of acquisitions  it is difficult to predict the effect that this seasonal pattern will have on our revenue and quarterly operating results 
our back up mechanisms are unproven  and therefore are vulnerable to damage or interruption which would harm our ability to reliably service our customers 
our network server  satellites  computers and facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of sources  including fire  flood  power loss  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  system failures  internet brownouts  computer viruses  electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
we depend on these systems to provide our customers with online cattle sales and auction services  feedlot and cattle industry analyses  and cattle inventory management tools 
any substantial interruptions could result in the loss of data and could impair our ability to provide our products and services to customers and to generate revenues 
presently  we do not have a formal disaster recovery plan in effect 
moreover  our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur if any of our internet based services are interrupted 
risks associated with the security of transactions and transmitting confidential information over the internet may negatively impact our electronic commerce business 
we believe that concern regarding the security of confidential information transmitted over the internet  such as credit card numbers and proprietary data  may prevent many potential customers from engaging in online transactions and may harm our business 
despite the measures we intend to take to enhance our internet security  our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if our security measures are circumvented  proprietary information could be misappropriated or our operations could be interrupted 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
if we do not adequately address these concerns or face any claims in connection with a breach of security  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
we could face liability for information retrieved from or transmitted through our web sites  which could result in high litigation or insurance costs 
as a publisher and distributor of online content  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we publish or distribute on our web sites 
any imposition of liability could negatively impact our reputation and result in increased insurance costs 
claims have been successfully brought against online services 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to cover us for all liability that may be imposed 
government regulation and legal uncertainties could result in additional burdens to doing business on the internet 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws including those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet that result in the imposition of additional costs on conducting business over the internet or impose additional restrictions on our ability to conduct our business operations 
in  the internet tax freedom act placed a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on internet access  except for taxes imposed prior to october   and on taxes that discriminate against online commerce 
however  congress may not renew this legislation in and state and local governments would be able to impose internet specific taxes on goods purchased electronically  in addition to taxes that are otherwise imposed on sales transactions 
internet capital group and safeguard will be able to control matters requiring stockholder approval 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may delay  deter or prevent acts that would result in a change of control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
internet capital group and safeguard are affiliated entities 
internet capital group and safeguard together have the power to vote approximately as of march  of the aggregate number of votes to which the holders of our common stock are entitled 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval 
in addition  currently five of the eight members of our board of directors also serve as directors and or officers of internet capital group and safeguard 
internet capital group has the right to elect two directors to our board 
under the joint venture agreement  safeguard and internet capital group have agreed to vote for two designees of safeguard and two designees of internet capital group in all future elections of directors 
internet capital group and safeguard will therefore have the ability to significantly influence our management 
our common stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock  like the market for internet related and technology companies in general  has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may be caused by factors such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  conditions or trends in the cattle industry  new sales formats of new products or services  changes in or failure by us to meet financial estimates of securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet industry  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had cattle futures contracts with purchase commitments of million and sales commitments of million 
the contract lives are generally less than six months 
any change in the value of the futures contracts is generally balanced by an offsetting position in the cash market prices of the delivered livestock 
our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and their potential impact on our investment portfolio 
we invest in marketable debt securities that meet high credit quality standards and limit our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our investments consisted of million in cash equivalents with maturities of less than three months and million in certificates of deposit with a maturity of less than six months 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  a percent increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or the fair value of our portfolio 
the impact on our future results of operations and the future value of our portfolio will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments
