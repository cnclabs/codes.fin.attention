in  a gain of approximately  was realized on the assignment of the mortgage on fox run apartments  as discussed above 
in  a gain of approximately  was recognized from the prepayment of the mortgage on lakeside apartments 
mortgage investment income decreased slightly for as compared to primarily due to the normal amortization of the mortgage base 
in addition  the mortgage base decreased due to one mortgage disposition in november with a principal balance of approximately  this represents an approximate decrease in the aggregate principal balance of the total mortgage portfolio since october interest and other income decreased for as compared to primarily due to the timing of temporary investment of mortgage disposition proceeds prior to distribution 
general and administrative expenses decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in temporary employment costs 
versus net earnings decreased for as compared to primarily due to a reduction in mortgage investment income and a decrease in gains on mortgage dispositions  as discussed below 
mortgage investment income decreased for as compared  primarily due to the disposition of the mortgages on portervillage i apartments in march  waters edge apartments in september and lakeside apartments in november interest and other income decreased for as compared to  primarily due to the timing of temporary investment of mortgage disposition proceeds prior to distributions 
asset management fees to related parties decreased for as compared  due to the reduction in the mortgage base

liquidity and capital resources on october   criimi mae  the parent of the general partner  and criimi mae management  inc  an affiliate of criimi mae and provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code 
such bankruptcy filings could result in certain adverse effects to the partnership 
for example  as a debtor in possession  criimi mae will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the general partner or to the general partner of cmslp  the partnership s sub advisor  without approval from the bankruptcy court 
even though this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general partner and the partnership  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership 
such bankruptcy filings could also result in the potential need to replace criimi mae management  inc as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership 
on november   the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland  in greenbelt  maryland the bankruptcy court confirmed criimi mae s and criimi mae management  inc s third amended joint plan of reorganization as amended and supplemented by praecipes filed with the bankruptcy court on july  and  and november   the plan 
criimi mae is working to complete the debt documentation  evidencing the secured financings to be provided by the unsecured creditors  and merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc and german american capital corporation collectively the new debt documents 
on march   the bankruptcy court approved an extension of the date by which the plan must be effective to april  the official committee of unsecured creditors had previously filed its own plan of reorganization and proposed disclosure statement  but has asked the bankruptcy court  subject to completion of mutually acceptable debt documentation  to defer consideration of its plan and proposed disclosure statement 
there can be no assurance at this time that criimi mae will be able to complete the new debt documents and effectuate the plan by april  the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  are the partnership s principal sources of cash flows  and were sufficient for the years ended december   and to meet operating requirements 
the partnership anticipates its cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expense requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages after paying all expenses of the partnership 
although insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each period due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base resulting from monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance of insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease 
the magnitude of the decrease will depend upon the size of the insured mortgages  which are prepaid  sold or assigned for insurance proceeds 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to  primarily due to an increase in the change in due from affiliate  receivables and other assets 
this change is primarily due to the timing of the receipt of interest on debentures received from affiliate 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to  due to the decrease in proceeds from mortgage dispositions and a decrease in debenture proceeds received from affiliate 
net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to due to a decrease in distributions paid to partners as a result of decreases discussed above 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a reduction in mortgage investment income 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased for as compared to  due to the decrease in proceeds from mortgage dispositions 
net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to due to a decrease in distributions paid to partners as a result of decreases discussed above
