days sales outstanding dso decreased to days at september   compared to days at september  the company calculates dso by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  by the annualized revenue for the most recent fiscal quarter  multiplied by the company believes that this method of deriving dso is indicative of actual results due to the cyclical nature of software license and service transactions  which are often consummated near the end of the quarter  as well as the fluctuation of transactions from one quarter to the next 
the company s accounts receivable balance at september   net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  was million 
this compares with million as of september  deferred revenue decreased million  from million at september   to million at september  the decrease in deferred revenue primarily resulted from a decrease in the deferred consulting services component of revenue

the company believes that it has sufficient cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand to fund its operations through at least fiscal while operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company anticipates growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash  and  consequently  such growth may require the company to obtain additional sources of financing 
the company s working capital and other capital requirements may change because of unanticipated changes in business conditions or delays in market acceptance of new products 
other considerations such as further expansion of operations or research and development activities  competitive and technological developments  and possible future acquisitions of businesses and or product rights may also affect the company s capital requirements

recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the company adopted sfas no 
which would apply to any future acquisitions entered into by the company 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing intangibles as goodwill and reassessment of the useful lives of existing intangibles 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year and does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements as the company has no goodwill or intangible assets related to prior acquisitions 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides for a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on its financial position or its results of operations 
factors affecting future performance product concentration 
as the company s primary current source of revenue comes from customers using ibm midrange computers  future revenue from licenses of present products and sales of services and recurring maintenance revenue are therefore dependent on continued widespread use of the ibm eserver iseries formerly the ibm as and the continued support of such computers by ibm 
in addition  because the company s current ibm eserver iseries formerly the ibm as product line requires the use of related operating systems  the company may be required to adapt its products to any changes made in such operating systems in the future 
the company s inability to adapt to future changes in the operating systems  or delays in doing so  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
rapid technological change and evolving market 
the business applications software market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards  and changes in customer demands 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to enhance products and services to meet changing customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  and marketing of these products and enhancements  or that any new products or product enhancements it may introduce will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter product development delays in the future or that  despite testing by the company  errors will not be found in new products or product enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of market share  delay in market acceptance  or warranty claims that could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company is continuing to develop software applications to operate over the internet and within corporate intranets 
the company s development and implementation of versions of its business software applications to operate in this manner involves more intense competition from a larger number of competitors 
the adoption of internet based software applications could be limited by concerns over transaction security and user privacy  the performance of the internet  and potential customers not seeing the value of these solutions 
competition 
the business applications software market is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
a number of companies offer products similar to the company s products and target the same customers as the company 
in addition  a number of companies are planning to offer products over the internet competitive to the company s products 
the company believes its ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside its control  including the timely development and production of new products and product enhancements  product functionality  performance  price  reliability  customer service and support  sales and marketing efforts  and product distribution 
the company believes that competition in its industry is undergoing rapid change and that the barriers to competition between market segments that have previously existed are decreasing 
due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  the company expects additional competition from other established and emerging companies in the client server business applications software market as well as from companies in the expanding internet business applications market that the company has entered 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
potential fluctuation of quarterly results 
the company s quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the company s lengthy sales cycle  the proportion of revenue attributable to license fees versus services revenue  changes in the level of operating expenses  demand for the company s products  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  changes in customer budgets  competitive conditions in the industry  and general economic conditions 
further  the purchase of the company s products often involves a significant commitment of capital by its customers with the attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures and authorization procedures within an organization 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycles for the company s products are typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which the company has little or no control 
the company historically has operated with little software license backlog because its software products are generally shipped as orders are received 
the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month 
as a result  license fees in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the last month or last week of that quarter 
accordingly  a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue for specific transactions would adversely and disproportionately affect the company s operating results for a quarter because the company establishes its expenditure levels on the basis of its expected future revenue and only a small portion of the company s expense varies with its revenue 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
due to the foregoing factors and other factors set forth in this form k  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of the company and public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
seasonality 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality 
in recent years  the company has had greater demand for its products in its fourth fiscal quarter and has experienced lower revenue in its succeeding first and second fiscal quarters 
the fluctuations are caused primarily by customer purchasing patterns and the company s sales recognition programs  which reward and recognize sales personnel on the basis of achievement of annual performance quotas 
discontinued products and segment 
in fiscal year  the company decided to discontinue new release development of infinium financials for microsoft windows nt and infinium human resources for microsoft windows nt  in order to focus additional resources towards deploying its other financial and human resource systems over the internet and expanding the breadth of its product lines 
additionally  in september  the company decided to discontinue its asp segment because it did not present an opportunity for timely profitability and was therefore determined to no longer be aligned with the company s strategic direction 
the company has worked with the customers of the discontinued products and segment to provide various alternative solutions  including migration to the company s other financial and human resources applications and identifying partners to continue to provide new release development of the discontinued products and transitioning asp customers to internal processing or other asp providers 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to encounter customer litigation resulting from these discontinuances that could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition 
the company is continuing to develop its financial and human resources systems for the ibm eserver iseries formerly the ibm as and the advantage human resources  payroll and e resources systems for microsoft windows nt  which it acquired from cort 
international operations 
revenue from customers outside north america represented percent  percent  and percent of the company s total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company believes that its revenue and future operating results will depend  in part  on its ability to increase sales in international markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase its current level of international revenue 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  and other trade barriers  costs  and difficulties of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and economic instability 
there can be no assurance that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international revenue and  consequently  on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
operating losses 
the company experienced net losses of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company expects  through its recent cost cutting measures  to improve its earnings results in the future 
if the company does achieve profitability  it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a long term basis 
changes in management 
during the past year  the company s management team has experienced significant change 
in february  james mcgowan was elected by the board of directors as the company s chief executive officer  president and a member of the board of directors 
in addition  several of the company s senior executives have ceased to serve in that capacity and there have been other changes in senior management in the company 
such changes can cause disruption in the company s operations and results 
additionally  due to the competitive nature of the industry  the company may not be able to retain its existing management and may be unable to hire qualified individuals to fill open positions on terms acceptable to the company 
change in stock listing 
the company s common stock had been traded on the nasdaq national market but  because of a determination by the nasdaq national market that the company no longer continued to meet all the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  its stock is now traded on the nasdaq small cap market 
this change in listing may have had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on the value of the company s common stock  because stocks trading on the nasdaq small cap market are typically less liquid than those traded on the nasdaq national market 
in addition  in the future  nasdaq may determine that the company no longer continues to meet all of the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq small cap market

historically  the company s primary exposures have been related to the operations of its foreign subsidiaries 
in fiscal  the net impact of foreign currency changes was thousand
