we are currently evaluating our various products  services  facilities and the business plan under which we are operating 
as part of this evaluation  we are reviewing the products and services we sell to customers  the locations in which we operate  and the manner in which we go to market with our core product and service offerings 
many alternatives are currently being considered but as of the current date no decisions have been made 
ultimately  we may decide to continue to operate as we do today  sustain certain products and services where customer commitments prevent us from eliminating the offering all together  or eliminate the offering through termination  sale or other disposition 
the results of these decisions will likely vary  depending on the product or service offering being considered and the decision that is ultimately made 
if a decision is made to eliminate any product or service  it will most likely involve the receipt or outlay of capital  realization of gains or losses  a reduction in workforce  facility consolidation  and the elimination of revenue streams and any related costs 
we currently have offices in argentina  brazil  canada  denmark  france  germany  ireland  italy  malaysia  sweden  switzerland  the united kingdom  and several cities throughout the united states 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  inclusive of a billion charge for impairment of certain long lived assets recorded in the fourth quarter of we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing  continued development of our network infrastructure  and continued technology enhancements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  recent acquisitions  and limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results  including gross profit margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
at december   we had  employees  in comparison with employees at december  and employees at december  we do not believe that our historical growth rates for revenue  expenses  or personnel are indicative of future results 
results of operations on february   we issued a press release announcing that we believed that our previously announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of may have been materially misstated  that the board of directors had formed a special committee to conduct an investigation into the matter  and that our president and vice president of worldwide sales had been placed on administrative leave related to the matter 
on february   we announced that  based on the preliminary results of the investigation being conducted  we would revise our previously announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of and were reviewing certain specific transactions that were reported as revenue during the third quarter of during february and march  the investigation by the special committee of the board of directors was completed  we completed our internal review  and our auditors completed the annual audit 
as a result  our financial results for certain periods within the year were materially restated or revised see note of notes to consolidated financial statements quarterly financial data unaudited

we added new hosted messaging clusters to our data centers during  expanding the capacity of our hosting network to manage current customer requirements and future growth 
additional costs were incurred during to add technology platforms for new service offerings 
as a result of these significant acquisitions of equipment and related support and professional services resources  depreciation and other costs during increased substantially in comparison with and cost of net service revenues also was impacted by the increased compensation and other personnel costs resulting from the additional headcount added through our ten acquisitions completed during and  and through our continued efforts to enhance our portfolio of product and service offerings

amortization of intangible assets in connection with our and acquisitions  which were all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets  primarily including assembled workforce  customer base  and existing technology 
there were no acquisitions in based on the types of identifiable intangibles acquired in  amortization expense of million was allocated to cost of net revenues and amortization expense of million was allocated to operating expenses 
all amortization expense was allocated to operating expenses in acquisition related retention bonuses in connection with the acquisitions of dotone  amplitude  xeti  faxnet  isocor  and docspace  we established various retention bonus programs that in the aggregate amounted to approximately million in incentives for certain former employees of these companies to encourage their continued employment with critical path see note of notes to consolidated financial statements acquisition related retention bonuses 
stock based expenses stock options 
we granted certain stock options with exercise prices below market value on the date of grant and issued certain common stock to employees  directors and advisors during and as a result  we recorded unearned compensation totaling million in and million in these amounts are being amortized over the vesting periods of the related options 
in march  in connection with an employee retention program  we granted options with exercise prices below market value on the date of grant to certain employees 
this program will result in approximately million in additional unearned compensation 
we expect aggregate annual amortization related to unearned compensation of million in  million in  and  in during  we also incurred stock based charges of approximately million in connection with certain severance agreements for terminated employees 
approximately  million of this charge was included in employee severance expense in connection with our plan to reduce worldwide headcount and the remaining million was included in stock based expenses 
during  we incurred a stock based charge of approximately million in connection with a severance agreement for a terminated employee 
this expense was charged to cost of net revenues based on the employee s function 
warrants 
during and  we issued warrants to purchase shares of our preferred and common stock pursuant to certain strategic agreements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements shareholders equity 
we believe that these warrant agreements could have a significant current and potential future impact on our results of operations 
in january  we entered into an agreement with icq  inc  a subsidiary of aol time warner  pursuant to which we provide email hosting services that are integrated with icq s instant messaging service provided to icq s customers 
as part of the agreement  icq agreed to provide sub branded advertising for critical path in exchange for a warrant to purchase  shares of series b preferred stock  issuable upon attainment of each of five milestones 
as of april   all five milestones had been attained and the final revised aggregate fair value of all vested warrants was million  which is being amortized to advertising expense using the straight line method over four years 
aggregate charges recorded to stock based expenses were million during and million during there were no related stock based expenses recorded during in connection with our review of our fourth quarter financial results  we recorded an impairment charge of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets 
the adjusted fair value at december   of approximately million will be amortized over the remaining benefit period of three years 
in october  we entered into an agreement with qwest communications corporation  a telecommunications company  pursuant to which we will provide email hosting services to qwest s customers 
as part of the agreement  qwest agreed to provide sub branded advertising for us in exchange for a warrant to purchase up to a maximum of  shares of common stock upon attainment of each of six milestones 
in october  the first of the six milestones had been attained and the final revised aggregate fair value of the vested warrants associated with the first milestone approximated million  which is being amortized to advertising expense using the straight line method over three years 
none of the remaining milestones are considered probable and as a result  the fair value of the warrants relating to the shares underlying the second through sixth milestones has not been recognized 
aggregate charges recorded to stock based expenses were million during and million during in connection with our review of our fourth quarter financial results  we recorded an impairment charge of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets 
the adjusted fair value at december   of approximately million will be amortized over the remaining benefit period of two years 
in december  we entered into an agreement with worldsport network ltd  the sole and exclusive provider of internet solutions for the general association of international sports federations or gaisf and a majority of the international federations it recognizes 
under the terms of the agreement  worldsport offers critical path s web based email and calendaring services to the entire gaisf network and its members 
as part of the agreement  worldsport agreed to provide sub branded advertising for critical path in exchange for warrants to purchase up to a equity interest in critical path on a fully diluted basis upon attainment of each of five milestones based on the number of email boxes for which worldsport registers and provides sub branding 
the warrants are exercisable for five years after becoming vested 
any warrants not vested within five years of the date of the agreement will be cancelled 
as of december   worldsport had filed for bankruptcy and accordingly  none of the milestones were considered probable and no deferred compensation associated with these warrants was recognized 
in december  we entered into an agreement with one of our lessors  in connection with an office lease  pursuant to which the lessor is entitled to purchase up to a maximum of  shares of our common stock 
the warrants may be exercised beginning january  through december  at a price of per share 
the warrants vest at the beginning of each month on a straight line basis in the amount of shares per month 
the fair value of approximately million is being amortized to general and administrative expenses using the straight line method over years 
during   was charged to stock based expense related to the vested warrants 
no amounts were charged to stock based expense related to the vested warrants during in january  the docspace company entered into an agreement with a major telecommunications company telco pursuant to which docspace would provide secure messaging services to the telco s customers 
as part of the agreement  telco agreed to provide marketing  publicity  and promotional services to docspace 
as a result of the completion of our acquisition of docspace  critical path assumed warrants that allowed telco to purchase up to a maximum of  shares of critical path common stock upon attainment of each of three milestones 
subsequent to the acquisition  we entered into discussions with telco to modify our relationship 
accordingly  we believe the vesting provisions of the proposed agreement will be modified to reflect the requirements of the new relationship 
as of december   none of the vesting milestones of the original agreement had been attained  however  we believe that all shares underlying these warrants are probable of issuance 
as a result  the shares underlying these milestones were remeasured  resulting in a revised fair value of the warrants of million 
as of december   no amounts had been recognized as stock based expense related to these warrants 
we expect that future changes in the trading price of our common stock at the end of each quarter  and at the time certain milestones are achieved  will cause additional substantial changes in the ultimate amount of the related stock based charges 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of isocor and peerlogic during  we recognized million representing the value attributable to acquired in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
these values were determined by estimating the future net cash flows of the acquired in process research and development over their respective estimated useful life and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
no amounts were recognized resulting from acquired in process research and development during and employee severance expenses on july   we announced our plan to reduce our worldwide employee headcount by approximately 
this employee reduction plan was executed with the intent to realize various synergies gained through the nine acquisitions we completed in and the first half of during  we recognized a charge for severance related costs totaling approximately million  composed of million in cash charges and million in stock based compensation expense  resulting from the acceleration of certain employee stock options 
impairment of long lived assets as part of our review of our fourth quarter financial results  an impairment assessment of our long lived assets was performed 
the assessment was performed primarily due to the significant decline in our stock price  the net book value of assets significantly exceeding our market capitalization  the significant underperformance of certain acquisitions relative to projections  the overall decline of growth rates in the industry  and our lower fourth quarter and projected operating results compared to earlier forecasts 
as a result  we recorded a billion impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets and deferred costs associated with our icq and qwest relationships in the fourth quarter of to their estimated fair values 
the estimates of their fair values were based upon our estimated discounted cash flows for the succeeding three years using a discount rate of and an estimated terminal value 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rate and estimated terminal value  were determined using management s best estimates 
the discount rate was primarily based upon the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
the remaining goodwill and identifiable intangibles balance of approximately million will be amortized over the remaining useful lives  which approximates two years 
these remaining identifiable intangible assets primarily relate to existing technology for some of the licensed products we acquired in and certain amounts related to assembled work forces acquired in and the aggregate adjusted fair value at december   relative to the icq and qwest warrants  approximates million and will be amortized over the remaining relative benefit periods of between two and three years 
interest and other income expense interest and other income expense consists primarily of interest earnings on cash and cash equivalents as well as net realized gains losses on foreign exchange transactions 
we completed private placements of equity securities in april  september  and january  and we completed public offerings of common stock in april and june in addition  on march   we issued million of five year  convertible subordinated notes due april  as a result  interest income increased significantly during the latter half of and into  in comparison with early  due to higher cash balances available for investing 
during  we recognized a net loss from foreign currency transactions associated with our international operations in the amount of  foreign currency transaction gain or loss were insignificant during and interest expense interest expense consists primarily of the interest and amortization of related issuance costs related to the convertible subordinated notes we issued in march  the amortization of related issuance costs and interest on certain capital leases 
we incurred approximately million in interest expense on the convertible subordinated notes  and approximately million related to amortization of debt issuance costs in interest on capital leases and other long term obligations amounted to approximately million during   during  and  during additionally  amortization of stock based charges associated with warrants issued in connection with various of our financings in and  amounted to  during   during and  during equity in net loss of critical path pacific in june  we established a joint venture  critical path pacific  with mitsui and co  ltd  ntt communications corporation and nec corporation to deliver advanced internet messaging solutions to businesses in asia 
we invested million and hold a ownership interest in the joint venture 
this investment is being accounted for using the equity method 
during  we recorded equity in net loss of joint venture of approximately million 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary as of december   we owned a interest in cp italia  a consolidated subsidiary  which was acquired in connection with the acquisition of isocor 
for  the minority interest in net income of cp italia amounted to  in march  in connection with our agreement to purchase the remaining minority interest  we acquired the outstanding interest in cp italia for approximately million 
loss on investments during  we determined that certain of our investments were permanently impaired and recorded write downs of million  consisting of million in investments in marketable securities and million in investments in non marketable securities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements investments 
provision for income taxes no current provision or benefit for us federal or state income taxes has been recorded as we have incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes since our inception 
no deferred provision or benefit for federal or state income taxes has been recorded as we are in a net deferred tax asset position for which a full valuation allowance has been provided due to uncertainty of realization 
we recognized a provision for foreign income taxes during as certain of our european operations generated income taxable in certain european jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources during and  we invested our cash primarily in money market funds and other highly liquid securities with maturities of less than days with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes 
beginning in  we have begun investing a portion of our cash in high grade  low risk investments with an average maturity of months 
as of december   our cash balance was million and our working capital amounted to approximately million 
we used cash to fund operating activities during primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash charges  severance expense and acquisition related retention bonus payments 
these disbursements related primarily to compensation for our employees 
in addition  we used cash to fund various other operating costs  which are identified in the results of operations portion of this section 
during  we used cash to fund operating activities  primarily related to compensation for our employees 
the large increase in cash used in operations from to was predominantly caused by the increase in employees and facilities resulting from our numerous acquisitions and to a lesser extent the operating costs of the new products and services acquired 
we used cash in investing activities during to purchase property  equipment and other capital expenditures and to fund certain strategic acquisitions and investments 
the significant outlay in capital expenditures during was primarily related to installation of additional network infrastructure equipment in our data centers  licenses of new software platforms  and purchases of furniture and equipment for new employees 
during  we completed our acquisitions of isocor  docspace  remarq  netmosphere  and peerlogic  and as a result  expended a significant amount of capital 
in addition  we made several strategic investments in private entities and an initial capital contribution to fund our interest in the critical path pacific joint venture 
we advanced funds to certain employees pursuant to promissory notes 
these uses of cash were offset by the repayment of a previous advance to a private company pursuant to a promissory note and certain of the employee notes 
during  we disbursed capital to purchase property and equipment  expended significant capital related to our acquisitions  advanced funds to obtain equity positions in strategic partners  and issued notes to certain employees and officers 
we received cash proceeds from financing activities during from the sale of million in convertible subordinated notes  as well as from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
these cash proceeds were partially offset by a payment to retire a note payable assumed in the peerlogic acquisition and payments to retire principal on capital lease obligations 
during  we received cash proceeds from the sale of our preferred stock  the closing of our initial public offering of common stock  and closing of our follow on offering of common stock 
these increases in cash in were offset by a payment to retire principal on capital lease obligations and the purchase of treasury stock 
liquidity since inception  we have incurred substantial costs as a result of the rapid expansion of our product offerings and network infrastructure during and we continue to face significant risks associated with successful execution of our business strategy 
these risks include  but are not limited to  technology and product development  introduction and market acceptance of new products and services  changes in the marketplace  liquidity  competition from existing and new competitors which may enter the marketplace  retention of key personnel  and pending litigation 
we require sufficient capital to implement our strategy  to adequately address the appropriate target markets  generate sales demand for our current and planned future products and services 
in addition  our liquidity could be adversely impacted by the litigation referred to in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies  although we believe the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on working capital through the end of we believe  based on the available cash balances  we have sufficient cash resources to fund operations through at least the end of on a long term basis  however  we may require additional financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such financing would be available when needed  if at all  or on favorable terms and conditions 
additional factors that may affect future operating results we have a history of losses  expect continuing losses and may never achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit  including other comprehensive income  of approximately billion 
we have not achieved profitability in any period  and expect to continue to incur net losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the foreseeable future 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to spend resources on building our business and that this increase may have a negative effect on operating results and financial condition in the near term 
we have spent heavily on technology and infrastructure development 
we may continue to spend substantial financial and other resources to develop and introduce new end to end internet messaging infrastructure products and services  and improve our sales and marketing organizations  strategic relationships and operating infrastructure 
in addition  in future periods we will continue to incur significant non cash charges related to the ten acquisitions we completed in and and stock based compensation 
we expect that our cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  operations and customer support expenses  and depreciation and amortization expenses could continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percent of revenues 
if revenues do not correspondingly increase  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
should we continue to incur net losses in future periods  we may not be able to retain employees  fund investments in capital equipment  sales and marketing programs  and research and development to successfully compete against our competitors 
we may never obtain sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability in the future 
this may  in turn  cause our stock price to decline 
due to our limited operating history  evolving business strategy and the emerging nature of the internet messaging infrastructure market  future revenues are unpredictable  and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
we cannot accurately forecast our revenues as a result of our limited operating history  evolving business strategy and the emerging nature of the internet messaging infrastructure market 
forecasting is further complicated by rapid changes in our business due to the ten acquisitions we completed in and  as well as a related increase in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues from an insignificant percentage in to in our revenues could fall short of expectations if we experience delays or cancellations of even a small number of orders 
we often offer volume based pricing  which may affect operating margins 
a number of factors are likely to cause fluctuations in operating results  including  but not limited to continued growth of the internet in general and the use of messaging infrastructure products and services in particular  demand for outsourced messaging services  demand for licensing of messaging  directory  and other products  our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain customer satisfaction  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with internet industry expertise  particularly sales and marketing personnel  the reaction of our customers and potential customers to our ongoing integration of acquired businesses  our ability to upgrade  develop and maintain our systems and infrastructure  the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of business and infrastructure  our ability to effectively respond to the rapid technology change of the internet messaging infrastructure market  technical difficulties or system outages  and the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced services by competitors 
in addition to the factors set forth above  operating results will be impacted by the extent to which we incur non cash charges associated with stock based arrangements with employees and non employees 
in particular  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial non cash charges associated with the grant of stock options to employees and non employees and the grant of warrants to our customers and other parties with which we have commercial relationships 
these grants of options and warrants also may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
our operating results also could be impacted by a decision to eliminate a product or service offering through termination  sale or other disposition or to sustain certain products and services at a minimum level where customer commitments prevent us from eliminating the offering altogether 
we are currently evaluating our various products  services  facilities and the business plan under which we are operating  and each of the foregoing alternatives is under consideration 
any decision to eliminate or limit our offering of a product or service could involve the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  a reduction in workforce  facility consolidation  and or the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs  any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
as a result of the foregoing  period to period comparisons of operating results are not a good indication of future performance 
it is likely that operating results in some quarters will be below market expectations 
in this event  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
pending litigation could seriously harm our business 
since february  various of our shareholders have filed separate lawsuits against us  our independent accountants and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business and financial condition 
in particular  the lawsuits could harm our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
the continued defense of the lawsuits also could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payment could seriously harm our financial condition 
most of the lawsuits could have been filed as purported class actions by persons who claim that they purchased our common stock during a purported class period 
the complaints generally allege that we and the other named defendants made false or misleading statements of material fact about our financial statements  including our revenues  revenue recognition practices  business operations and prospects for the year and beyond 
the complaints  in general  do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
we have not set aside any financial reserves relating to potential damages associated with any of these lawsuits 
limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may harm our business 
our liability insurance for actions taken by officers and directors during the period from march to march  the period during which events related to securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of our current and former executive officers are alleged to have occurred  provide only limited liability protection 
if these policies do not adequately cover our expenses related to those lawsuits  our business and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
under california law  in connection with our charter documents and indemnification agreements we entered into with our executive officers and directors  we must indemnify our current and former officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law 
the indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with the investigation  defense  settlement or appeal of legal proceedings 
the pending securities and exchange commission investigation could harm our business 
in february  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued a formal order of investigation of us and certain unidentified individuals associated with us 
the investigation relates to non specified accounting matters  financial reports  other public disclosures and trading activity in our stock 
while we do not know the current status of the investigation or any possible actions that may be taken against us as a result  any negative developments with respect to the investigation or any sec action against us could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline significantly 
we have experienced and may continue to experience turnover of senior management and key personnel  which could harm our business and operations 
we are currently engaged in a search for a chief executive officer 
our success depends on our ability to recruit and hire a chief executive officer 
if we are not able to successfully recruit a chief executive officer our business will be seriously harmed 
additionally  the loss of the services of key personnel could harm our business results 
our success depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales and marketing  operational  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for these people is intense  and we may not be able to successfully recruit  train or retain qualified personnel 
in february  we announced a series of changes in critical path management 
david hayden  our chairman and a founder  was appointed our executive chairman of the board of directors and asked to take a greater role in the day to day operations of the company 
a search for a new chief executive officer currently is ongoing  following the resignation of doug hickey from his position as chief executive officer 
diana whitehead  formerly our vice president of engineering and operations  was promoted to president  following david thatcher s resignation from critical path 
additionally  mari tangredi  formerly our vice president of corporate development  has been named executive vice president of business development  sales and professional services  following william rinehart s resignation from critical path 
it is possible that this high turnover at our senior management levels will continue and that other senior executive officers also will resign 
additionally  our management team has not worked together for a significant length of time and may not be able to work together effectively to successfully implement our strategy 
if the management team is unable to accomplish our business objectives  our ability to grow our business could be severely impaired 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our executive officers and key personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
the loss of the services of one or more of our current senior executive officers or key personnel could harm our business and affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
we will face technical  operational and strategic challenges that may prevent us from successfully continuing the integration of any businesses we have acquired 
acquisitions involve risks related to the integration and management of acquired technology  operations and personnel 
the integration of businesses that we have acquired into our business has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process  which may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
we must operate as a combined organization utilizing  common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices to be successful 
in particular  we are currently evaluating  upgrading or replacing our financial information systems and establishing uniformity among the systems of the acquired businesses 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating the operations of our subsidiaries  including potential incompatibility of business cultures  perceived adverse changes in business focus  and potential failure in effectively managing our rapid growth in personnel 
consequently  we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
we also cannot guarantee that these acquisitions will result in sufficient revenues or earnings to justify our investment in  or expenses related to  these acquisitions or that any synergies will develop 
if we are not successful in integrating acquired businesses or if expected earnings or synergies do not materialize  we could be forced to attempt to resell or cease operations of acquired businesses 
in either event  we would likely incur significant expenses as well as non cash charges to write off acquired assets  which could seriously harm our financial condition and operating results 
in this regard  in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a billion impairment charge to reduce the value of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the ten acquisitions we completed in and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements quarterly financial data unaudited 
further  due in part to the significant underperformance of certain acquisitions relative to projections  we are currently reviewing the products and services we sell to customers  the locations in which we operate and the manner in which we go to market with our core product and service offerings 
ultimately  we may decide to eliminate certain acquired product or service offerings through termination  sale or other disposition or to sustain certain products and services at a minimum level where customer commitments prevent us from eliminating the offering altogether 
any decision to eliminate or limit our offering of an acquired product or service could involve the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  a reduction in workforce  facility consolidation  and or the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs  any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
further acquisitions could result in dilution  operating difficulties and other consequences 
since january  we have completed the acquisition of ten companies for an aggregate consideration consisting of cash  common stock and the assumption of stock options and warrants totaling approximately billion 
we may continue to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products  services and technologies that complement or augment our products and services offerings and customer base 
we cannot guarantee that we will not engage in discussions with companies regarding strategic acquisitions  investments or partnerships 
we would expect to pay for acquisitions or investments by issuing additional common stock  which would dilute current shareholders  or by using cash 
in connection with an acquisition or investment  it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds at any particular point in the future or on favorable terms 
in addition  we may be required to amortize significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions  which would materially increase operating expenses 
if we fail to improve sales and marketing activities  we may be unable to improve our business 
our ability to increase revenues will depend on our ability to successfully recruit  train and retain sales and marketing personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to hire and retain personnel with relevant experience 
the complexity and implementation of our internet messaging infrastructure products and services require highly trained sales and marketing personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our services 
current and prospective customers  in turn  must be able to educate their end users 
any delays or difficulties encountered in our staffing efforts would impair our ability to attract new customers and enhance our relationships with existing customers 
this in turn would adversely impact the timing and extent of revenues 
because we have experienced high turnover in our sales force and the majority of our current sales and marketing personnel have recently joined us and have limited experience working together  our sales and marketing organizations may not be able to compete successfully against the sales and marketing organizations of our competitors 
if we do not successfully operate our sales and marketing activities  our business could suffer and our stock price could decline 
our reserves may be insufficient to cover bills we are unable to collect 
we assume a certain level of credit risk with our customers in order to do business 
conditions affecting any of our customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner  or at all  for products or services we have already provided them 
in the past  we have experienced significant collection delays from certain customers  and we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays 
in particular  a portion of our customers are suffering from the general weakness in the economy and among technology companies in particular 
although we have established reserves that we believe are sufficient to cover losses due to delays in or inability to pay  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be sufficient to cover such losses 
if losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than our reserves  it could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully address the risks inherent in the expansion of our international operations  our business could suffer 
during  we expanded our international operations significantly 
we derived of our revenue from international sales in compared to an insignificant amount in we intend to continue to operate in international markets and to spend significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
if revenues from international operations do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations  our business  financial condition and operating results will suffer 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and imposition of currency exchange controls  differing technology standards  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including us export restrictions on encryption technologies  political and economic instability  potentially adverse tax consequences  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
any of these factors could harm our international operations and  consequently  our business and consolidated operating results 
specifically  failure to successfully manage international growth could result in higher operating costs than anticipated  or could delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in key international markets 
unplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints could reduce our ability to provide messaging services and could harm our business reputation 
our customers have  in the past  experienced some interruptions in our messaging service 
we believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions are due to hardware failures  unsolicited bulk email  or spam  attacks and operating system failures 
our business will suffer if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of systems or networks or reduce our ability to provide email services 
we expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  impaired quality and degradation in levels of customer service 
if this were to continue to happen  our business and reputation could suffer dramatically 
we have entered into messaging agreements with some customers that require minimum performance standards  including standards regarding the availability and response time of messaging services 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers could terminate their relationships with us and we could be subject to contractual monetary penalties 
unknown software defects could disrupt our services and harm our business and reputation 
our software products are inherently complex 
additionally  our service offerings depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we may not discover software defects in our products or that affect new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although we have not experienced any material software defects to date  it is possible that  despite testing  defects may occur in the software 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage our reputation or increase service costs  cause us to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert development resources  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
we may need additional capital and raising additional capital may dilute existing shareholders 
we believe that existing capital resources will enable us to maintain current and planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may be required to raise additional funds due to unforeseen circumstances 
if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
such financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
the trading prices and volumes of our stock have been volatile and we expect that this volatility will continue 
our stock price and trading volumes have been highly volatile since our initial public offering on march  we expect that this volatility will continue in the future due to factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in results of operations and changes in or failure to meet market expectations 
for example  in february  after we announced a revision of our fourth quarter results of operations  our stock was suspended from trading on nasdaq for a period of time  and subsequently the market price of our stock declined 
in addition  the stock market itself is experiencing and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the stocks of technology companies  particularly internet companies 
these broad market fluctuations may continue to result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
we depend on strategic relationships and other sales channels and the loss of certain strategic relationships could harm our business and our revenues 
we depend on strategic relationships to expand distribution channels and to undertake joint service and product development and marketing efforts 
our ability to increase revenues depends upon marketing services and products through new and existing strategic relationships 
we depend on a broad acceptance of internet messaging infrastructure services on the part of potential partners and acceptance of our company as the supplier for these internet messaging infrastructure services 
we also depend on joint marketing and product development through strategic relationships to achieve market acceptance and brand recognition 
if we lose any strategic relationships  fail to renew these agreements or relationships or fail to develop new strategic relationships  our business will suffer 
if our system security is breached  our business and reputation could suffer 
a fundamental requirement for online communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
if these attempts are successful  customers confidential information  including customers profiles  passwords  financial account information  credit card numbers or other personal information could be breached 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security and a breach could harm our reputation 
we rely on encryption technology licensed from third parties 
although we have implemented network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
failure to prevent security breaches may harm our business and operating results 
we may not be able to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success  and we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with employees  customers and partners to protect proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe or copy portions of our services or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
end user license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
the status of united states patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we have several patents pending in the united states and may seek additional patents in the future 
we do not know if the patent application or any future patent application will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents received will be challenged or invalidated 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop similar technology 
additionally  although we have not received notice of any other alleged patent infringement  we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents that may relate to our products 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our software products 
we may have liability for internet content and we may not have adequate liability insurance 
as a provider of messaging services  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted via our services 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by our users  and we could be exposed to liability with respect to this content 
furthermore  some foreign governments  such as germany  have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the united states 
although we carry general liability and umbrella liability insurance  our insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
there is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims  if successfully asserted against us  could exceed the total of our coverage limits 
there also is a risk that single claim or multiple claims asserted against us may not qualify for coverage under our insurance policies as a result of coverage exclusions that are contained within these policies 
should either of these risks occur  capital contributed by our shareholders may need to be used to settle claims 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our reputation and business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of common stock  prohibit shareholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at a meeting 
in march  we adopted a shareholder rights plan or poison pill 
this plan could cause the acquisition of our company by a party not approved by our board of directors to be prohibitively expensive

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of available for sale securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements investments 
these securities consist of strategic equity investments in corporate partners  certain of which are publicly traded and marketable and certain of which are privately held 
these securities are subject to equity price risk 
the company has not attempted to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these equity securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the impairment of certain of these investments was deemed to be other than temporary and recorded a write down of million  consisting of million in investments in marketable securities and million in investments in non marketable securities 
for each decline in market value of its available for sale equity securities from december   the company s marketable securities would decline in value by million 
the company s long term obligations consist of the company s million five year  convertible subordinated notes due april  and certain fixed rate capital leases 
accordingly  an immediate change in interest rates would not affect the company s long term obligations or the company s results of operations 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a significant portion of our worldwide operations has a functional currency other than the united states dollar 
accordingly  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities of these operations 
fluctuations in exchange rates may harm our results of operations and could also result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rates fluctuations cannot be predicted adequately 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
