item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
overview consumer portfolio services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  the company primarily engage in the business of purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts contracts originated by automobile dealers dealers located throughout the united states 
in the past  the company has purchased contracts in as many as different states 
at various times in  the company suspended its solicitation of contract purchases in as many as states  and as of the date of this report is active in states 
there can be no assurance as to resumption of contract purchasing activities in other states 
through its purchase of contracts  the company provides indirect financing to dealer customers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems  who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers captive finance companies 
the company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  and interest earned on residuals as defined below and on contracts held for sale 
beginning with the year ended december   and through the date of this report  the company did not sell any contracts in securitization transactions  and therefore recognized no gains on sale 
all sales of contracts during were on a servicing released basis either in the form of bulk sales of contracts being held by the company for sale  or as part of a pass through agreement with a third party for which the company earned fees on a per contract basis 
during the year ended december   the company entered into a second third party pass through agreement and proceeded to sell nearly all of the contracts purchased during the year to one or the other third party  for a mark up above what the company pays the dealer 
there were no bulk sales during as a result of the company s pass through sales during the year ended december   the company recognized a million gain on sale of contracts  compared to a net loss on sale of contracts for the year ended december   of million 
during the year ended december   the company recognized a net gain on sale of million 
revenues from interest and servicing fees for the year ended december   were million and million  respectively 
such revenues for the year ended december   were million and million  respectively  and for the year ended december   such revenues were million and million  respectively 
the company s income is affected by losses incurred on contracts  whether such contracts are held for sale or have been sold in securitizations 
the company s cash requirements have been significant in the past and will continue to be significant in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately million  compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately  for the year ended december   and net cash used in operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  see liquidity and capital resources 
the company has purchased contracts with the primary intention of reselling them in securitization transactions as asset backed securities 
from late may to the present  the company has purchased contracts on a flow basis for third parties  that is  the company purchases a contract from a dealer  and sells the contract the next day to the third party for a mark up above what the company pays the dealer 
the company retains no interest in such contracts  and neither services such contracts nor earns a servicing fee 
although the company has not been able to sell contracts in a securitization transaction since december  it does plan to securitize in the future  as to which there can be no assurance 
the company s securitization structure has been as follows first  the company sells a portfolio of contracts to a wholly owned subsidiary sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to either a grantor trust or an owner trust the trust 
the trust in turn issues interest bearing asset backed securities the certificates  generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the certificates issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the certificates are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior certificates  from an insurance company the certificate insurer 
in addition  the company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the certificate insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account spread account held by the trust 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the servicing agreements require that the initial deposits to the spread accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the spread accounts reach specified levels  and then maintained at those levels 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related certificates 
the specified levels at which the spread accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the certificate insurer and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios  and have also been varied by agreement 
the specified levels applicable to the company s sold pools increased materially in effective november   as applied to monthly measurement dates from september onward  the specified levels have decreased  as is discussed under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
at the closing of each securitization  the company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in the contracts sold in the securitization 
that retained interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account and b the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received by the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the certificates  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the certificates and the residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value and accounted for as held for trading securities 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows released from the spread account the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
for that valuation  the company has used an effective discount rate of approximately per annum 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the residuals that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the certificates  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
at the end of each collection period  the aggregate cash collections from the contracts are allocated first to the base servicing fees and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees for the period  then to the certificateholders for interest at the pass through rate on the certificates plus principal as defined in the servicing agreements 
if the amount of cash required for the above allocations exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is drawn from the spread account 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account  the excess is released to the company  or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts that may be below their specified levels 
pursuant to certain servicing agreements  excess cash collected during the period is used to make accelerated principal paydowns on certain certificates to create over collateralization  that is  to reduce the aggregate principal balance of outstanding certificates below the aggregate principal amount of the related automotive receivables 
if the spread account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the spread account until the specified level is achieved 
the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the servicing agreements 
spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company as the owner of the residuals 
the annual percentage rate payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the rates payable on the certificates 
accordingly  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals described above  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity  as they affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts 
the company has used a constant prepayment estimate of approximately per annum 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
in valuing the residuals  the company estimates that losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will range from to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
in future periods  the company could recognize additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts were to be better than originally estimated  or the company could increase the estimated fair value of the residuals 
if the actual performance of the contracts were to be worse than the original estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals would be required 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the future performance of the underlying contracts  the company has established a provision for future losses on the residuals 
from march to the present  the company has been unable to complete a securitization transaction  due to unavailability of sufficient capital 
the above description is included because the residuals created in past securitizations continue to represent the company s largest asset  and because the company plans again to sell contracts in securitization transactions  when necessary pre conditions including availability of capital are fulfilled 
during the year ended december   the company has altered its basic system of doing business 
previously  the company would acquire contracts for its own account  borrowing from to of the principal balance of such contracts under warehouse lines of credit 
periodically approximately once every quarter the company would then sell most or all of the recently acquired contracts in a securitization transaction as described above 
in such a sale  the company would retain a residual ownership interest in the contracts sold  the obligation to service the contracts sold  and the right to receive servicing fees 
at the end of march  the company learned that it would be unable to sell contracts in securitization transactions for an indeterminate period 
accordingly  the company commenced purchasing contracts for immediate re sale to a third party  which third party purchases the contracts in turn on a daily basis for a mark up above what the company pays the dealer 
in this arrangement  the company retains no residual interest in the contracts  has no servicing obligation  and receives no servicing fee 
in november  the company entered into a one year revolving note purchase facility under which up to million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to a collateral test and other conditions 
the company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase contracts  which are pledged to secure the notes 
such contracts are held for sale in anticipated future securitization transactions  as to which there can be no assurance 
the collateral test generally allows the company to borrow up to approximately of the price paid for such contracts 
notes issued under this facility bear interest at one month libor plus per annum 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  net gain on sale of contracts increased by million  from a million loss on sale for the year ended december   to a million gain for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase is that the prior year included sales of some million of contracts for less than their acquisition costs  resulting in a loss on sale of million 
net gain on sale also increased due to an increase in the number of contracts sold on a flow basis  and an increase in the average fee paid to the company per contract sold 
during the year ended december   the company sold million of contracts on a flow basis compared to million of contracts in the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  of provision for losses on contracts held for sale was charged against gain on sale 
interest income increased by  or  representing of total revenues for the year ended december  prior to the second quarter of the year  the company recognized residual interest income as the excess cash flows generated by the trusts over the related obligations of the trusts 
this method of residual interest income recognition approximated a level yield rate of residual interest income  net of the amortization of the nirs  primarily due to the continued addition of new securitizations 
as a result of the company s not having securitized any contracts since december  the company s existing method of amortizing the residuals would not reflect the appropriate level yield 
therefore  the company refined its methodology to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis  using an accretion rate that approximates the discount rate used to value the residual interest in securitizations 
that rate is per annum 
servicing fees decreased by million  or  and represented of total revenue 
servicing fees are composed of base fees  which are payable at the rate of per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding contracts in the related trusts  plus any other fees collected by the company  such as late fees and returned check fees 
the decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the company s servicing portfolio 
as of december   the servicing portfolio was million compared to million as of december  expenses 
during the year ended december   operating expenses decreased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  employee costs decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is due to the reductions of staff in accordance with the decrease in the company s servicing portfolio 
the decrease was offset by an increase in employee costs of  related to the valuation of certain stock options in accordance with recently issued accounting principles 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the company s portfolio 
such costs include telephone  postage  and lockbox processing fees 
interest expense decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reductions in warehouse and non warehouse indebtedness from the prior year 
see liquidity and capital resources 
marketing expenses increased by  or  and represented of total expenses 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in contracts purchased during the year ended december  fees paid to marketing representatives for their role in the submission of contracts ultimately purchased by the company are included as a component in gain on sale of contracts  net 
occupancy expenses increased by  or  and represented of total expenses 
the increase is primarily due to additional property taxes paid during depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total expenses 
in november  the company moved its headquarters to a new  square foot facility 
the company is leasing the new headquarters facility for a ten year term  with base rent of million for the first five years  and million for years six through ten 
in addition to base rent  the company pays property taxes  maintenance  and other expenses of the property 
the results for the years ended december  and  include net losses of  and net earnings of  respectively  from the company s subsidiary cps leasing  inc the results for the year ended december   include a net operating loss of  from the company s investment in of nab asset corp 
the results for the year ended december   include million in net earnings from the company s investment in nab asset corp 
the company s effective tax rate was and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in the effective tax rate in reflects the full utilization of net operating loss carryback availability  and the recording of a million valuation allowance on a portion of the company s net deferred tax assets 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
during the year ended december   revenue decreased million  or  compared to the year ended december  gain on sale of contracts  net  decreased by million  or  from a million gain on sale for the year ended december   to a million loss for the year ended december  the change in gain on sale from positive to negative is due to the company selling contracts only on a servicing released basis and thus not recording any nir gains during the year  as well as to selling contracts at a loss 
during the year ended december   the company sold million of contracts on a servicing released basis  that is  with no residual interest retained  with no servicing obligation  and with no right to receive a servicing fee 
those sales resulted in a net loss of approximately million 
expenses of approximately million were incurred related to previous securitization transactions  including the amortization of a warrant issued to the certificate insurer in november in addition  the company sold million of contracts on a flow through basis and received million of fees  which have been included as a component of gain on sale of contracts  net 
for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  of provision for losses on contracts held for sale were charged against gain on sale 
the increase in the provision for losses on contracts held for sale is primarily due to the company s inability to securitize contracts during as a result  contracts were held for sale for longer periods of time prior to being sold on a servicing released basis  thus requiring additional loss reserves 
interest income decreased by million  or  representing of total revenues for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to decreases in contracts held for sale and nirs during beginning in may  the company began to purchase contracts on a flow through basis and thus did not hold any additional contracts for sale since that time 
additionally  the company completed the final sale of contracts on a servicing released basis  other than those sold on a flow through basis  on september   leaving approximately million of contracts held for sale at the end of september and decreasing to million by year end 
servicing fees increased by million  or  and represented of total revenue 
servicing fees are composed of base fees  which are payable at the rate of per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding contracts in the related trusts  plus any other fees collected by the company  such as late fees and returned check fees 
the increase in servicing fees is primarily due to an increase in the fees other than base fees collected during during the year ended december   the company collected million of other servicing fees  an increase of over other servicing fees collected in the prior year

during the year ended december   operating expenses increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  employee costs increased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase is due to increases in salaries and wage rates 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with purchasing contracts such as credit reports 
during the year ended december   the company purchased million of contracts  compared to  million of contracts purchased in the prior year 
interest expense increased million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase is due in part to the interest paid on million in subordinated debt securities issued by the company in november  and million of additional subordinated debt securities issued during the year ended december  in addition  the interest rate on the million of subordinated debt issued in november  was increased from in to in april of interest expense was also affected by the volume of contracts held for sale  as well as by the company s cost of borrowed funds

liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of contracts and other operating activities 
the company s primary sources of cash from operating activities have been proceeds from sales of contracts  amounts borrowed under lines of credit  servicing fees on portfolios of contracts previously sold  customer payments of principal and interest on contracts held for sale  fees received from its flow purchase programs for origination of contracts  and releases of cash from spread accounts 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchases of contracts  repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise  operating expenses such as employee  interest  and occupancy expenses  the establishment of and further contributions to spread accounts  and income taxes 
internally generated cash may or may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash demands  depending on the performance of securitized pools which determines the level of releases from spread accounts  on the rate of growth or decline in the company s servicing portfolio  and on the terms on which the company is able to buy  borrow against and sell contracts 
contracts are purchased from dealers for a cash price close to their principal amount  and return cash over a period of years 
as a result  the company has been dependent on lines of credit to purchase contracts  and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continued operations  and to fund the portion of contract purchase prices not borrowed under lines of credit 
for much of the three year period ended december   the company was not party to any line of credit that would facilitate purchase of contracts 
furthermore  the company did not receive any material releases of cash from spread accounts from june through october the inability to borrow and the lack of cash releases resulted in a liquidity deficiency  which has since been alleviated 
the company s contract purchasing program currently comprises both i purchases for the company s own account  funded primarily by advances under a revolving credit facility  and ii flow purchases for the account of non affiliates 
flow purchases allow the company to purchase contracts with minimal demands on liquidity 
the company s revenues from flow purchase of contracts  however  are materially less than may be received by holding contracts to maturity or by selling contracts in securitization transactions 
for the year ended december   the company purchased million of contracts on a flow basis  and million for its own account  compared to million of contracts purchased  million of which was purchased on a flow basis  in the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the same period in the prior year 
during the years ended december   and  the company did not complete a securitization transaction  and therefore  did not use any cash for initial deposits to spread accounts 
cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of million  or  from cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts for the prior year 
cash released from spread accounts to the company for the year ended december   was million  as compared with million for the prior year 
changes in deposits to and releases from spread accounts are affected by the relative size  seasoning and performance of the various pools of sold contracts that make up the company s servicing portfolio 
in particular  in the prior year most of the cash generated by contracts held by the trusts was directed  pursuant to the securitization agreements  to building spread accounts to their respective specified levels 
those levels having been reached in november  cash subsequently generated has been available for release to the company 
from june to november  the company s liquidity was adversely affected by the absence of releases from spread accounts 
such releases did not occur because a number of the trusts had incurred cumulative net losses as a percentage of the original contract balance or average delinquency ratios in excess of the predetermined levels specified in the respective securitization agreements 
accordingly  pursuant to the securitization agreements  the specified levels applicable to the company s spread accounts were increased  in most cases to an unlimited amount 
due to cross collateralization provisions of the securitization agreements  the specified levels were increased on all but the two most recent of the company s trusts 
increased specified levels for the spread accounts have been in effect from time to time in the past 
as a result of the increased spread account specified levels and cross collateralization provisions  excess cash flows that would otherwise have been released to the company instead were retained in the spread accounts to bring the balance of those spread accounts up to higher levels 
in addition to requiring higher spread account levels  the securitization agreements provide the certificate insurer with certain other rights and remedies  some of which have been waived on a recurring basis by the certificate insurer with respect to all of the trusts 
until the november effectiveness of an amendment the amendment to the securitization agreements  no material releases from any of the spread accounts were available to the company 
upon effectiveness of the amendment  the requisite spread account levels in general have been set at of the outstanding principal balance of the certificates issued by the related trusts 
the level is subject to adjustment to reflect over collateralization 
older trusts may require more than of credit enhancement if the certificate balance has amortized to such a level that floor or minimum levels of credit enhancement are applicable 
in the event of certain defaults by the company  the specified level applicable to such credit enhancement could increase to an unlimited amount  but such defaults are narrowly defined  and the company does not anticipate suffering such defaults 
the amendment has been effective since november  and the company has received releases of cash from the securitized portfolio on a monthly basis thereafter 
the releases of cash are expected to continue and to vary in amount from month to month 
there can be no assurance that such releases of cash will continue in the future 
since november  the company has been able to purchase contracts for its own account using proceeds from a million revolving note purchase facility 
approximately of the acquisition cost of contracts may be advanced to the company under that facility see credit facilities 
the company also purchases contracts on a flow basis  which  as compared with purchase of contracts for the company s own account  involves a materially reduced demand on the company s cash 
cash requirements are reduced because the company need only fund such purchases for the period of several days that elapse between payment to the dealer and receipt of funds from the flow purchasers 
the company s plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to adjust its levels of contract purchases to match its availability of cash 
the company s ability to adjust the quantity of contracts that it purchases and sells will be subject to general competitive conditions and other factors 
there can be no assurance that the current level of contract acquisition can be maintained or increased 
obtaining releases of cash from the spread accounts is dependent on collections from the related trusts generating sufficient cash in excess of the amended specified levels 
there can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels 
credit facilities the terms on which credit has been available to the company for purchase of contracts have varied over the three year period ended december   as shown in the following recapitulation in november  the company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with general electric capital corporation the gecc line 
the gecc line provided for warehouse facility advances up to a maximum of million at a variable interest rate of libor 
the gecc line by its terms was to expire november  during  the company defaulted on the gecc line agreements and was required to repay all balances owed 
during august  all amounts owed under the gecc line were repaid and the agreement was terminated 
in november  the company entered into a warehouse line of credit agreement with first union capital markets first union line 
the first union line provided for a maximum of million of advances to the company  with interest at a variable rate indexed to prevailing commercial paper rates 
in july  the advance amount was increased to million 
in conjunction with the increase in maximum advance amount under the agreement  the expiration date was changed to july   renewable for one year with the mutual consent of the company and first union capital markets 
during  the company defaulted on the first union line agreement and was required to repay the balance outstanding in its entirety 
in june  the balance of the first union line was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated 
in december  the company entered into an overdraft financing facility  with a bank  that provided for maximum borrowings of million 
interest was charged on the outstanding balance at the bank s reference rate plus 
during  the overdraft facility was increased to million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  during  the company defaulted under the overdraft facility and was required to repay the outstanding balance in its entirety 
in november  the remaining balance outstanding under the overdraft facility was repaid in its entirety and the related agreement was terminated 
in november  the company entered into a revolving note purchase facility under which up to million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to a collateral test and other conditions 
the company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase contracts  which are pledged to secure the notes 
the collateral test generally allows the company to borrow up to approximately of the price paid for such contracts 
notes issued under this facility bear interest at one month libor plus per annum 
the balance of notes outstanding at december   was million 
capital resources in the past  the company funded the increase in its servicing portfolio through off balance sheet securitization transactions  as discussed above  and funded its other capital needs with cash from operations and with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and or equity 
the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases other than flow purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on sold contracts 
the company plans to adjust its levels of contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from spread accounts with capital requirements for securitization of contracts that are purchased for the company s own account 
capitalization over the three year period ended december   the company has increased its capitalization by issuing and restructuring debt and issuing repurchasing common stock and equivalents which is summarized in the following table for the years ended december  in thousands senior secured debt beginning balance   issuances   payments   restructuring  ending balance    subordinated debt beginning balance    issuances   payments   restructuring  ending balance    related party debt beginning balance    issuances   ending balance    increase decrease of common stock and equivalents 
  the following review of the terms of such issuances shows that the cost of such capital increased materially in  and then decreased somewhat in in april  the company borrowed million as a senior secured loan  which commenced amortization in may this loan bore interest at a rate equal to of per annum over libor 
cps borrowed million from related parties in august and september  the terms of which were renegotiated in november  in connection with the issuance of million of subordinated notes to levine leichtman capital partners ii  lp llcp 
the million of subordinated notes issued in november accrued interest at per annum  are due november  and were issued together with warrants that allowed the investor to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
as renegotiated  the million of related party loans are subordinated both to the company s general and secured creditors and also to the llcp subordinated notes  accrue interest at per annum  are due june  and are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
a related party also purchased million of company s common stock in july  at per share 
the cost of capital increased further in to meet a portion of its capital requirements  the company on april   issued million in subordinated notes to llcp the new llcp notes 
the notes bear interest at per annum and include warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
as part of the agreement to issue the new llcp notes  the company was required to restructure the terms of the million subordinated promissory notes discussed above 
such restructuring included an increase in the interest rate from to  a reduction in the number of warrants issued to purchase the company s common stock from  to  a waiver by llcp of certain defaults under the notes sold to llcp in november  and a reduction in the exercise price of the warrants from per share to per share 
among the agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of the new llcp notes were agreements by stanwich financial services corp 
sfsc  an affiliate of the chairman of the company s board of directors  to purchase an additional million of notes and of the company to sell such notes 
the terms of such notes were to be not less favorable to the company then i those that would be available in a transaction with a non affiliate  and ii those applicable to the new llcp notes 
in august and september  the company issued million of such notes  bearing interest at per annum  to sfsc 
as part of that transaction  the company also agreed to issue to sfsc warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
in march  the company and llcp restructured the outstanding indebtedness of the company in favor of llcp  which had been in default 
in the restructuring i all existing defaults were waived or cured  ii llcp lent an additional million tranche a to the company  iii the proceeds of that loan net of fees and expenses were used to repay all of the company s outstanding senior secured indebtedness  iv the outstanding million of subordinated indebtedness in favor of llcp was exchanged for senior indebtedness tranche b  v the company granted a blanket security interest in favor of llcp  to secure both tranche a and tranche b  and vi llcp released sfsc and its affiliates including mr 
bradley  sr  mr 
bradley  jr  and mr 
poole  directors of the company of any liability for failure to invest million in the company 
tranche a is due june  and bears interest at per annum  tranche b is due november  and bears interest at per annum 
in each case the interest rate is subject to increase by in the event of a default by the company 
in the restructuring  the company paid a fee of  paid accrued default interest of  issued  shares of common stock to llcp  and paid out of pocket expenses of approximately  the shares of common stock issued were valued at approximately  which is included in deferred interest expense to be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk there have been no significant changes in interest rate risk since december  the company is not currently issuing interest bearing asset backed securities nor is it holding any material amount of contracts for sale 
all contracts purchased are primarily sold on a flow basis  for a mark up above what the company pays the dealer 
therefore  any strategies the company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk do not apply currently 
described below are strategies the company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk 
the strategies the company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk include offering only fixed rate contracts to obligors  regular sales of contracts to the trusts  and pre funding securitizations  whereby the amount of asset backed securities issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts 
in pre funding  the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until the company sells the additional contracts to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  the company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts it subsequently delivers to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding 
the company is subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through its outstanding indebtedness and to a lesser extent its outstanding interest earning assets  and commitments to enter into new contracts 
the interest rate and maturity profile of the company s indebtedness is outlined above see capitalization and included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below outlines the carrying values and estimated fair values of such indebtedness as of december  and december  carrying fair carrying fair financial instrument value value value value in thousands warehouse lines of credit   notes payable     senior secured debt     subordinated debt     related party debt     much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective 
when applicable  readily available market information has been utilized 
however  for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  active markets do not exist 
therefore  considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items 
the subjective factors include  among other things  the estimated timing and amount of cash flows  risk characteristics  credit quality and interest rates  all of which are subject to change 
since the fair value is estimated as of december  and  the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different
