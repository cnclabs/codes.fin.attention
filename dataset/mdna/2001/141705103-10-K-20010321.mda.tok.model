overview the company is one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states 
the company s services assist employers  insurance companies  unions  government employee groups  managed care organizations and other health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in delivering prescription drugs in a cost effective manner 
the company s net revenue generally includes payments by its customers based on the price of prescription drugs dispensed to their members and administrative fees 
prescription drugs are dispensed from third party retail pharmacies included in one of the company s networks and from its own mail service pharmacies 
the preponderance of the company s revenue is earned on a fee for service basis through contracts covering one to three year periods 
revenues for selected types of services are earned based on a percentage of savings achieved or on a per enrollee or per member basis 
costs of revenues are comprised primarily of prescription drug acquisition costs and associated dispensing costs 
the company has added two large managed care contracts since the second quarter of  the largest of which began on january  the managed care contracts 
the addition of the managed care contracts resulted in higher revenues and higher average revenue per customer  however  the addition of these contracts also caused the company s gross margins gross profit as a percentage of net revenue to decrease 
managed care plans typically involve a higher concentration of retail pharmacy claims  which have lower gross margins than the company s mail service pharmacy claims 
the company anticipates that its gross margins will continue to decrease  but at a slower rate in the future  due to increased competitive pressures and changes in product mix 
the company had tax net operating loss nol carry forwards of approximately billion as of december  if not utilized to offset future taxable income  these nol carry forwards will expire on various dates through in addition to these nol carry forwards  the company has approximately million of future additional income tax deductions related to its discontinued operations 
the company also has a federal alternative minimum tax credit carry forward of approximately million  which may be used to offset its ordinary federal corporate income taxes in the future 
because of the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the company s net deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance has been established for the amount of the net deferred tax asset that is not otherwise expected to be used to offset deferred tax liabilities 
amounts reflected in income taxes payable on the company s consolidated balance sheets set forth elsewhere herein represent state taxes in those states where the company does not have state nol carry forwards

deferred income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes fas  the company is required to record a net deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carry forwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management has considered reversing deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
however  the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible and net operating losses can be carried forward 
management believes  considering all available information  including the company s history of earnings after adjustments for nonrecurring items  special charges  permanent differences  and other appropriate items and after considering appropriate tax planning strategies  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million  which is the amount of the deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance has been established due to the uncertainty of forecasting future taxable income 
discontinued operations discontinued operations loss for the year ended december   consists of charges totaling million million in march and million in december related to revised estimates of exit costs for the company s discontinued ppm operations

fas 
fas revised the standards for accounting for securitization transactions and other transfers and requires additional disclosures  however  it left intact most of the provisions of fasb statement no 
 under which the company has previously accounted for its accounts receivable securitization transactions 
fas is effective for all transfers and servicing of financial assets occurring after march   however  the expanded disclosure requirements of fas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and are reflected in note  trade receivable securitization to the company s audited consolidated financial statements which begin on page f of this annual report on form k 
the company will adopt the accounting requirements of fas on april   and does not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on its ability to market its services profitably  successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth

liquidity and capital resources general 
the company broadly defines liquidity as its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to meet its obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
currently  the company s liquidity needs arise primarily from the funding of its discontinued operations including the funding of any retained liabilities  as well as its working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and amounts available under the revolving facility as defined are sufficient to meet its liquidity needs 
cash flows 
the company s cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million and was used primarily to fund discontinued operations million  capital expenditures and contingent consideration paid for acquisitions million and repayments of amounts under the former credit facility 
in addition to the impact of factors discussed above for results of continuing operations for  the company s cash flow from operations was positively affected by increased focus on managing working capital  including improvements in inventory management and a reduction of days outstanding in accounts receivable 
additionally  days outstanding in accounts payable increased during the year ended december   primarily as a result of investment and maintenance inventory purchases made in the month of december 
due to significant new business starts on january   the company increased its december inventory purchases to ensure an adequate supply to meet this demand 
the company received approximately million in proceeds from the maturity of its taps during the majority of these proceeds were used to retire the company s million senior subordinated notes which became due on september  the remaining taps proceeds were used to reduce the company s indebtedness under the former credit facility  with million being applied to the former term loan facility as defined and the remainder being applied to the former revolving facility as defined

at december   the company had approximately million available for borrowing under the former revolving facility  exclusive of approximately million reserved under letters of credit 
borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on the london inter bank offered rate libor  plus varying margins 
at the company s option  or upon certain defaults or other events  borrowings under the credit facility may instead bear interest based on the prime rate plus varying margins 
the credit facility provides for net cash proceeds received from certain asset sales to be used to reduce the outstanding debt under the term loan facility 
the company is also required to repay the term loan facility with of the net cash proceeds received from certain issuances of equity or debt  and with of the excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility for each year

the indenture for the senior notes contains  among other things  restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness  sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidation  merger and sale of assets 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by any subsidiary 
the indenture for the senior notes also contains restrictions on indebtedness secured by liens 
to comply with this covenant  the company has secured the senior notes on an equal and ratable basis with the credit facility 
convertible preferred securities 
in september  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary caremark rx capital trust i the trust  privately placed million shares million aggregate face value of shared preference redeemable securities convertible preferred securities 
the sole assets of the trust  which has no business operations apart from administration of the convertible preferred securities  are the convertible subordinated debentures of the company  maturing october   with principal amount of million the trust debentures 
the trust is the sole holder of the trust debentures 
each convertible preferred security may be converted  at the option of the holder  into shares of the company s common stock at the rate of shares of common stock for each convertible preferred security equivalent to a conversion price of per share of common stock 
the conversion of all convertible preferred securities would result in the company s issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
all convertible preferred securities outstanding on october   must be redeemed by the company  however  any or all of the convertible preferred securities may be redeemed at the option of the company beginning october   at prices ranging from to plus accumulated and unpaid dividends per convertible preferred security

the amended and restated facility increased the aggregate amount available thereunder from million to at least million and extended the term of the facility to january  discontinued operations 
cash used to fund the remaining net liabilities of discontinued operations and estimated exit costs  which are classified in current liabilities as other accrued expenses and liabilities  will be funded by cash flows from continuing operations and by the revolving facility 
the company believes that these sources will be sufficient to fund discontinued operations exit costs 
if they are not  the company would seek to enhance its liquidity position through further modifications to the credit facility  incurrence of additional indebtedness  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of securities 
although the company currently believes that one or more of such alternatives would be available to enhance liquidity  each such alternative is dependent upon future events  conditions and other matters outside of the company s control

the company s earnings and the market value of its fixed rate debt are subject to change as a result of movements in market interest rates 
at december   the company had million in long term debt subject to variable rates of interest 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of from the rate at december   would result in an increase in annual interest expense of million  presuming that indebtedness subject to variable interest rates remained constant 
the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined based on only the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s long term debt balances and do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment
