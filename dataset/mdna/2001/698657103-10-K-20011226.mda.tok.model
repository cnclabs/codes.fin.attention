item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
additional discussion and analysis related to fiscal year is contained in our quarterly reports on form q and our current reports on form k 
introduction by any measure  fiscal was a challenging time for our industry and american business in general 
our operating results were impacted by several factors including an economic downturn  which was particularly hard felt in the southeast  greater volatility in wholesale gasoline markets and increased competition in selected markets 
throughout fiscal  we focused our attention on those aspects of our business we could influence in the face of these difficult economic and market conditions 
we are committed to taking the necessary steps to best position the pantry for when the business climate improves and to sensibly invest capital to maintain short term liquidity and improve long term performance 
in fiscal  our net income before unusual charges was million  or cents per share our net loss after these charges was million or cents per share  compared to cents per share in fiscal during the year  we recognized million in restructuring and other unusual charges related to i our restructuring plan announced in january and discussed in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and other charges and ii the impact of fair market value changes in non qualifying derivatives relating to the adoption of sfas no 
discussed in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note interest expense together the unusual charges 
the decrease in our earnings before the unusual charges is primarily attributable to softening consumer spending  tighter gasoline margins and the loss of south carolina video gaming income 
as a result of these factors  fiscal ebitda declined to million and income from operations before the unusual charges declined percent to million 
on january   we announced plans to centralize and integrate corporate administrative functions into our primary support center located in sanford  north carolina 
our restructuring plan reduced a number of administrative positions  eliminated our primary florida administrative facility located in jacksonville and reduced duplicative expenses 
we expect these activities to generate approximately million in annualized savings beginning in fiscal in conjunction with these actions  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges in fiscal we believe the integration provides a more efficient and cost effective administrative support structure and  more importantly  enhances the level of service our support functions provide to our field staff and extensive retail network 
fiscal revenues increased to billion 
the increase is primarily attributable to the contribution from acquired stores and a increase in our average retail gasoline price per gallon 
comparable store gasoline gallon volume declined and comparable store merchandise sales declined 
we believe these declines are indicative of the short term impact that sustained economic weakness and higher gasoline retail prices have had on the disposable income and spending habits of our customers 
we continue to focus our attention on several key operating principles 
the consistent execution of our core strategies  including focused attention on leveraging the quality of our growing retail network in terms of revenues  product costs and operating expenses  
the continuous effort to apply technology in all facets of our business  
our research and investment in new merchandise programs and 
sensible store growth in existing and contiguous markets 
when economic conditions improve  we believe our extensive retail network  merchandise programs  purchasing leverage and in store execution will allow us to improve merchandise and gasoline gallon comparable store sales  support stable merchandise margins and control store operating expenses 
we continue to focus attention and resources on upgrading existing and acquired locations with the latest gasoline marketing technology and designing site plans to drive customer traffic 
we will continue to invest in retail and gasoline information technology to enhance decision support tools  improve inventory management and reduce overhead costs 
on the merchandise front  we continue to maintain a fresh and open approach to convenience  focusing on products and services designed to appeal to the convenience needs of today s time constrained consumer 
we are constantly reviewing opportunities to get the most out of our retail network now at more than  stores located in southeastern states 
we have focused our attention on increasing ancillary or complementary services and revenues such as food service sales  lottery commissions  prepaid cellular services  phone cards  car wash offerings and other service revenues 
in fiscal we acquired stores  opened two and closed stores 
historically  the stores we close are under performing in terms of volume and profitability and  generally  we benefit from closing the locations by reducing direct overhead expenses and eliminating certain fixed costs 
given overall market conditions  we are currently being extremely prudent and have slowed down the pace of our acquisitions 
however  this does not represent a change in our long term strategic direction 
when the economic environment is once again favorable  we plan to continue to sensibly acquire premium chains located in our existing and contiguous markets 
in conclusion  we are focused mainly on the operations side of our business  working diligently to improve the overall productivity of our existing store base 
over the next twelve months  we anticipate reducing our average outstanding borrowings through scheduled principal payments and  where excess cash is available  allocating capital among available opportunities  including debt reduction 
acquisition history our acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring convenience stores within or contiguous to our existing market areas 
we believe acquiring locations with demonstrated operating results involves lower risk and is generally an economically attractive alternative to traditional site selection and new store development 
we do  however  plan to develop new locations in high growth areas within our existing markets 
the tables below provide information concerning the acquisitions we have completed during the last three fiscal years fiscal acquisitions trade date acquired name locations stores january  east coast north carolina and virginia december  fast lane mississippi and louisiana others less than five stores various north carolina  south carolina and mississippi total fiscal acquisitions date acquired trade name locations stores september  food mart mississippi july  mini mart south carolina june  big k mississippi april  market express south carolina january  on the way north carolina and southern virginia november  kangaroo georgia november  cel oil charleston  south carolina october  wicker mart north carolina others less than five stores various florida  north carolina  virginia  mississippi and south carolina total fiscal acquisitions date acquired trade name locations stores july  depot food south carolina and northern georgia july  food chief eastern south carolina february  etna north carolina and virginia january  handy way north central florida november  express stop southeast north carolina and eastern south carolina october  dash n east central north carolina others less than five stores various north carolina and south carolina total we seek to improve the productivity and profitability of acquired stores by implementing our merchandising and gasoline initiatives  eliminating duplicative costs  reducing overhead and centralizing functions such as purchasing and information technology 
in normal economic and market condition environments  we believe it takes six to twelve months to fully integrate and achieve operational and financial improvements at acquired locations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we can achieve revenue increases or cost savings with respect to any acquisition 
impact of acquisitions 
these acquisitions and the related transactions have had a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations since each of their respective transaction dates 
due to the method of accounting for these acquisitions  the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years presented include results of operations for each of the acquisitions from the date of each acquisition only 
for fiscal acquisitions  the consolidated balance sheets as of september  and the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years september  and september  do not include the assets  liabilities  and results of operations relating to these acquisitions 
as a result  comparisons of fiscal results to prior fiscal years are impacted materially and the underlying performance of same store results is obscured 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue 
total revenue for fiscal was billion compared to billion for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase in total revenue is primarily due to i the revenue from stores acquired in fiscal of million  ii the effect of a full year of revenue from fiscal acquisitions of million and iii a increase in our average retail price of gasoline gallons sold 
these increases were partially offset by comparable store declines in merchandise sales and gasoline gallons of and  respectively  as well as lower commission revenue

the fiscal same store gallon decline was primarily due to lower demand coupled with heightened competitive factors

gasoline gross profit per gallon 
gasoline gross profit per gallon decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to increased volatility in wholesale gasoline markets 
we believe such markets were volatile due to many factors  including world crude supply and demand fundamentals  domestic fuel inventories and domestic refining capacity 
due to this volatility  our margin per gallon sold on a quarterly basis ranged from a low of in our second quarter to a high of in our third quarter of fiscal operating  general and administrative expenses

the restructuring charge consisted of million of employee termination benefits  million of lease obligations and thousand of legal and other professional consultant fees 
during fiscal we also incurred and expended thousand in other non recurring charges for related actions 
the other non recurring charges were one time expenses as a result of this restructuring plan 
income from operations

interest expense see liquidity and capital resources long term debt 
interest expense in fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
in fiscal  interest expense was primarily related to interest costs of million on our senior subordinated notes and approximately million on our senior credit facility 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased borrowings associated with our acquisition activity and a general rise in interest rates

net income 
net income for fiscal was million compared to net income of million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily due to the absence of any extraordinary charges in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which had an extraordinary loss of million associated with certain debt restructuring activity 
adjusting for the number of weeks in fiscal and excluding the fiscal extraordinary loss  the increase in net income in fiscal was 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations 
due to the nature of our business  substantially all sales are for cash 
cash provided by operations is our primary source of liquidity 
we rely primarily upon cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary from time to time by borrowings under our senior credit facility  sale leaseback transactions  asset dispositions and equity investments  to finance our operations  pay interest and fund capital expenditures and acquisitions 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal totaled million  for fiscal totaled million  and for fiscal totaled million 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  senior credit facility 
on january   we entered into our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility consisted of a million revolving credit facility  a million acquisition facility and a million term loan facility 
the revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital financing  general corporate purposes and for the issuance of standby letters of credit 
the acquisition facility is available to fund future acquisitions of related businesses 
as of september   there were million outstanding under the acquisition facility and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  except for approximately million of letters of credit issued thereunder 
as of september   we have approximately million in available borrowing capacity 
during fiscal  we entered into amendments to our senior credit facility to include an additional million under our term loan facility 
proceeds from the term loans were used to prepay amounts outstanding under our acquisition facility and to fund acquisitions closed during fiscal for the twelve month period ending september   we did not satisfy two financial covenants required by our senior credit facility 
we have since received a waiver from our senior credit group and executed an amendment to the senior credit facility that includes  among other things  a modification to financial covenants and increases the floating interest rate spread by basis points as long as its debt ratio is greater than reducing to basis points when the debt ratio is less than the changes to financial covenants  among other things  loosened our coverage and debt ratios and imposed tighter limits on capital expenditures and expenditures to acquire related businesses 
our net capital expenditures are limited to million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in and increases to million thereafter 
the amendment limits acquisition expenditures to million in fiscal and million in fiscal our senior credit facility contains covenants restricting our ability and the ability of any of our subsidiaries to  among other things i incur additional indebtedness  ii declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  iii prepay  redeem or purchase debt  iv incur liens  v make loans and investments  vi make capital expenditures  vii engage in mergers  acquisitions or asset sales  and viii engage in transactions with affiliates 
our senior credit facility also contains financial ratios and tests which must be met with respect to minimum coverage and leverage ratios  pro forma cash flow  maximum business acquisition expenditures and maximum capital expenditures 
restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy 
acquisitions 
in fiscal  we acquired a total of convenience stores in transactions for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
these acquisitions were funded with borrowings under our senior credit facility and cash on hand 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures excluding all acquisitions for fiscal were million 
capital expenditures are primarily expenditures for existing store improvements  store equipment  new store development  information systems and expenditures to comply with regulatory statutes  including those related to environmental matters 
we finance substantially all capital expenditures and new store development through cash flow from operations  a sale leaseback program or similar lease activity  vendor reimbursements and asset dispositions 
our sale leaseback program includes the packaging of our owned convenience store real estate  both land and buildings  for sale to investors in return for their agreement to lease the property back to us under long term leases 
generally  the leases are operating leases at market rates with terms of twenty years with four five year renewal options 
the lease payment is based on market rates applied to the cost of each respective property 
we retain ownership of all personal property and gasoline marketing equipment 
the senior credit facility limits or caps the proceeds of sale leasebacks that we can use to fund our operations or capital expenditures 
under this sale leaseback program  we received million in fiscal and million during fiscal in fiscal  we received approximately million in sale leaseback proceeds  vendor reimbursements for capital improvements and proceeds from asset dispositions  therefore  net capital expenditures  excluding all acquisitions  for fiscal were million 
we anticipate that net capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million 
long term debt 
at september   our long term debt consisted primarily of million of the senior subordinated notes and million in loans under our senior credit facility 
see senior credit facility 
we have outstanding million of senior subordinated notes due interest on the senior subordinated notes is due on october and april of each year 
the senior subordinated notes contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and any restricted subsidiary s ability to i pay dividends or make distributions  except in amounts not in excess of a percentage of our net income or proceeds of debt or equity issuances and in amounts not in excess of million  ii issue stock of subsidiaries  iii make investments in non affiliated entities  except employee loans of up to million  iv repurchase stock  except stock owned by employees in amounts not in excess of million with the proceeds from debt or equity issuances  v incur liens not securing debt permitted under the senior subordinated notes  vi enter into transactions with affiliates  vii enter into sale leaseback transactions or viii engage in mergers or consolidations 
we can incur debt under the senior subordinated notes if the ratio of our pro forma ebitda to fixed charges  after giving effect to such incurrence  is at least to even if we do not meet this ratio we can incur i bank credit facility acquisition debt of up to million and other debt in an amount equal to the greater of million or times our annualized revenues  ii capital leases or acquisition debt in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate of our tangible assets at time of incurrence  iii intercompany debt  iv pre existing debt  v up to million in any type of debt or vi debt for refinancing of the above described debt 
the senior subordinated notes also place conditions on the terms of asset sales or transfers and require us either to reinvest the proceeds of an asset sale or transfer  or  if we do not reinvest those proceeds  to pay down our senior credit facility or other senior debt or to offer to redeem our senior subordinated notes with any asset sale proceeds not so used 
all of the senior subordinated notes may be redeemed after october  at a redemption price which begins at and decreases to after october cash flows from financing activities 
we used proceeds from our senior credit facility and cash on hand to finance fiscal acquisitions and long term debt principal requirements 
cash requirements 
we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flow anticipated to be generated from operations  short term borrowing for seasonal working capital and permitted borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for operating  investing and financing activities  including debt service  for the next twelve months 
shareholders equity 
as of september   our shareholders equity totaled million 
the decrease of million in shareholders equity is attributed to fiscal year net loss of million and a decrease of million in accumulated comprehensive income related to the fair value changes in our qualifying derivative financial instruments 
additional paid in capital is impacted by the accounting treatment applied to a leveraged buyout of the outstanding common stock of our predecessor which resulted in a debit to equity of million 
this debit had the effect  among others  of offsetting million of equity capital invested in us by our shareholders 
environmental considerations 
we are required by federal and state regulations to maintain evidence of financial responsibility for taking corrective action and compensating third parties in the event of a release from our underground storage tank systems 
in order to comply with the applicable requirements  we maintain surety bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately million in favor of state environmental enforcement agencies in the states of north carolina  south carolina  georgia  virginia  tennessee  indiana  kentucky and louisiana 
we also rely on reimbursements from applicable state trust funds 
in florida and georgia we meet such financial responsibility requirements through private commercial liability insurance 
in mississippi  we meet our financial responsibility requirements through coverage under the state trust fund 
all states in which we operate or have operated underground storage tank systems have established trust funds for the sharing  recovering and reimbursing of certain cleanup costs and liabilities incurred as a result of releases from underground storage tank systems 
these trust funds  which essentially provide insurance coverage for the cleanup of environmental damages caused by the operation of underground storage tank systems  are funded by an underground storage tank registration fee and a tax on the wholesale purchase of motor fuels within each state 
we have paid underground storage tank registration fees and gasoline taxes to each state where we operate to participate in these trust programs and we have filed claims and received reimbursement in north carolina  south carolina  kentucky  indiana  georgia  florida and tennessee 
we have also filed claims and received credit toward our trust fund deductibles in virginia 
the coverage afforded by each state fund varies but generally provides up to million per site or occurrence for the cleanup of environmental contamination  and most provide coverage for third party liabilities 
environmental reserves of million as of september   represent estimates for future expenditures for remediation  tank removal and litigation associated with known contaminated sites as a result of releases and are based on current regulations  historical results and certain other factors 
although we can make no assurances  we anticipate that we will be reimbursed for a portion of these expenditures from state trust funds and private insurance 
as of september   amounts which are probable of reimbursement based on our experience from those sources total million and are recorded as long term environmental receivables 
these receivables are expected to be collected within a period of twelve to eighteen months after the reimbursement claim has been submitted 
in florida  remediation of such contamination before january  will be performed by the state and we expect that substantially all of the costs will be paid by the state trust fund 
we do have locations where the applicable trust fund does not cover a deductible or has a co pay which may be less than the cost of such remediation 
to the extent such third parties do not pay for remediation as we anticipate  we will be obligated to make such payments  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
reimbursement from state trust funds will be dependent upon the maintenance and continued solvency of the various funds 
although we are not aware of releases or contamination at other locations where we currently operate or have operated stores  any such releases or contamination could require substantial remediation expenditures  some or all of which may not be eligible for reimbursement from state trust funds 
several of the locations identified as contaminated are being cleaned up by third parties who have indemnified us as to responsibility for clean up matters 
additionally  we are awaiting closure notices on several other locations which will release us from responsibility related to known contamination at those sites 
these sites continue to be included in our environmental reserve until a final closure notice is received 
recently adopted accounting standards effective september   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
as a result of our financing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in seeking to minimize the risk associated with these activities we have entered into interest rate swap arrangements  which effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the adoption of sfas no

subsequently  any impairment losses will be recognized as a component of income from operations 
as of september   we have net goodwill of million and have incurred million in goodwill amortization in the statement of operations during fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
will result in our discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
we will be required to test goodwill using an impairment method under the new standard at adoption and at least annually thereafter  which could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations if an impairment occurs 
as permitted  we early adopted sfas no

inflation during fiscal  wholesale gasoline fuel prices remained volatile  hitting a high of per barrel in october and a low of per barrel in september generally  we pass along wholesale gasoline cost changes to our customers through retail price changes 
gasoline price volatility has had an impact on total revenue  gross profit dollars and gross profit percentage 
general cpi  excluding energy  increased during fiscal and food at home  which is most indicative of our merchandise inventory  increased similarly 
while we have generally been able to pass along these price increases to our customers  we can make no assurances that continued inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our sales and gross profit dollars 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and  in some cases  relate to our acquisitions of related businesses 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing long term debt and any future financing requirements
