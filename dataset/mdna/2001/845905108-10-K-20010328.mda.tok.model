results of operations for the years ended december  and net interest income 
net interest income for was million compared to million for  or an increase of 
the increase in net interest income in was due primarily to the increases in interest earning assets from the sbne acquisition and internal asset growth  offset slightly by the deleveraging of the balance sheet in the second and third quarters of the sbne acquisition added billion to average loans and billion to average deposits replacing higher cost fhlb borrowings in net interest margin operating basis net interest income adjusted to eliminate the negative impact from escrowed financing proceeds related to the sbne acquisition  divided by average interest earning assets was for compared to for interest on interest earning deposits was million for compared to million for the average balance of interest earning deposits was million with an average yield of for compared to an average balance of million with an average yield of for the increase in average interest earning deposits was due to million placed on deposit with fleetboston in march until the acquisition was completed in july the high yields were the result of an outsourced accounts payable process whereby a third party vendor performs check processing and reconcilement functions for sovereign s disbursement accounts and pays sovereign interest on disbursed funds during the two to three day float period  effectively producing interest income with no corresponding asset balance 
the decrease in rates was due primarily to the lower relative interest rate earned on the million deposit mentioned above as compared to the implied rate earned on the accounts payable process 
interest on investment securities available for sale was million for compared to million for the decrease in interest income was due to the decrease in average investment securities available for sale from billion in to billion in  which resulted from the sale of approximately billion in investment securities in june and september 
interest on investment securities held to maturity was million for compared to million for the average balance of investment securities held to maturity was billion with an average yield of for compared to an average balance of billion with an average yield of for the increase in the average balance was primarily due to the creation of a billion escrow fund in the fourth quarter  which was used to fund the sbne transaction 
the escrow funds were invested in commercial paper which matured in conjunction with the escrow break on the final closing of the acquisition on july  interest and fees on loans were billion for compared to million for the average balance of net loans was billion with an average yield of for compared to an average balance of billion with an average yield of for the increase in average loan volume was primarily the result of the sbne acquisition and internal loan growth 
the acquisition added billion to average loans

interest on total deposits was million for compared to million for the average balance of total deposits was billion with an average cost of for compared to an average balance of billion with an average cost of for the increase in the average balance was due primarily to the acquisition of deposits in the sbne acquisition  which added over billion to average deposits during the increase in rates in mainly reflects the increase in time deposit and money market account rates due to market conditions

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan loss is based upon credit loss experience and an estimation of losses arising in the current loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million for the higher provisioning was required because of an increase in net charge offs during the year  and management s desire to raise the overall level of the allowance  from 
at to in  given increased levels of non performing and potential problem loans  and current economic conditions 
as sovereign continues to place emphasis on commercial and consumer lending  management will regularly evaluate the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and increase its loan loss provision as is necessary 
historically  sovereign s additions to its loan loss allowance through income statement charges and acquisition accounting have been sufficient to absorb the incremental credit risk in its loan portfolio 
during  sovereign established an initial allowance of million in connection with the sbne acquisition 
this initial allowance for sbne  together with the provision of million exceeded net charge offs  and thereby increased the loan loss allowance by million over levels 
sovereign s net charge offs for were million and consisted of charge offs of million and recoveries of million 
this compares to net charge offs of million consisting of charge offs of million and recoveries of million 
sovereign s increased level of commercial charge offs in was related primarily to deterioration in a segment of the portfolio concentrated in cash flow  or enterprise lending in syndicated multi bank credits that were originated by other banks and participated in by sovereign  as well as direct loans made to sovereign customers 
the ratio of net loan charge offs to average loans  including loans held for sale  was

for  amount includes million of loan loss allowance established as part of the fleet auto acquisition  partially off set by net charge offs of million related to first state for the three month period ended december  resulting from the differing fiscal year end of first state 
sovereign s policy for charging off loans varies with respect to the category of loans and specific circumstances surrounding each loan under consideration 
consumer loans and residential real estate mortgage loans are generally charged off when deemed to be uncollectible or days past due  whichever comes first 
charge offs of commercial loans are made on the basis of management s ongoing evaluation of non performing loans 
other income 
total other income was million for compared to million for several factors contributed to the decrease in other income as discussed below 
deposit fees were million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to a favorable shift into core and corporate deposit products over the last year and the impact of the sbne acquisition 
mortgage banking revenues were million for compared to million for at december   sovereign serviced billion of residential loans for others as compared to billion at december  sovereign sold mortgage servicing rights related to billion of loans during loan fees and service charges were million for compared to million for this increase was due primarily to the sbne acquisition which added billion in loans 
net losses on sales of loans and investment securities were million for  compared to a net gain of million for  which included net investment security gains losses of million and million  and net gains losses on sales of loans of 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
this decrease was due primarily to the balance sheet deleveraging transactions 
during the second and third quarters of  sovereign sold billion of available for sale mortgage backed securities  resulting in losses of million 
the net impact of the sales on equity was minimal as these losses were previously reflected as unrealized losses included as a reduction of stockholders equity in accordance with sfas during  sovereign created a capital markets group 
the group was built in three phases 
the first phase provided risk management services for corporate clients including foreign exchange  investments and derivatives 
the first phase also included securitization expertise for sovereign s balance sheet assets 
the second phase added merger andacquisitions expertise to assist clients 
the third phase  in process at december   includes the formation of a broker dealer 
the capital markets group generated revenue of million in income from bank owned life insurance boli was million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to an additional investment in boli of million which was made during the year 
general and administrative expenses 
total general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million in included in total general and administrative expenses were million of merger related  integration and other charges related to recent acquisitions 
these special charges include charges directly attributable to the acquired sbnebranches  indirect costs incurred to integrate recent acquisitions into sovereign s back office systems  costs that management considered redundant due to separating the sbne acquisition from a single closing into three separate closings  and expenses related to the structured real estate transaction that involved properties utilized by sbne 
included in general and administrative expenses were million of merger and integration charges 
excluding the special charges  general and administrative expenses were million and million  for and respectively  or an increase of 
this increase was due primarily to the sbne acquisition which increased compensation and benefits expense for the approximately  staff and management personnel which were added  increased occupancy and equipment expenses for the additional community banking offices acquired  and increased other administrative expenses resulting from the acquisition 
these expenses were reflected in results from each of the respective three closing dates 
see note business combinations for more details on the sbne acquisition 
sovereign s efficiency ratio all operating general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net interest income and recurring non interest income for was compared to for other operating expenses 
total other operating expenses were million for compared to million for other operating expenses included amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of million for compared to million for and trust preferred securities expense of million for compared to million for the increase in amortization expense is due to the sbne acquisition which added billion to sovereign s intangible assets 
trust preferred securities expense increased due to the issuance of additional securities in november income tax provision 
the income tax benefit was million for compared to a provision of million for the effective tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate for year is not meaningful due to the high proportion of permanent tax differences  including certain one time tax benefits included in operating earnings  in relation to the recorded pretax loss 
for additional information with respect to sovereign s income taxes  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements hereof 
extraordinary item 
during the first quarter of  sovereign sold fhlb advances which resulted in a pretax gain of million million after tax and is treated as an early extinguishment of debt under generally accepted accounting principles 
financial condition loan portfolio 
sovereign s loan portfolio at december  was billion compared to billion at december  the increase in net loans was due to the sbne acquisition which added billion in loans and strong originations in sovereign s existing franchise offset by the securitization of commercial and consumer loans and the conversion of residential loans to mortgage backed securities 
as a result of the sbne acquisition and a continued focus on non residential lending in its existing franchise portfolio  sovereign s loan portfolio included billion of commercial loans and billion of consumer loans 
this compares to billion of commercial loans and billion of consumer loans  at december  in addition to the billion of commercial loans acquired in the sbne acquisition  there were billion of commercial loans originated during  compared to billion of commercial loans originated during this decrease was due to a high level of originations in in the specialty lending group including the syndicated cash flow loan participations and other portfolios 
cash flow lending was curtailed in due to credit risk considerations 
in addition to the billion of consumer loans acquired in the sbne acquisition  sovereign originated billion of consumer loans during compared to billion of consumer loans for at december   sovereign s total loan portfolio included billion of first mortgage loans secured primarily by liens on owner occupied one to four family residential properties compared to billion at december  total production of first mortgage loans was billion in of which 
billion were sold in the secondary market 
this compares to first mortgage loan closings of billion and billion of loans sold for in addition  sovereign acquired and retained billion of residential mortgages from fleetboston  excluding billion of residential mortgages which were not relationship assets and were subsequently sold as part of sovereign s asset liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk 
during  sovereign securitized commercial automotive floor plan loans of million and consumer home equity loans of million 
see note asset securitizations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
sovereign also converted billion of residential mortgages to fhlmc mortgage backed securities which are included in sovereign s investment securities held to maturity portfolio at december  federal law limits the amount of non residential mortgage loans a savings institution  such as sovereign bank  may make 
the law limits a savings institution to a maximum of of its assets in large commercial loans  with another of assets permissible in small business loans

extending credit exposes sovereign to credit risk  which is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan 
sovereign manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards  guidelines and limitations established by the board of directors 
written loan policies establish underwriting standards  lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured  have also been established 
loan approval authority ranges from the individual loan officer to the board of directors loan committee 
in addition to being subjected to the judgement of experienced loan officers and their managers  loans over a certain dollar size also require the co approval of credit officers independent of the loan officer to ensure consistency and quality in accordance with sovereign s credit standards 
the loan review group conducts ongoing  independent reviews of the lending process to ensure adherence to established policies and procedures  monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations  provides objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and ensures that proper documentation exists 
the results of these periodic reviews are reported to the asset review committee  and to the board of directors of both sovereign and sovereign bank 
in response to sovereign s increased emphasis on commercial and consumer lending  sovereign has added to its loan review group by hiring loan review officers with significant commercial and consumer experience 
sovereign also maintains a watch list for certain loans identified as requiring a higher level of monitoring by management because of one or more factors  such as economic conditions  industry trends  nature of collateral  collateral margin  payment history  or other factors 
commercial loan credit quality is strong but due to questions on the strength of the economy  is under a high level of scrutiny by both line management and the independent loan review group 
the following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses sovereign s strategies for managing the related credit risk 
commercial loans 
credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing and expected economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk sovereign is willing to assume 
to manage credit risk when extending commercial credit  sovereign focuses on both assessing the borrower s capacity and willingness to repay and on obtaining sufficient collateral 
commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets and by personal guarantees 
commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the pennsylvania  new jersey  and new england market areas and are secured by developed real estate at conservative loan to values and often by a guarantee of the borrower 
management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry do not exist 
consumer loans 
credit risk in the direct consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider debt to income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and  if secured  collateral values 
in the home equity loan portfolio  combined loan to value ratios are generally limited to or credit insurance is purchased to limit exposure 
other credit considerations may warrant higher combined loan to value ratios for approved loans 
the portion of the consumer portfolio which is secured by real estate  vehicles  deposit accounts or government guarantees comprises of the entire portfolio 
residential loans 
sovereign originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans which are secured by the underlying family residential property 
at december  and  residential loans accounted for and  respectively  of the total loan portfolio 
this decrease was the outcome of sovereign s increased emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower  including debt to equity ratios  credit scores  and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance  unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the federal  state or local government 
sovereign also utilizes underwriting standards which comply with those of the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or the federal national mortgage association fnma 
credit risk is further reduced since a portion of sovereign s fixed rate mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse 
collections 
sovereign closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality 
collection efforts begin within days after a loan payment is missed by attempting to contact all borrowers and to offer a variety of loss mitigation alternatives 
if these attempts fail  sovereign will proceed to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses 
while liquidation and recovery efforts continue  officers continue to work with the borrowers  if appropriate  to recover all monies owed to sovereign 
sovereign monitors delinquency trends at   and days past due 
these trends are discussed at the monthly asset review committee meetings 
minutes from these meetings are submitted to the board of directors of sovereign bank 
non performing assets 
at december   sovereign s non performing assets were million compared to million at december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was 
at december  compared to 
at december  this increase was caused by each segment of the portfolio  but notably in residential and commercial portfolios 
commercial non performing loans are higher due to deterioration in a segment of the portfolio concentrated in cash flow  or enterprise lending in syndicated  multi bank credits that were originated by other banks and participated in by sovereign  as well as direct loans made to sovereign customers 
at december   of non performing assets consisted of loans related to real estate or oreo 
another of non performing assets consist of indirect auto loans and other repossessed assets 
indirect auto loans delinquent in excess of days carry an allowance allocation of 
repossessed autos carry an allowance allocation of 
sovereign places all loans days or more delinquent except auto loans and loans guaranteed by the government or secured by deposit accounts on non performing status 
sovereign s auto loans continue to accrue interest until they are days delinquent  at which time they are placed on non accrual status and a allowance allocation is assigned 
effective january   sovereign will extend the auto loans accrual policy to other consumer loans

interest income recorded on these loans for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans consisting of loans for which management has doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present repayment terms  although not currently classified as non performing loans amounted to approximately million and million at december  and allowance for loan loss 
the adequacy of sovereign s allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb potential loan losses takes into consideration the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  past loan loss experience  specific loans which have loss potential  geographic and industry concentrations  delinquency trends  economic conditions  the level of originations and other relevant factors 
management also considers loan quality  changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  amount of non performing loans  delinquency trends  economic conditions  industry trends and consultation with regulatory authorities when determining the allowance 
the company s last regulatory examination was as of september  at december   sovereign s loan delinquencies all performing loans greater than days delinquent as a percentage of total loans was compared to at december  this increase was evident in each segment of the portfolio 
overall  management believes that delinquencies  charge offs  and non performing statistics have evidenced deterioration because of certain specific factors and not weakness throughout the entire portfolio 
nonetheless  the allowance has been increased from 
to of total loans reflecting these trends and the shift in portfolio composition throughout the year  and credit risk management processes continue to identify deterioration as soon as possible 
at december   sovereign s loan portfolio was residential  consumer and commercial 
at december   sovereign s loan portfolio was residential  consumer and commercial 
along with higher yields  management believes this shift in loan composition brings higher inherent risk 
sovereign maintains an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
as discussed in credit management  sovereign believes the current allowance to be at a level adequate to cover such inherent losses 
at december   the company s total allowance was million 
the company s total allowance at year end equated to approximately times the average charge offs for the last three years and times the average net charge offs for the same three year period 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  the company also gives consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
sovereign applies similar methods of determining the loan loss allowance for purchased loan portfolios as it does in establishing allowances for originated loans 
sovereign established million of allowance for loan losses for the loans acquired in the sbne acquisition 
in establishing this allowance  sovereign utilized its methodology  adjusted for increased uncertainty regarding the quality of the acquired loans 
sovereign performed specific reviews of large non homogeneous loans  and established specific allowances accordingly 
for homogenous loans  sovereign established the loan loss allowance based on limited available performance history  industry statistics and similar experiences with other acquired portfolios 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements i an allocated allowance  which for non homogeneous loans is comprised of allowances established on specific classified loans  and class allowances for both homogeneous and non homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and current trends  and ii unallocated allowances based on both general economic conditions and other risk factors in the company s individual markets and portfolios  and to account for a level of imprecision in management s estimation process 
the allowance recorded for consumer and residential portfolios is based on an analysis of product mix  credit scoring and risk composition of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences  economic conditions and historical and expected delinquency and charge off statistics for each homogeneous category or group of loans 
based on this information and analysis  an allowance is established approximating a rolling twelve month estimate of net charge offs 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on an analysis of the individual credits and relationships and is separated into two parts  the specific allowance and the class allowance 
the specific allowance element of the commercial loan allowance is based on a regular analysis of criticized commercial loans where internal credit ratings are below a predetermined classification 
this analysis is performed by the managed asset division  where loans with recognized deficiencies are administered  and periodically reviewed by the loan review department 
the specific allowance established for these criticized loans is based on a careful analysis of related collateral value  cash flow considerations and  if applicable  guarantor capacity 
the class allowance element of the commercial loan allowance is determined by an internal loan grading process in conjunction with associated allowance factors 
these class allowance factors are updated annually and are based primarily on actual historical loss experience  consultation with regulatory authorities  and peer groups loss experience 
while this analysis is conducted annually  the company has the ability to revise the class allowance factors whenever necessary in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given loan pool classification 
regardless of the extent of the company analysis of customer performance  portfolio evaluations  trends or risk management processes established  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends  volatility of economic or customer conditions and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allocated allowances for homogeneous groups of loans among other factors 
the company maintains an unallocated allowance to recognize the existence of these exposures 
these other risk factors are continuously reviewed and revised by management where conditions indicate that the estimates initially applied are different from actual results 
a comprehensive analysis of the allowance for loan losses is performed by the company on a quarterly basis 
in addition  a review of allowance levels based on nationally published statistics is conducted on an annual basis 
the company has an asset review committee  which has the responsibility of affirming allowance methodology and assessing the general and specific allowance factors in relation to estimated and actual net charge off trends 
this committee is also responsible for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for each loan pool classification at sovereign 
although the company determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately and this process is an important credit management tool  the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio 
the actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company s methodology includes several factors intended to minimize the differences between estimated and actual losses 
these factors allow the company to adjust its estimate of losses based on the most recent information available 
during  management analysis of historical losses of the residential and consumer portfolios enabled the company to reduce reserves for these portfolios to a level that is more comparable to the portfolio s performance history  as discussed below

the allowance for the residential mortgage portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase was due primarily to reserves established in connection with the sbne acquisition of million offset somewhat by a reduction of million of reserves allocated to the originated portion of the portfolio due to a change in estimate 
the increase between years represents an increase in absolute levels  from 
at december   to 
at december   reflecting some increased levels of delinquencies and non performing assets 
delinquencies  stated on a consistent basis to reflect the ffiec classification guidelines implemented in  increased slightly from at december  to at december  consumer portfolio 
the allowance for the consumer loan portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december  due to reserves established in connection with the sbne acquisition of million offset by a change in estimate of million related to management s analysis of portfolio performance over the past several years 
specifically  since its acquisition of the portfolio from fleetboston financial in  the company enhanced its underwriting and credit monitoring processes related to its indirect auto portfolio and purchased indirect auto portfolio  which has resulted in a decrease in historical net charge offs in the auto portfolio from for to 
for commercial portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses for the commercial portfolio increased million to million at december  this increase is due to reserves established in connection with the sbne acquisition of million and management s evaluation of general economic conditions and trends in the performance of this portfolio which resulted in an increased allocation of million due to deterioration of certain asset based and cash flow loans in the specialty lending group 
the allowance allocated to the commercial portfolio was increased by million due to rating changes in the company s general commercial credits 
although sovereign experienced deterioration in credit quality in selected portfolios  seasoning and improved performance enabled the company to release million and million  respectively  from its small business portfolio and commercial real estate portfolio 
total commercial non accrual loans as a percentage of total commercial loans increased from 
at december  to 
at december  primarily in the aforementioned specialty lending group  and resulted in the allowance allocated to commercial loans as a percentage of total commercial loans increasing from at december  to at december  in addition to the increase in non accruals noted above  this increase was due to management s belief that economic conditions are showing signs of slowing from periods of earlier robust growth and markets are mixed 
unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance increased million to million at december  the increase in the unallocated allowance is related to management s evaluation of current economic conditions  loan portfolio trends  and recently acquired portfolios 
the increase raises the unallocated allowance as a percentage of the total allowance for loan losses from at december  to at december  this is a result of increased uncertainty with respect to current economic conditions  along with the shift in the company s loan composition  which brings higher inherent risk 
investment securities 
sovereign s investment portfolio is concentrated in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by federal agencies or private label issues 
the private label issues have ratings of aaa by standard and poor s and fitch at the date of issuance 
the classes are backed by single family residential loans which are primary residences geographically dispersed throughout the united states 
sovereign purchases classes which are senior positions backed by subordinate classes 
the subordinate classes absorb the losses and must be completely eliminated before any losses flow through the senior positions 
sovereign s strategy is to purchase classes which have an average life of four years or less 
the effective duration of the total investment portfolio at december  was years

bank regulatory capital federal law requires institutions regulated by the office of thrift supervision to have a minimum leverage capital ratio equal to of tangible assets and of risk adjusted assets  and a risk based capital ratio equal to 
federal law also requires ots regulated institutions to have a minimum tangible capital equal to of total tangible assets 
the ots order  as amended  applicable to the approval of the sbne acquisition the ots order requires sovereign bank to be well capitalized and also to meet certain additional requirements and other conditions 
various agreements with our lenders also require sovereign bank to be well capitalized at all times and in compliance with all regulatory requirements 
to be well capitalized  a thrift institution must maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of and total risk based capital of 
management believes  as of december  and  that sovereign bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject in order to be well capitalized 
management expects that sovereign bank will continue to be classified as well capitalized and in compliance with such capital requirements and conditions 
although ots capital regulations do not apply to savings and loan holding companies  the ots order requires us to maintain certain tier capital levels 
we are presently in compliance with this requirement and expect to remain as such

other sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased  asset securitizations  liquid investment portfolio securities and debt issuances 
sovereign is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in cash and other qualifying investments 
current regulations require sovereign bank to maintain liquid assets of not less than of its net withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings

factors which impact the liquidity position of sovereign include loan origination volumes  loan prepayment rates  maturity structure of existing loans  core deposit growth levels  cd maturity structure and retention  sovereign s credit ratings  investment portfolio cash flows  maturity structure of wholesale funding  etc 
these risks are monitored and centrally managed 
this process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources 
as of december   sovereign had billion in available overnight liquidity in the form of unused federal funds purchased lines  unused fhlb borrowing capacity and unencumbered investment portfolio securities 
sovereign also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure that adequate liquidity is available at all times 
during  the company completed the following transactions to provide either additional capital and or increased liquidity securitizations in december  the company securitized and sold approximately million of home equity loans 
in october  sovereign securitized and sold million of automotive floor plan commercial loans 
branch sale in the fourth quarter  sovereign sold certain non strategic branches with deposits of million 
the securitizations and branch sales resulted in a net gain of million  recorded as other income in the financial statements 
reit preferred stock in august  the company raised million from issuance of preferred stock of a subsidiary  sovereign reit 
structured real estate transaction in the second quarter   sovereign executed a structured real estate transaction that involved the sale and subsequent leaseback of its own real estate and entered into a long term lease arrangement for certain real estate used in the sbne franchise 
the total transaction was valued at million 
total expenses related to the transaction were approximately million pretax and were recorded as merger related charges 
during  the company raised billion of debt and equity to finance its acquisition of sovereign bank new england 
components of these financings were as follows common stock million shares of common stock were issued on november  resulting in net proceeds to sovereign of million 
piers units million units of trust preferred income equity redeemable securities piers were issued on november   resulting in net proceeds to sovereign of million  million of which has been allocated to the value of the warrants and is treated as original issue discount 
the original issue discount is accreted into trust preferred securities expense over the life of the unit resulting in an effective yield of 
each piers unit consists of a preferred security issued by sovereign capital trust ii the trust  having a stated liquidation amount of  representing an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the trust  which assets consist solely of debentures issued by sovereign

the senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of sovereign and rank equally with all existing and future senior indebtedness 
senior secured credit facility million floating rate senior secured credit facility resulting in net proceeds to sovereign of million on december  the senior secured credit facility is secured primarily by the stock of sovereign bank  which is wholly owned by sovereign bancorp 
the senior facility will mature on the date six months prior to the maturity date of the senior notes  but in no event later than june  the facility s original amortization schedule was as follows  million   million   million  and  million with mandatory prepayments occurring if sovereign s cash flow exceeds predetermined levels 
during year  sovereign made its required million payment on the senior credit facility  and made additional payments of million 
these prepayments were made voluntarily  and not due to sovereign s cash flow exceeding the predefined levels proscribed 
on march   sovereign repaid this senior credit facility with the proceeds from another debt issuance as described below 
activities subsequent to december   sovereign entered into the following transactions common stock on february   sovereign issued million of common equity consisting of million shares sold at per common stock share 
the proceeds of the issuance were used to repay a portion of the million of senior notes which matured on march  senior notes on february   sovereign issued million of senior unsecured notes at which will mature on march  the proceeds of this issuance were used to repay the remaining portion of the million of senior notes which matured on march  and for additional liquidity 
senior secured credit facility on march   sovereign refinanced the million senior secured credit facility described above outstanding balance at december  of million with a variable principal rate million senior secured credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit and a million term note 
for the first two years  the interest rates on both the line of credit and term loan is calculated using one of five methods at the option of sovereign as month eurodollar rate plus bp  month eurodollar rate plus bp  month eurodollar rate plus bp  month eurodollar rate plus bp  the greater of the prime rate  plus bp  or fed funds rate plus bp 
the interest rates for years are structured based upon a rate table beginning with the eurodollar rate plus bp or the greater of the prime rate plus bp or the federal funds rate plus bp  and are decreased based upon each level of sovereign s senior unsecured long term debt credit rating exceeding certain levels 
the revolving line matures million in  million in  and million in  and the term note matures in cash and cash equivalents increased million for net cash used by operating activities was million for net cash provided by investing activities for was billion primarily due to the maturity of billion securities held in escrow to finance the sbne acquisition  and the sale of billion of investment securities as a part of the strategy to deleverage the balance sheet  and the cash received from the sbne acquisition 
net cash used by financing activities for was billion which was primarily attributable to repayment of short term borrowings 
sovereign s debt agreements impose customary limitations on dividends  other payments and transactions 
these limits are not expected to affect dividend payments at current levels  and reasonably anticipated increases 
asset and liability management interest rate risk arises primarily through sovereign s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences  affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
in managing its interest rate risk  the bank seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing its net interest income and net interest margin 
to achieve these objectives  the bank works closely with each business line in the company and guides new business flows 
the bank also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting  investment portfolio purchase strategies  asset securitization sale  and financial derivatives 
interest rate risk is managed centrally by the asset and liability committee 
management reviews various forms of analysis to monitor interest rate risk including net interest income sensitivity  market value sensitivity  repricing frequency of assets versus liabilities and scenario analysis 
numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses including assumptions on new business volumes  loan and investment prepayment rates  deposit flows  interest rate curves  economic conditions  competitor pricing  etc 
sovereign reviews nine instantaneous rate shock scenarios to assess the sensitivity of net interest income due to changes in interest rates including parallel shocks  curve steepening scenarios and curve flattening scenarios 
at december   if interest rates moved in parallel basis points up or down  or if the yield curve steepened or flattened by basis points  sovereign estimates the loss to net interest income to remain under 
this has improved significantly from december  when the sensitivity in the worst scenario exceeded 
this improvement is due to the following factors addition of billion of deposits from the sbne acquisition  wholesale funding paydown of over billion  investment deleveraging of over billion  increase in the core deposit mix and the increase in the mix of shorter duration consumer and commercial loans 
net interest income sensitivity is used to gauge the short term interest rate risk of the bank 
sovereign also monitors the relative repricing sensitivities of its assets versus its liabilities 
as of december   the one year cumulative gap was versus one year earlier 
this improvement is due to the same factors listed above 
a neutral gap position indicates that the bank s margin will be stable across various interest rate scenarios 
finally  sovereign monitors the market value sensitivity of its assets versus the market value sensitivity of its liabilities 
the analysis calculates the market value of assets  subtracts the market value of liabilities and adds any off balance sheet items to come up with its net portfolio value npv 
this npv is then calculated in numerous interest rate scenarios 
imbalances in this analysis indicate that the bank has sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
at december   sovereign has a very balanced profile  in correlation to the gap analysis and net interest income simulation results discussed above 
when measuring net portfolio value npv  sovereign monitors closely two specific interest rate environments as measured by standard industry practice  an instantaneous rate shock of up and down basis points 
if rates move up or down in parallel by basis points  sovereign s npv remains remarkably constant with a loss of less than in the worst scenario of rates falling basis points 
the worst case scenario is used as a benchmark by regulators and sovereign to measure and monitor the interest rate risk sensitivity of an institution 
npv is used as a gauge of long term interest rate risk 
because the assumptions used are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume and characteristics of new business and behavior of existing positions  and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
pursuant to its interest rate risk management strategy  sovereign enters into off balance sheet transactions which involve interest rate exchange agreements swaps  caps  and floors for interest rate risk management purposes 
sovereign s objective in managing its interest rate risk is to provide sustainable levels of net interest income while limiting the impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate swaps are generally used to convert fixed rate assets and liabilities to variable rate assets and liabilities and vice versa 
sovereign utilizes interest rate swaps that have a high degree of correlation to the related financial instrument 
at december   sovereign s principal off balance sheet transactions were to convert liabilities from fixed rate to floating rate to reduce the cost of funds 
interest rate caps are generally used to limit the exposure from the repricing and maturity of liabilities and interest rate floors are generally used to limit the exposure from the repricing and maturity of assets 
interest rate caps and floors are also used to limit the exposure created by other interest rate swaps 
in certain cases  interest rate caps and floors are simultaneously bought and sold to create a range of protection against changing interest rates while limiting the cost of that protection 
as part of its mortgage banking strategy  sovereign originates fixed rate residential mortgages 
it sells the majority of these loans to fhlmc  fnma  and private investors 
the loans are exchanged for cash or marketable fixed rate mortgage backed securities which are generally sold 
this helps insulate sovereign from the interest rate risk associated with these fixed rate assets 
sovereign uses forward sales  cash sales and options on mortgage backed securities as a means of hedging loans in the mortgage pipeline which are originated for sale 
to accommodate customer needs  sovereign enters into customer related financial derivative transactions primarily consisting of interest rate swaps  caps  and floors 
risk exposure from customer positions is managed through transactions with other dealers
