the company has experienced and is expected to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results  both between different quarters within the same fiscal year and with respect to the same quarter between different fiscal years

the company had a working capital deficit of approximately million at september  and million at september  and a working capital surplus of million at september  the company has historically maintained working capital deficits since the bulk of its revenue generating assets are classified as long term assets rather than current assets 
the working capital surplus in was primarily the result of the refinancing of the company s senior bank debt which resulted in more of the company s debt being classified as long term 
the company did not pay dividends in fiscal  and and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
management believes that cash flow generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the new credit facility will be sufficient to meet the anticipated operating cash needs and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
because the company s future operating results will depend on a number of factors  including the demand for the company s products and services  the company s ability to market  sell and support products  competition  the success of the company s research and development programs  the ability to achieve competitive and technological advances  general and economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control  there can be no assurance that sufficient capital resources will be available to fund the expected expansion of its business beyond such period
