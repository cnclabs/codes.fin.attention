item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements  which reflect the current view of the partnership with respect to future events and financial performance 
the words expect  intend  believe  anticipate  likely and will and similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause the partnership s actual results to differ from current expectations include  among others  changes in the aircraft or aircraft leasing market  economic downturn in the airline industry  default by lessees under leases causing the partnership to incur uncontemplated expenses or not to receive rental income as and when expected  the partnership s inability to re lease or sell  at favorable terms  any aircraft returned at lease expiration or any delays in re leasing or selling such aircraft  changes in interest rates  consolidation in the airline industry and legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the value of aircraft 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership presently has three long term debt facilities 
at december   the following amounts were outstanding million on a non recourse note collateralized by one aircraft leased to fedex  million on a non recourse note collateralized by one aircraft on lease to trans world airlines  and million on a long term variable rate revolving loan facility guaranteed by the partnership and collateralized by two aircraft on lease to us airways 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was outstanding under the partnership s loan facilities 
at december  approximately million remained available under the revolving loan facility 
long term borrowings at december  represented of the original cost of the aircraft presently owned by the partnership  including capital expenditures for upgrades 
the terms of the partnership agreement permit debt to be at a level not exceeding of such cost 
total scheduled debt service principal and interest on the fixed loans in is million  and the principal payment on the floating loan in is projected to be million if no purchase or sale of aircraft or any unforeseen business events occur 
debt service will be paid primarily from the rental payments received under aircraft leases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for  and million for aside from the cash flow activity associated with taxes payable  the net cash flow provided by operating activities showed moderate decreases over the three year period 
the decrease was due to reduced rentals as a result of a smaller portfolio 
total debt service on the fixed loans as a percentage of net cash provided by operating activities was   and for  and  respectively 
however  cash flow from operating activities does not fully reflect cash receipts from lease payments 
when the excess of rental receipts above finance lease income is added to cash flow from operating activities  the ratios become   and  respectively 
the lower ratio as compared with reflects a greater rate of debt repayment in  while the cash received from lease rentals remained about the same for each of and the ratio is comparable to the ratio of as the debt service and the cash flow from operating activities for both years were also comparable 
cash distributions paid by the partnership were million per unit in  million per unit in  and million per unit in there were no special cash distributions paid in  or partnership net income was million in  million in  and million in the decline in net income from to and from to is primarily due to a smaller asset base  as the balances due from the lessees declined 
pursuant to the limited partnership agreement  the partnership distributed all cash available from operations net of expenses and reserves  as described above 
since such distributions were in excess of earnings  partnership equity declined from million at december  to million at december   and limited partner equity per unit declined from to 
from a limited partner perspective  the portion of the distribution in excess of net income constitutes a return of capital 
total cash distributions declared since inception of the partnership have exceeded total net income by per unit 
results of operations vs 
the revenue reduction in as compared with is primarily due to the scheduled decline in finance lease income as the balances due from the lessees declined 
us airways  the partnership s major lessee of total year end assets reported a net loss of million on revenues of billion for  compared with profits of million on revenues of billion for fedex of total year end assets reported profits of million on revenues of billion for fiscal year ended may   compared with profits of million on revenues of billion for twa of total year end assets reported a net loss of million on revenues of billion for the first nine months of  compared with a net loss of million on revenues of billion for the comparable period 
twa filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on january  and failed to make its lease payments under its lease with the partnership on december   january  and february  as a result of the lease payment defaults  the partnership has been making debt service payments under its long term debt secured by the twa aircraft from other sources of cash 
on march   twa made its lease payments that were due on december  and january  twa is expected to file with the us bankruptcy court a stipulation  agreement and order pursuant to which twa agrees to cure the february  lease payment default within certain time limits 
on march   the us bankruptcy court approved the sale of most assets of twa to american airlines parent corporation 
consummation of the sale is subject to federal antitrust regulatory approval and other closing conditions 
american airlines has entered into an agreement with the partnership  which becomes effective only upon consummation of the sale to american airlines of the twa assets  pursuant to which american airlines would assume the twa lease subject to a reduced lease rate and an extended lease term 
the reduction in cash receipts and the bankruptcy of twa have led to a reduction in cash distributions to unitholders  beginning with the cash distribution for the first quarter of for information regarding the percentage of total partnership assets and revenues represented by aircraft owned and leased by the partnership  see business aircraft portfolio 
the partnership believes that its revenues and income have not been materially affected by inflation and changing prices because its principal items of revenue rental payments and a majority of its expenses interest are at fixed long term rates 
expenses in were million or  lower than the expenses of million 
the decline in expenses is primarily due to lower interest expense in as a result of the partnership s reduced debt balances 
debt balances declined from million at december  to million at december  vs 
the revenue reduction in as compared with is primarily due to the scheduled decline in finance lease income as the balances due from the lessees declined 
at year end  all of the partnership s lessees were current under their lease agreements and none was in bankruptcy 
outlook in september   the leases with us airways for five of the seven aircraft in the partnership s aircraft portfolio expire 
under the leases  us airways is required  by april  to decide whether to renew the leases or to return the aircraft 
if us airways elects to renew the leases  the leases will continue but perhaps at a lower lease rate 
alternatively  if us airways decides to return the aircraft  the general partner will market the aircraft to others for either sale or a new lease 
if the five aircraft on lease to us airways  which represent approximately of the partnership s portfolio  are sold  the general partner would likely seek also to sell the remaining two aircraft in the partnership s portfolio 
the partnership intends to distribute the net proceeds from the sale of any aircraft to unitholders 
as the time of lease expirations nears  distributions to unitholders will depend more on the residual value of the aircraft in the partnership s portfolio than on the rental payment obligation from existing lessees the booked residual value per unit is 
although the partnership has consistently sold aircraft at prices in excess of book value  aircraft values depend on the supply and demand for aircraft  economic conditions  and other factors 
consequently  the general partner cannot precisely determine the net proceeds available from the sale of aircraft or whether such proceeds will be above or below book value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the partnership s assets consist of aircraft subject to leases  accounted for as finance leases  and thus consist of a future stream of fixed rental payments and a residual interest in the aircraft 
see note to financial statements for information as to finance lease receivables 
at december   the partnership had long term fixed rate notes payable of  and a revolving variable rate loan facility with  outstanding and approximately  of credit available 
see note to financial statements for information as to minimum future principal payments due and the interest rates applicable to the notes and revolving credit facility 
since the rental payments under its leases are fixed  but a portion of its liabilities are based on a variable interest rate  the assets and liabilities of the partnership are not perfectly hedged and the partnership bears some risk of interest rate fluctuations 
since a portion of its debt under the revolving credit facility is for variable working capital needs  the general partner believes that the risk of interest fluctuations is appropriate under the circumstances
