item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general our revenues are derived from product license fees and charges for services  including technical consulting  training  and customer support 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our software license revenues are generally recognized when a customer purchase order has been received and accepted  the software product has been shipped  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
for customer license agreements that meet these recognition criteria  the portion of the fees related to software licenses will generally be recognized in the current period  while the portion of the fees related to services is recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from consulting and training are recognized when earned 
our license agreements do not provide a right of return  and reserves are maintained for potential credit losses  of which there have been only immaterial amounts 
international sales accounted for   and of our revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
in the fiscal year ended march   our revenues from product sales grew  while revenues from consulting and support grew  resulting in a net overall increase in revenues of 
there can be no assurance that this revenue mix or growth in revenues trend will continue in future periods 
although we have experienced increasing revenues in each of the past five fiscal years  our sales compensation structure has historically contributed to revenues for the first quarter of a fiscal year being lower than revenues for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience sequentially increasing revenues or that such seasonal fluctuations will not become more pronounced in the future 
acquisitions we completed a business combination with objectime limited in january  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
additionally  we completed business combinations with catapulse inc and attol testware in  which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of these combinations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain line items from our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  net product revenues consulting and support revenues total revenues cost of product revenues cost of consulting and support revenues total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization of deferred stock based compensation charges for acquired in process research and development total operating expenses income from continuing operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes minority interest net income fiscal years ended march  and revenues total revenues increased in fiscal compared with fiscal net product revenues 
net product revenues increased million or  in fiscal compared with fiscal this increase was a result of continued strong customer acceptance of our existing products  including the rational suite family of products  products for requirements management  modeling  testing  change and configuration management  increased sales capacity  and increased sales activity with customers across the majority of our products 
consulting and support revenues 
consulting and support revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal this increase reflects increased revenues related to maintenance contracts  growing demand for our consulting expertise in advanced software development practices and continued strong sales and renewals for customer support 
international sales 
during fiscal and  international revenues from product sales and related consulting and customer support were million and million  respectively  representing of total revenues in both fiscal and the growth in international sales during fiscal was due principally to increase sales and marketing activities in international markets from all regions 
revenues from europe increased million  or  in fiscal  while revenues from the asia pacific and other international regions increased million  or 
our international sales are principally priced in local currencies 
we enter into short term forward currency contracts to hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on balance sheet exposures denominated in currencies other than the local  or functional  currency of our subsidiaries or us 
the total amount of these contracts is approximately offset by the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and such contracts are carried at fair market value 
the associated gains and losses were not material to our results of operations in any period presented 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists principally of materials  packaging and freight  amortization of purchased technology  and royalties 
cost of product revenues increased in fiscal compared with fiscal these costs represented and of net product revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the decrease in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product sales was primarily a result of increased efficiencies achieved in the current year by outsourcing fulfillment activities and a reduction of printing costs for materials currently being delivered electronically 
cost of consulting and support revenues 
cost of consulting and support revenues consists principally of personnel costs for training  consulting  and customer support 
cost of consulting and support revenues increased in fiscal compared with fiscal these costs represented and of consulting and support revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the increase in cost was primarily a result of increased personnel costs necessary to support the growing demand for consulting  support and education and correlates to the increase in consulting and support revenues 
the increase is in line with our increase in consulting and support revenues in fiscal operating expenses research and development 
total expenditures for research and development r d increased in fiscal compared with fiscal research and development costs represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to the cost of additional personnel and related costs incurred in maintaining existing products and developing new product releases 
additionally  the increase was attributable to additional costs incurred by catapulse inc catapulse 
the costs incurred by catapulse increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we did not capitalize any software development costs for our software to be sold or marketed in fiscal and because eligible costs were not material 
we expect the amount of software development costs capitalized in future periods will be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position because the time period and the engineering effort required between demonstration of a product s economic and technological feasibility and the date of product release has been very short 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal these expenses represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in sales and marketing expenses reflected the additional personnel  commissions  and related costs required in sales and marketing departments to expand our sales channels  penetrate new markets  and increase our market share in core markets and sales and marketing costs incurred by catapulse 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from increased employee related expenses associated with staffing requirements needed to support our expanding business 
amortization of goodwill  purchased intangibles  and deferred stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we acquired attol testware  the remaining outstanding shares of catapulse not already owned by rational  and certain other intellectual property and intangible assets  which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded goodwill and purchased intangibles representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in fiscal  we acquired objectime limited  which was also accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the goodwill and purchased intangibles are being amortized over their expected useful lives  which were determined to be from one to four years 
the aggregate amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
also as part of the acquisitions of attol testware and the remaining outstanding shares of catapulse in fiscal  we recorded million of deferred compensation relating to the unvested stock options and restricted stock assumed in the acquisitions 
the amortization of deferred stock based compensation was approximately million during fiscal in fiscal  in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees of catapulse  the results of which were consolidated with rational s results  we recorded deferred compensation of million representing the difference between the deemed value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
the amortization of deferred stock based compensation in fiscal was approximately million 
charges for acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisitions of attol testware and the remaining outstanding shares of catapulse  we recorded charges for acquired in process research and development ipr d in the amount of million and million  respectively  in fiscal in connection with the acquisition of objectime limited  we recorded million of ipr d in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

purchase of the remaining outstanding shares of catapulse not already owned by rational in connection with the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of catapulse not already owned by rational in fiscal  we allocated million of the total purchase price of million to ipr d projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows related to research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not reached technological feasibility 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
management is primarily responsible for estimating the fair value of ipr d  which they also determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser 
at the acquisition date  catapulse was developing a hosted development service to be delivered to users over the internet 
the hosted development service or hds  includes a set of hosted development tools  web based collaboration services  a complete infrastructure for the development and reuse of intellectual property and a secure development platform 
the technologies under development were approximately complete 
we allocated values to ipr d based on the stage of development of each product and service offering  the time and resources needed to complete each product and service offering  and the expected income and associated risks 
the value assigned to acquired ipr d was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products and service offering  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the products and service offering  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the ipr d was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product and service introductions by catapulse and its competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such product and service offering are based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such product and service offering 
aggregate revenues for the developmental catapulse product and service offering were estimated to grow based on forecasted sales for the three years following introduction  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on an estimated cost of capital calculation 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  a discount rate of was considered appropriate for the ipr d 
this discount rate was commensurate with catapulse s stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the estimates used by us in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur

interest expense interest expense increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal was primarily a result of the convertible subordinated notes  which we sold and on which we began incurring interest expense for the last quarter of fiscal the total interest expense related to convertible subordinated notes was approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal and interest income interest income has fluctuated as a result of operating results and the amount of cash available for investment in interest bearing accounts 
interest income increased million to million in fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal was due primarily to an increase in cash and cash equivalents as a result of annual operating income  the cash received in connection with the million convertible subordinated notes offering in the last quarter of fiscal  and interest earned by catapulse  offset by a reduction of cash used for repurchase of company stock 
income taxes the income tax provisions for fiscal and differ from tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due to the impact of nondeductible charges for acquired in process research and development  goodwill  merger related costs  and foreign losses resulting in no us tax benefit  as well as foreign and state income taxes  offset by earnings permanently reinvested in offshore operations  the realized benefit of net operating loss carryforwards  and research credit carryforwards 
net cumulative undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries considered permanently reinvested amounted to approximately million at march  accordingly  no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in years through we also had tax credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  that expire in years through  if not utilized

under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against the future amortization of certain intangible assets 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
fiscal years ended march  and revenues total revenues increased in fiscal compared with fiscal net product revenues 
net product revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal this increase was a result of strong customer acceptance of the rational suite family of products  continued strong customer acceptance of our existing products  including products for requirements management  modeling  testing  change  and configuration management  increased sales capacity  and increased sales activity with internet related customers across the majority of our products

merger and integration costs 
in fiscal  we substantially completed certain elements of the organizational integration following the july pure atria merger 
this consisted primarily of exiting certain non strategic consulting activities  realignment of marketing activities  and consolidation of certain sales offices 
in the december quarter  charges related to this activity  totaling approximately million  were primarily for severance costs associated with employee terminations  and charges associated with facilities closures 
these charges were offset by a reduction of previously accrued facilities expenses related to the pure atria merger totaling million 
the facilities expense reduction was due to greater than expected recoveries from subleasing 
the net impact in fiscal was a merger and integration cost reduction of million 
the net cost reduction of million is the result of ongoing assessment and estimation of costs associated with the prior combinations of rational and other companies

we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources at march  as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of billion and working capital of million

these were offset primarily by the change in minority interest in the loss of catapulse inc  increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  and decreases in accrued merger and integration expenses and net deferred tax liability 
total cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments for the period ended march   was million and working capital was million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the period ended march   was composed primarily of net income plus noncash charges for depreciation and amortization  charges for acquired ipr d  noncash merger and integration costs  tax benefits from employee stock plans  increases in accrued employee benefits and accrued expenses  income taxes payable  and deferred revenues and a decrease in deferred tax assets 
these were offset primarily by increases in accounts receivable  and prepaid expenses and a decrease in accounts payable

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from net proceeds from issuance of common stock under the employee stock plans of million  reissuance of treasury stock under employee stock plans of million  and proceeds received from minority investors in catapulse of million 
this was offset by million used to repurchase common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from net proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated notes of million  issuance of common stock under the employee stock plans of million  and proceeds received from minority investors in catapulse of million 
this was offset by million used to repurchase common stock 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from million used to repurchase common stock and million used to decrease long term debt  offset by million received from issuance of common stock under the employee stock plans 
in april  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock in the open market to be used for general corporate purposes 
we completed that repurchase program during the september quarter 
in october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of our common stock in the open market to be used for general corporate purposes 
through march   we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock  including repurchases authorized in april and october  for a total cash outlay of approximately million 
in april  the broad of directors authorized the purchase of an additional million shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market 
repurchases help offset dilution from stock issued under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
in fiscal  we completed an offering of convertible subordinated notes the notes  which mature on february  the interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed  at a conversion price of per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
we believe that expected cash flow from operations combined with existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next months and the foreseeable future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in known or forecasted currency exchange rates 
foreign currency risk a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the local or functional currency of our subsidiaries or us may adversely affect operating results 
we enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on balance sheet exposures denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the total amount of these contracts is approximately offset by the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
forward contracts are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations when the related transactions being hedged are recognized or the contracts mature 
such contracts meet the criteria established in sfas  foreign currency translation for hedge accounting treatment 
we are required to adopt sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in fiscal based on our current hedging activities and the effectiveness of our hedging programs experienced in fiscal  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
as we find it impractical to hedge all foreign currency exposures  we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hold or issue leveraged derivative financial instruments 
at march  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts  all having maturities of less than days  to exchange various nonfunctional currencies for us dollars or euros in the aggregate contracted amounts us dollar equivalent of million and million  respectively 
the net gains and losses associated with all forward exchange contracts in fiscal   and are not material to the our results of operations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio
