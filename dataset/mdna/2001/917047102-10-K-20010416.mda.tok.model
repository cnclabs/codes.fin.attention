weaker sales created a greater proportionate need for clearance markdowns and a deleveraging of store related expenses  which combined with increased occupancy costs  ultimately resulted in a negative impact on earnings that more than offset the impact of overall sales growth and the company s cost containment efforts 
the reduction in net income as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a net charge to earnings of million to recognize a required accounting reserve for the company s portion of operating losses relating to its minority investment in mxg media  inc see other matters mxg media  inc
