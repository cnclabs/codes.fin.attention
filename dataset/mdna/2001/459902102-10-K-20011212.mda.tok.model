item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we operate principally in two lines of business the development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of gaming products  which we refer to as product sales  and the development  marketing and operation of wap systems  stand alone games and gaming equipment leasing  which we refer to as proprietary gaming 
our proprietary gaming segment includes our wholly owned gaming operations and our unconsolidated joint venture activities reported as earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal year net income reached a record of million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal  excluding one time items discussed below 
fiscal net income of million or per diluted share included the effects of the following one time events o a gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share from a legal settlement  o a loss of million  net of tax or per diluted share on the sale of the gaming systems business unit previously purchased as part of the olympic gaming acquisition  and o a gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share on the sale of the japanese subsidiary of barcrest 
operating income fiscal operating income totaled million  a increase over fiscal operating income of million 
operating margins were and for fiscal and this substantial growth was driven by improved margins in both the product sales and proprietary gaming segments 
revenues  earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and gross profit margins total revenues for fiscal grew to billion compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
product sales and gaming operations posted substantial gains  increasing and over the prior year 
both areas also contributed to the overall gross profit of million for the current fiscal year versus million in fiscal product sales reached an all time high of million on shipments of  units worldwide for fiscal comparatively  fiscal sales totaled million on shipments of  units 
a increase in domestic shipments drove this improvement  with  units in fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
replacement sales of  machines domestically represented a increase over fiscal replacement sales were especially strong in the nevada  midwestern and native american markets 
igt innovations in slot technology such as multi denomination tm games and ez pay tm games and systems along with strong player acceptance of new games helped stimulate these replacement sales 
fiscal sales of  machines into the new california native american market contributed significantly to the increase 
igt also provided gaming machines to several new casinos during the current year including the texas casino  palms casino and green valley ranch in las vegas  and the san manuel in california 
international shipments declined to  units in fiscal versus  units during fiscal japanese shipments slowed to  compared to  in the prior year due to difficulties experienced in bringing popular new games to the market 
australia realized improvements from the standardization of its product line resulting in unit sales of  a increase over the prior year 
slight declines were experienced by the uk  europe and africa  with offsetting improvements in latin america 
product sales margins rose to during fiscal compared to in fiscal as a result of volume efficiencies and a higher percentage of domestic sales 
proprietary gaming  which includes our wholly owned gaming operations and our unconsolidated joint venture activities reported as earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  also reached record levels in fiscal this business segment produced revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates totaling million during the current year compared to million in fiscal the combination of the ongoing popularity of our established proprietary games  such as item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations wheel of fortune r  and the successful introduction of new games again drove positive financial results 
the newest games in our proprietary games family  jeopardy r video slots  the addams family tm  austin powers tm  the price is right tm and the  pyramid tm along with the joint venture game i dream of jeannie tm  contributed significantly to the overall improvement 
the total installed base of our proprietary games  including joint venture and strategic alliance games  topped  units  a growth rate of over the prior year s installed base of  games 
gross margin contributions from proprietary gaming totaled million in  higher than the million recorded in fiscal the resulting gross profit percentage declined two percentage points in fiscal to 
significant interest rate cuts during the current year adversely impacted our cost of funding jackpot payments 
the fiscal installed base also had a larger percentage of theme games  which entailed additional royalty costs 
in recognition that all games have a finite lifecycle  igt systematically replaces legacy proprietary games experiencing declining play levels with new games incorporating enhanced entertainment value and improved player appeal 
during fiscal  we removed proprietary systems games in eight jurisdictions 
at september   igt operated proprietary games in domestic jurisdictions  as well as one international system in iceland versus domestic jurisdictions and one international location at the end of fiscal operating expenses operating expenses  excluding impairment and restructuring charges  totaled million or of total revenues in fiscal versus million or of revenues for the prior year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million as a result of higher variable commission and incentive costs  along with additional legal and compliance costs in support of stronger sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization expense  not included in cost of sales  declined slightly to million 
research and development expenses for fiscal were million as compared to million in additional personnel and related costs to support our commitment to innovative game development resulted in this increase 
bad debt expense increased million related to increased sales volume and specific reserves related to international receivables 
other income and expense other expense  net  totaled million for the current year compared to million for the prior year 
the primary difference in the two periods relates to the aforementioned legal settlement received in fiscal additionally  gains on investments declined million based on corporate cash investment timing and market conditions 
our worldwide tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal we expect our tax rate for fiscal to fluctuate between and 
business segments operating profit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements igt s operating profit by business segment reflects an appropriate allocation of selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  interest income and interest expense 
product sales operating profit grew to million or of related revenues for the fiscal year compared to million or for fiscal this significant improvement reflects the growth in domestic sales partially offset by increased research and development costs 
in fiscal  operating profit for the proprietary gaming segment reached million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this improvement resulted from the growth of the installed base of our proprietary machines and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the popularity of both the established games such as wheel of fortune r and our newer proprietary games themes 
this improvement was slightly offset by the increased cost of funding jackpot payments and higher royalty costs as discussed previously 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net income  excluding one time items discussed below  totaled million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal both fiscal years included several one time items that affected net income 
fiscal net income of million or per diluted share included the effects of the following one time events o a gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share from a legal settlement  o a loss of million  net of tax or per diluted share on the sale of the gaming systems business unit previously purchased as part of the olympic gaming acquisition  and o a gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share on the sale of the japanese subsidiary of barcrest 
prior year net income of million or per diluted share included the following one time items o an impairment and restructuring charges of million million net of tax or per diluted share related to operations in australia and brazil  and o an extraordinary loss on early redemption of debt of million million net of tax or per diluted share 
the legal settlement gain  received in the first quarter of fiscal  resulted from the resolution of legal actions between igt and wms related to infringement claims involving our telnaes patent for virtual reel technology 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the total unamortized balance of intangible assets related to the olympic acquisition was fully impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the reasons for the impairment charge 
after difficulties experienced with the acquisition of olympic  we initiated a significant restructuring plan in late fiscal in an effort to return igt australia to a profitable operation 
the changes implemented in fiscal included narrowing the product lines  downsizing the sales  service  and engineering departments  and transferring manufacturing to reno 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized restructuring costs of million related to this plan 
an additional million in restructuring costs were incurred during fiscal related to the elimination of certain administrative and manufacturing positions in australia 
although our australian subsidiary recorded an operating loss for the year  the financial results continued to improve each quarter culminating with a profit recorded in the fourth quarter  the first profitable quarter in several years 
in the fourth quarter of  the brazilian government rescinded the law allowing gaming devices in bingo halls 
based on our assessment of the recoverability of our inventories and receivables in brazil at october   we recorded impairment charges of million 
during fiscal  we received payment of million for receivables and inventories previously considered fully impaired 
in july  in a move to eliminate duplication within our operations in japan  we sold barcrest kk  the japanese subsidiary of barcrest  for a gain of million million net of tax 
the net cash proceeds from the sale were million and the net assets disposed of were million 
the purchaser is a japanese company engaged in the manufacture  development  and sale of pachinko and pachisuro slot machines 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating income fiscal operating income  before impairment and restructuring charges  grew to million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the prior year 
this improvement was due to the increased gross profit margins in both product sales and gaming operations and gains in the earnings of our unconsolidated affiliates  partially offset by higher operating expenses  as discussed below 
revenues  earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and gross profit margins total revenues for fiscal improved to million over fiscal revenues of million  reflecting a increase in product sales and a increase in gaming operations 
this improvement was due to continued growth in our domestic revenues  which increased by over the prior year 
gross profit on total revenues for fiscal increased by to million compared to million for fiscal this improvement was attributable to growth in profitability year over year for both product sales and gaming operations 
worldwide  igt shipped  gaming machines for product sales of million in fiscal versus  units for million in the prior fiscal year 
domestic shipments increased to  units for fiscal from  units in fiscal  predominantly due to sales of approximately  units into the new california native american market 
fiscal domestic shipments to new casinos also included suncoast in nevada  hollywood casino in louisiana  belterra resort in indiana  and greektown casino in michigan 
although fiscal offered fewer major casino openings than fiscal  domestic replacement sales were up for the fourth quarter and for the year compared to the same prior year periods  led by strong demand for our newer games 
international shipments  comprising of total units in fiscal  declined to  units compared to  units in fiscal this decline reflected a slower year in japan and latin america  partially offset by increased unit sales in europe  africa  and the united kingdom 
unit sales in australia were virtually flat year over year  but improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the prior year quarter  reflecting improvement from the restructuring plan implemented during fiscal the gross profit percentage on product sales improved to for fiscal compared to in the prior year 
margins were positively impacted by a higher percentage of domestic sales in the overall mix  offset by additional costs associated with sourcing more sophisticated electronic components and the rapid production ramp up in the latter half of the year 
gaming operations revenue  for the year ended september  improved to million compared to million in fiscal the gross profit performance in gaming operations climbed to million or for fiscal from million or in fiscal the inclusion of sodak s gaming operations revenues and the impact of higher interest rates  which lowered the cost of funding jackpot payments were the most significant contributors to this margin growth 
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  a separate component of operating income reported net of expenses for accounting purposes  boosted by the continued popularity of the wheel of fortune r games  grew to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal performance of our proprietary gaming segment  which includes our wholly owned gaming operations and our unconsolidated joint venture activities  accelerated markedly in fiscal due to significant placements of our newest and most popular game themes 
the installed base of our proprietary games  including placement under joint ventures  at september  experienced year over year growth of to  games from  machines at the end of fiscal our joint venture activities contributed significantly to this growth  led by the installation of  video and spinning reel wheel of fortune r games during the year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations also contributing to the overall growth in proprietary gaming were the successes of multi hand poker tm  party time r  elvis r and the addams family tm games 
fiscal brought the installation of new feature rich proprietary games with second event bonusing  incorporating popular themes such as the addams family tm and jeopardy r video 
during fiscal  we discontinued proprietary game systems in eight jurisdictions 
as of september   our proprietary games operated in domestic jurisdictions and one international location versus domestic jurisdictions and one international location at the end of fiscal operating expenses fiscal operating expenses  excluding impairment and restructuring charges  totaled million or of total revenue compared to million or in fiscal the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the inclusion of sodak s operating expenses and increased incentives as the result of improved operating results 
depreciation and amortization expense  not included in cost of sales  declined from the prior year to million  primarily due to the write off of intangible assets in australia in the fourth quarter of fiscal the addition of goodwill and fixed assets relating to the acquisition of sodak partially offset this decline 
research and development expenses increased million to million for fiscal  primarily as a result of engineering expenses related to new game development 
bad debt expense increased million over fiscal primarily due to fluctuations in sales volumes 
other income and expense other expense  net  for fiscal totaled million versus million in the prior year 
increased interest expense from our outstanding billion senior notes issued in may was partially offset by the million legal settlement received 
operation of our megajackpots tm systems results in interest income from both the investment of cash and from investments purchased to fund jackpot payments 
interest expense on the jackpot liability is accrued at the rate earned on the investments purchased to fund the liability 
therefore  interest income and expense relating to funding jackpot winners are similar and increase at approximately the same rate based on the growth in total jackpot winners 
our worldwide tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal business segments operating profit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements igt s operating profit by business segment reflects an appropriate allocation of selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  interest income and interest expense 
product sales operating profit  before impairment and restructuring charges  for the year ended september  improved to million or of related revenues compared to million or in fiscal including the one time charges for impairment and restructuring of million  product sales operating loss for the year ended october  was million 
this fluctuation reflects increased sales volume  offset by increased research and development costs  and increased interest expense allocated to the product sales segment from our billion senior notes proceeds used to fund the acquisition of sodak in september in fiscal  operating profit for the proprietary gaming segment totaled million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year 
this improvement resulted from the growth of our installed base and excellent player acceptance of our new proprietary games  the continued popularity of the joint venture wheel of fortune r games  higher interest rates which lowered the cost of funding jackpot payments  and the inclusion of gaming operations revenue from sodak 
foreign operations approximately of our revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal were derived outside of north america 
to date  we have not experienced significant translation or transaction losses related to foreign exchange fluctuations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital resources one of igt s fundamental financial strengths is our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business 
we anticipate that our operating activities in fiscal will continue to provide us with cash flows to assist in our business expansion and to meet our financial commitments 
our sources of capital also include  but are not limited to  the issuance of public or private placement debt  bank borrowings  and the issuance of equity securities 
we believe that our available short term and long term capital resources are sufficient to fund our capital expenditure and operating capital requirements  scheduled debt payments  interest and income tax obligations  strategic investments and acquisitions  and share repurchases 
our sources of capital afford us the financial flexibility to target acquisitions of businesses that offer opportunities to implement our operating strategies  increase our rates of return  and improve shareholder value 
operating activities cash provided by operations in fiscal totaled million  an increase of from  primarily as the result of favorable operating performance discussed earlier 
fiscal cash provided by operations totaled million  a decrease of from fiscal operating cash flow benefited from the one time realization of accumulated deferred tax assets related to the timing of the jackpot payments for tax purposes  as the result of federal legislation passed in october this new law allowed previous  as well as future  jackpot winners to elect to receive lump sum discounted payments in lieu of future annual installments 
net cash flow from proprietary progressive jackpot systems our proprietary progressive jackpot systems provide cash through collections from systems to fund jackpot liabilities and from maturities of us government securities purchased to fund future annual jackpot payments 
cash is used to make payments to jackpot winners for jackpot liabilities or to purchase us government securities to fund future jackpot payments 
the purchase of and proceeds from the us government securities are classified as investing activities 
collections from systems to fund jackpot liabilities and payments on jackpot liabilities are classified as financing activities 
net cash flows from these activities represent timing differences between the growth in liabilities for jackpots and the actual payments to the winners during the period 
fluctuations in net cash flows from systems occur based on the timing of the jackpot cycles and the volume of play across all of our proprietary progressive jackpot systems 
net cash flow from these activities collectively provided cash of million in fiscal and used cash of million and million in fiscal and fiscal investing activities in  investing activities used an additional million in cash compared to this increase was the result of business acquisition costs during and a decrease in proceeds from disposals of investments and other assets 
fiscal included million in proceeds from sale of the miss marquette riverboat  a held for sale asset acquired in the purchase of sodak in fiscal fiscal provided cash from investing of million compared to a use of investing cash in of million primarily related to business acquisitions

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations total capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment and the percentage distribution by geographic operating segment for fiscal   and are as follows fiscal years amounts in thousands capital expenditures    domestic international the increase in fiscal spending is primarily due to investments to improve the productivity of operations 
a portion of fiscal spending was used to update our internal software systems with an enterprise resource planning erp solution and software to support our engineering activities 
the erp project is expected to be phased in over the next two years 
financing activities net cash flow from financing activities used million in  million in  and provided cash of million in the change between and was primarily due to decreased purchases of treasury stock 
the fluctuation between and was primarily due to increased borrowings related to our billion senior notes issued in may stock repurchase plan our board of directors originally authorized igt s stock repurchase plan in october as of november   the remaining share repurchase authorization  as amended  totaled million additional shares 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate price of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate price of million  including million shares repurchased pursuant to an issuer tender offer at per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate price of million 
credit facilities and indebtedness our domestic and foreign borrowing facilities totaled million at september  of this amount  million was drawn  million was reserved for letters of credit and the remaining million was available for future borrowings 
we are required to comply with certain covenants contained in these agreements  which  among other things  limit financial commitments we may make without the written consent of the lenders and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at september   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
in may  we completed the private placement of billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the senior notes were issued in two tranches million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  due may   priced at and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  due may   priced at 
in august  we exchanged all outstanding senior notes for identical registered notes 
a portion of the proceeds was used to redeem previously outstanding senior notes due  which resulted in a prepayment penalty of million  net of tax 
additionally  we repaid outstanding borrowings under both our us and australian credit facilities 
the remaining net proceeds from the offering were used to fund our acquisition of sodak  working capital  and share repurchases 
the issuance of our billion of senior notes could have important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of interest on our indebtedness and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and disadvantaging us compared to competitors with less indebtedness 
the indenture contains a number of covenants  which restricts our ability to incur indebtedness  create or incur liens on our assets  or enter into sale leaseback transactions 
at september   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations on the senior notes and our other indebtedness will depend on our future performance 
in addition  our bank revolving line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial ratio tests 
our ability to maintain such ratio tests will also depend on our future performance 
our future performance will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we were unable to maintain the financial ratio tests under the bank revolving line of credit  the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if this happened  other indebtedness that contains cross default or cross acceleration provisions  including the senior notes  may also be accelerated and become due and payable 
if any of these events should occur  we may not be able to pay such amounts 
at september   we had million outstanding in long term debt  net of unamortized discount compared to million at september  financial condition september  september  amounts in thousands total assets   total liabilities   total stockholders equity   total assets increased million or during fiscal primarily due to increases in cash  receivables  and inventories related to higher sales volumes and timing 
intangible assets grew predominantly due to the acquisition of silicon in march see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant  and equipment increased due to capital expenditures during the year  net of depreciation expense  and from the non cash transfer of machines from inventory to gaming systems equipment 
the increase in other assets related to increased royalty prepayments 
total liabilities at september  increased million or primarily related to sales volume and payment timing 
lower interest rates also contributed to increased jackpot liabilities 
other liabilities increased related to marketing commitments and accrued income taxes 
long term notes payable decreased related to the repurchase of million of our senior notes 
total stockholders equity increased million predominantly related to net income generated during the year  offset by treasury stock repurchases 
additional paid in capital increased as the result of employee stock plans

these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we adopted sfas on october  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab clarifies existing accounting principles related to revenue recognition in financial statements and was effective beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued two new standards  sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
together these statements will change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
thus  amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will cease upon adoption of sfas amortization will still be required for identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
the provisions of sfas are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  early application is permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after march   provided that the first interim financial statements have not previously been issued 
we are required to adopt sfas at the beginning of our fiscal year we have not yet completed our analysis of the impact that sfas and sfas will have on our financial condition or results of operations

this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   which would be igt s fiscal we have not yet completed our analysis of the impact that sfas will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
reclassifications certain amounts in the prior years comparative consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the presentation used in the current fiscal year 
euro currency conversions on january   of member countries of the european union fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and one common currency the euro 
conversion to the euro eliminated currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued and the former currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established and are implementing plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include the need to adapt financial systems and business processes  changes required to equipment  such as coin validators and note acceptors  to accommodate euro denominated transactions in our current products  and the impact of one common currency on pricing 
we do not expect material system and equipment conversion costs related exclusively to the euro 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects that one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative factors about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  igt is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the program is operated pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies 
the counter parties to these instruments are major financial institutions and we believe that credit loss in the event of nonperformance is remote 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we routinely use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the non functional currency monetary assets and liabilities of our operations 
the primary business objective of this hedging program is to minimize the impact to our earnings resulting from exchange rate changes 
we had forward contracts totaling million and million at the end of fiscal and to hedge currency exposures of million and million 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
there were no firm commitment hedges at the end of the current or prior year periods 
given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
igt does not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international operating results include the australian dollar  the british pound and the japanese yen 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating results by less than million in the current fiscal year compared to less than million in the prior year 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk igt s results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in bank lending rates and the cost of us government securities used to fund liabilities to jackpot winners 
we record expense for future jackpots based on these rates  which are impacted by market interest rates and other economic conditions 
therefore  the gross profit on our proprietary gaming segment decreases when interest rates decline 
we estimated that a decline in interest rates would have impacted gaming operations gross profit by million in fiscal and million in we also estimated that a decline in interest rates would have impacted earnings of unconsolidated affiliates by million in fiscal and million in igt currently does not manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative factors about market risk igt grants customers extended payment terms under contracts of sale secured by the equipment sold and occasionally provides loans to customers for other than gaming equipment 
these contracts and notes are generally for terms of one to ten years  with interest recognized at prevailing rates 
within our portfolio  we have both fixed and variable rate notes and contracts receivable 
if interest rates decreased by  we estimated the interest income for our variable rate notes and contracts would be impacted by approximately  in fiscal and  in if interest rates increased by  we estimated the fair value of the fixed rate notes and contracts would have decreased by approximately  at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of our outstanding senior notes carry interest at fixed rates 
if interest rates increased by  the fair market value of these notes would have decreased approximately million at september  and million at september
