item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in many cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  intend or continue  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we have developed a general purpose digital rights management  or drm  platform to serve as a foundation for providers of digital information  technology  and commerce services to participate in a global e commerce system 
intertrust was formed and incorporated in january from inception through  our efforts were principally devoted to research and development  raising capital  recruiting personnel  and establishing licensing relationships 
as a result  we were considered a development stage enterprise during this period 
the general availability version of our commerce software was not delivered to our partners until december some partners began using the technology on a limited commercial basis in january we license our drm platform and software to companies to build digital commerce services and applications 
our goal is to license to content  technology  and commerce services partners to achieve widespread dissemination of our technology  an expanding consumer base  and broad participation by digital information providers 
we currently derive of our revenues from initial license fees  associated software support and training services  trustnet clearinghouse services  professional services  and the sale of chips containing our drm technology 
our license agreements also generally require our partners to pay a transaction fee that is a percentage of amounts paid by users or charged by our partners in commercial transactions and services that use our technology  and for sales of products incorporating our technology 
some of our license agreements relating to uses of our technology within enterprises for privately managing proprietary data may require a per user fee 
within the next several years  we anticipate that a significant portion of our revenues will be derived primarily from transaction fees 
any future transaction fees are dependent on the success of our licensees and their customers in commercially deploying services and applications 
we are targeting relationships that will establish our drm platform in several markets  including entertainment  business information  and publishing 
to date  a significant part of our licensing efforts has been focused on adoption of our technology by the music industry as we believe it will be an early implementer of drm technology 
we believe that if our general purpose platform is adopted in the music market  we will be positioned to have our platform adopted in additional markets including video and publishing 
we have four basic types of license agreements commerce service licenses  business licenses  applications licenses and hardware licenses 
these agreements provide different rights and technology depending on the commercial plans of our partners 
initial license fees received from these agreements may vary in amount depending on factors such as partner commitments  scope of the license as it relates to commercial markets  territory  and term of agreement 
examples of partner commitments include deploying licensed products within a specified time frame  exclusively using portions of our technology  and using and publicly promoting us as the partner s preferred digital rights management technology 
we have in the past decided  and may in the future decide  to reduce or eliminate initial license fees based on these factors 
we do not believe that we can determine the amount of foregone revenue due to reduced or eliminated license fees with any reliable degree of certainty 
our license fees are negotiated based on the terms and conditions of each individual agreement and take into account the scope of the license  the term  and the other commitments made by our partners that provide strategic value to us 
in addition  we have entered into a limited number of license agreements which have varying license scopes and terms and which do not provide adequate comparable data to determine the amount of foregone revenue 
in connection with our strategy to promote widespread use of our technology  through december   we have on three occasions received initial license fees for our commerce software in the form of minority equity positions in the licensees 
additionally  on five occasions we received initial license fees in the form of convertible promissory notes 
in the future  we may enter into other equity payment arrangements 
licenses of our commerce software generally require the payment of an initial license fee 
initial license revenue  net of any discounts granted  is recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of our software if we have no remaining obligations relating to development  upgrades  new releases  or other future deliverables  if the license fee is fixed or determinable  and if collection of the fee is probable 
our license agreements generally include the right to obtain access to upgrades and new releases  on a when and if available basis  for a specified period 
under these circumstances  the license payments received  net of any discounts granted  in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recognized on a subscription basis over the period of obligation beginning upon delivery of the licensed product 
in addition  under license agreements where we are obligated to provide a specified custom development deliverable and do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the specified deliverable  all of the license revenue is deferred until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
upon delivery of the specified deliverable  license revenue is recognized using the subscription method 
we began recognizing revenue under some license agreements in january  after shipping the general availability version of our commerce software at the end of december at december   we had approximately million of deferred license revenue that will be recognized in future periods 
through december   on three occasions we received license fees in the form of minority equity positions in non public entities 
on five occasions we received license fees in the form of convertible promissory notes from non public entities in exchange for technology licenses 
one of these convertible promissory notes was already converted into  shares of common stock which we believe represented approximately of the outstanding shares of the licensee as of the conversion date 
because the entities were recently formed  privately held companies  and intertrust was unable to obtain sufficient evidence of the fair value of the common stock of the entity or sufficient evidence of the fair value of the convertible promissory notes and collectibility was not probable  intertrust did not record revenue or deferred revenue from the license fees 
intertrust is obligated to provide unspecified upgrades and new releases  on a when and if available basis  to the licensees over a one to two year period under the agreements for additional fees 
intertrust is not obligated to provide any funding to any licensee for the development of the licensee s software 
our license agreements also require the payment of a transaction fee that is a percentage of revenues received by our partners from transactions and services that use our technology and sales of products incorporating our technology 
transactions involving the use of our technology to conduct the sale  lease  rental  or licensing of commercial content require the payment of a transaction fee based on the amounts paid by users or charged by our partners for selling or distributing the content 
transactions involving the use of our technology for commercial services generally require the payment of a transaction fee based on the amounts paid by users or charged by our partners for the services 
transactions involving the sale  lease  rental  or licensing of products incorporating our technology generally require the payment of a transaction fee based on the amounts paid by users or charged by our partners for the product 
our partners are required to pay all amounts due for transaction fees within specified periods  depending on the licensing arrangement 
our revenue recognition policy relating to transaction fees is to recognize the revenue when the amounts due are known  which will generally be in the quarter after the transaction 
prepaid transaction fees are recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized when the related transactions occur 
we have received million in prepaid transaction fees which are included in deferred revenue as of december  prepaid transaction fees may generally be offset against a portion of transaction fee amounts due in any given quarter 
to date  we have not recognized any material transaction fees from commercial transactions or services  or sales of products 
software support and training services  which typically include the right to telephone and online support and customer training  are generally provided for in the license agreements for an agreed upon amount 
software support and training service revenue is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 
trustnet clearinghouse service revenues represent primarily service fees from our customers for the use of our trustnet clearinghouse infrastructure in pilot and test applications and services 
service revenues generally include consulting and system integration services provided to the customer to establish an interface with the trustnet clearinghouse and monthly service fees to use trustnet for the clearing of commercial transactions 
consulting and system integration fees are recognized as services are performed and monthly service fees are recognized over the term of the service period 
professional services represent fees for consulting services provided to our customers for development and system integration not essential to the functionality of the software licensed 
the revenue from these services is recognized as services are performed 
hardware revenue is comprised of sales of chips containing our software to a single customer  who is also a licensee of our technology  and with whom we have a short term contract to provide chips for testing and trial production 
the revenue from the sale of chips is recognized as the chips are shipped 
through the end of  we had a limited number of licensees 
pricewaterhousecoopers  national computer systems of singapore  and bertelsmann accounted for  and of total revenues respectively  in mitsubishi  a stockholder  reciprocal  and computacenter accounted for   and of total revenues  respectively  in our success depends on significantly increasing the number of companies that license our technology and use it for the sale and management of digital content and services 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our industry and our new and unproven business model  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
in addition  our business model has not succeeded in generating sufficient revenue to sustain our business 
we also operate in an intensely competitive market for highly qualified technical  sales and marketing  and management personnel and periodically make salary and other compensation adjustments to retain and hire employees 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will substantially increase in future quarters 
as a result  we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
in addition  we have limited and delayed insight on consumer trends and sales  which makes prediction of our future revenues difficult 
we expect to incur additional losses for at least the next several years 
in january  we signed a purchase agreement with publishone inc publishone  a developer of online publishing software solutions and distribution services for business information publishers 
prior to the acquisition  intertrust owned approximately of publishone s stock 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired the remaining of the shares of publishone in exchange for  shares of our common stock with an approximate fair value of million and assumed all outstanding options of publishone  which were converted into options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an approximate fair value of million 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase with an estimated purchase price of million 
additionally  the agreement includes contingent consideration of  shares to be issued upon publishone meeting certain milestones  as specified in the agreement 
we are currently evaluating the acquisition  including the value of in process research and development  in order to determine the allocation of the purchase price for accounting purposes 
in december  we purchased technology and other assets from passedge corporation  a developer of software solutions for managing digital rights for internet based video broadcasting  in exchange for million in cash  acquisition related costs of  and  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million 
the purchase price of million was capitalized as purchased technology  fixed asset and other intangible assets 
we are amortizing the value of the technology acquired over its estimated useful life of approximately four years and the value of the other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives of approximately three years 
in march   we acquired infinite ink corporation  a developer of software solutions for rendering and protecting electronic publishing 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired all of the shares of infinite ink in exchange for  shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair value of million  and assumed  stock options with an aggregate fair value of million 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of infinite ink from the date of acquisition 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase with a total purchase price of million 
of this amount  million was expensed in march as purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development consisted of three projects to combine digital rights management with a software system that would allow users to securely purchase and view published content on their personal computers 
the projects in development were approximately complete at the time of acquisition and have been incorporated into our product 
our management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
we estimated the revenues  costs and resulting net cash flows from the project and discounted the net cash flows back to their net present value 
these estimates were based on several assumptions  including those summarized below 
the resulting value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation effort of infinite ink prior to the acquisition and further reduced by the estimated value of core technology  which was included in capitalized purchased technology 
as of december   we estimated that the projects in development were complete 
revenues and operating profit attributable to the in process research and development were estimated over a three year projection period 
the resulting projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value using a discount rate of  which was calculated based on the weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for the technology risk associated with the purchased in process research and development 
the technology risk was considered to be significant due to the rapid pace of technological change in the software industry 
the excess purchase price over the estimated value of the net tangible assets and in process research and development was allocated to various intangible assets 
million of the excess purchase price was capitalized as goodwill  and  was capitalized as the fair value of the assembled workforce 
the value of the assembled workforce was based upon the cost to replace that workforce 
the goodwill and value of assembled workforce will be amortized ratably over the estimated useful lives of five and three years  respectively 
in october  we purchased audio decoding and rendering technology and related assets and received a license to video technology from a third party  in exchange for  shares of our common stock and  in cash 
the purchase price of million was capitalized as purchased technology and included intangible assets 
we are amortizing the value of the technology acquired over its estimated useful life of approximately four years

we also provide trustnet clearinghouse services on a subscription basis 
additionally we provide professional services to our partners  which are recognized upon delivery 
the increase in services revenues in the quarters ended june  and december  were related to short term trustnet pilot agreements with new partners 
we began selling hardware in the quarter ended december  to one customer  who is also a licensee  under the terms of a short term purchase agreement to provide chips for testing and trial production 
cost of license revenue decreased in the quarter ended december  due to lower consulting and freight expenses 
quarter over quarter increases in the cost of software support and training services reflect the increased effort of engineering personnel to provide support services to our partners 
overall increases in research and development spending beginning in the quarter ended march  are primarily attributable to increased headcount and spending on software tools used in the development of our products 
the increases in sales and marketing spending since the quarter ended march  reflect additional headcount both domestically and internationally as well as increased expenses for travel  trade shows  public relations  and other promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses generally increased quarter over quarter  primarily as a result of increased legal and accounting personnel  costs associated with patent prosecution including filing and translation fees  and the use of outside patent counsel 
purchased in process research and development in the quarter ended march  was a one time charge related to an acquisition 
the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired began in the quarter ended june  we anticipate that research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as a result of new hires and related personnel costs 
sales and marketing spending is expected to increase as a result of our spending on branding  trade shows  advertising  and promotion 
we expect our revenues to vary 
if our revenue levels fall below our expectations  our net loss will increase because only a small portion of our expenses varies with our revenues 
in the future  our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable and restricted investments totaled million at december   an increase of million from december the increase in is primarily the result of cash generated from the net proceeds of million from a public offering of our common stock completed in april  in addition to proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases  offset by our net loss for of million 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in the cash used in is primarily attributable to the net loss of million and increases in accounts receivable of million  and prepaid and other current assets of million  partially offset by various non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of million  stock related compensation of million  loss on debt and equity investments of million  and purchased in process reasearch and development of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in the cash used in is primarily atributable to capital expenditures totaling million  net purchases of marketable and restricted investments totaling million  and million of investments in other non current assets and purchased technology 
capital acquisitions were principally comprised of office furniture and equipment for our new corporate facility and computer equipment and software used to support our product development and growing employee base 
although to date our requirements for capital expenditures have been moderate  we anticipate continued increase capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure  and personnel 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  primarily due to cash generated from our public offering in april and  to a lesser extent  from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable and restricted investments 
in january  we raised million from the sale of million shares to nokia corporation 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  and credit facilities with our equipment vendors  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next months 
in the future  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
additional financing may not be available at all or  if available  may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
in addition  any additional financing may be dilutive and new equity securities could have rights senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we need to raise funds and cannot do so on acceptable terms  we may not be able to respond to competitive pressures or anticipated requirements or take advantage of future opportunities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we develop products in the united states and license our products to partners in north america  europe  asia  and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected adversely by various factors  including foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our investments in marketable securities  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
at december  and december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of demand deposits and money market funds held by two large institutions in the united states
