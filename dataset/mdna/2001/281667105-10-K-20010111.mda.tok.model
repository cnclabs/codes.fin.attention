overview jd edwards is a leading provider of agile  collaborative solutions for the internet economy 
our open solutions give organizations the freedom to choose how they assemble internal applications and how they collaborate with partners and customers across the supply chain to increase competitive advantage 
for more than years  we have developed  marketed  and supported innovative  flexible solutions essential to running complex and fast moving multi national organizations helping over  customers of all sizes leverage existing investments and benefit from new technologies 
we distribute  implement  and support our products worldwide through offices and nearly third party business partners  including sales  consulting  and outsourcing partners with offices throughout the world 
our customers use our software at over  sites in more than countries 
our total revenue exceeded billion for fiscal compared to million in total revenue for fiscal  realizing the highest annual revenue achieved in our history 
this was driven by license fee revenue growth of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our financial results reflected an operating loss of million for fiscal  an improvement from an operating loss of million for fiscal our results were negatively impacted by the weakening of the euro and other foreign currencies against the us dollar during fiscal  and our operating loss was million greater as a result of the foreign exchange rates effective during fiscal compared the fiscal exchange rates 
included in the operating loss for fiscal was a restructuring charge of million and amortization of acquired software and other intangibles of million 
comparatively  the operating loss in fiscal included expenses for acquired in process research and development ipr d of million and amortization of acquired software and other intangibles totaling million 
the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share  an improvement from the net loss of million  or per share for fiscal reducing the reported net loss for fiscal was an million gain from sales of certain investments and a million gain related to the sale of a product line 
excluding all acquisition related charges  restructuring charges  and the gains on equity investments and product line sales  we reached a fiscal profit of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for fiscal on a comparable basis 
see other data regarding results of operations for a reconciliation of the comparable results for fiscal and during fiscal  we completed an acquisition of our longstanding business partner serving australia and new zealand  jd edwards new zealand  ltd 
jde nz  expanding our reach in the asia pacific region 
additionally  in fiscal  we completed acquisitions of two privately held companies  numetrix  ltd 
numetrix  and the premisys corporation 
these investments further extended our supply chain planning and fulfillment solutions as well as our ability to compete for business beyond the traditional enterprise software market 
all acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and  accordingly  operating expenses were impacted in fiscal and fiscal subsequent to the consummation dates of the acquisitions primarily as a result of ipr d charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  as well as other incremental operating expenses 
additionally  during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan directed towards reducing our infrastructure and operating expenses 
we will continue to realize savings from  among other things  the elimination of employee positions worldwide and a reduction in office space and related overhead expenses as a result of the restructuring plan 
we incurred a million restructuring charge during fiscal related to this restructuring plan 
for further details on the restructuring actions  see restructuring and related charges 
since  we have formed reseller and product right relationships with organizations whose products enhance our solutions 
this allows us to manage internal development resources  while at the same time offering our customers a broad spectrum of products and services 
we have signed reseller agreements with companies including siebel r systems  inc siebel  ariba r  inc 
ariba  extensity r  inc extensity  atlas commerce  and microstrategy  inc 
microstrategy 
the terms of each third party agreement vary  however  as we recognize license revenue under the reseller provisions in these agreements  a related royalty is charged to cost of license fees 
additionally  we have signed agreements with proforma  inc proforma  a provider of business process modeling solutions  webmethods  inc webmethods  formerly active software  inc  a provider of open solutions for business to business integration  and netfish technologies  inc netfish  a process integration provider 
the proforma  webmethods  and netfish agreements represent an investment in their products  embedded or currently being embedded into our oneworld r software 
these product investments are capitalized as software development costs during fiscal and are amortized to cost of license fees on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the functionality is integrated and available for general release in the jd edwards software solutions 
as a result of the reseller agreements and product investments  the gross margin on total license fee revenue has declined and may be reduced further in future years 
for fiscal  a limited portion of total license fee revenue was generated from sublicensing products included in reseller arrangements 
there can be no assurance that future license revenue from these third party arrangements will increase or will be sufficient to cover the cost of these agreements 
we historically have experienced and expect to continue to experience a high degree of seasonality 
because our operating expenses are typically relatively fixed in the near term  our operating margins have historically been significantly higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in other quarters  and we expect this to continue in future fiscal years 
first fiscal quarter revenue and results from operations historically have been lower than those in the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
we believe that these seasonal factors are common in the software industry 
see factors affecting the company s business  operating results  and financial condition our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations and a failure to meet expectations could adversely impact the price of our stock 
we believe that the traditional enterprise software market will continue to grow but at a slower pace than was evident in the past decade 
the traditional enterprise market focuses on automating internal operations  such as manufacturing  human resources  finance  and distribution 
many companies have already automated internal operations 
the traditional enterprise market is now largely a replacement market  we believe that companies will replace their enterprise software approximately every five to seven years 
while the traditional enterprise market slows somewhat  we believe that there will be strong growth in an emerging market generally described as collaborative commerce c commerce 
now that enterprises have largely automated their internal processes  they are turning their attention to automating external processes in order to achieve further competitive advantage 
external processes are those processes that link an enterprise with its customers  suppliers  and partners 
we believe that the growth in the c commerce market will be dramatic and intend to position ourselves as a leader in that market 
we also believe that interoperability the ability for unlike software packages to exchange information with each other and supply chain planning will be crucial for success in the c commerce market 
during fiscal  we significantly improved our c commerce product suite by incorporating interoperability technologies  and by enhancing and integrating our oneworld advanced planning module formerly numetrix s technology 
we believe we have enhanced our market position by launching a major branding campaign around the concept of c commerce and open systems technologies 
however  there can be no assurance that we will become a leader in the c commerce marketplace or that this emerging market will experience substantial growth 
we have actively addressed our future operating plans and are taking the necessary steps  including our restructuring plan  to remain competitive in the future and to continue building a leadership position in the c commerce market 
based on current projections for fiscal  we expect growth in license fee revenue and total revenue  as well as an improvement in operating margins 
however  the uncertainty in the traditional enterprise applications market  challenges of emerging new markets  potential slowdown in global economic conditions  and strong competitive forces could reduce or eliminate our growth in revenue and improvements in operating margins 
these uncertainties have made forward looking projections of future revenue and operating results particularly challenging 
there can be no assurance of the level of revenue growth that will be achieved  if any  or of a return to net profitability or that our financial condition  results of operations  and market price of our common stock will not continue to be adversely affected by the aforementioned factors

we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide related services  including consulting  support  and education 
we recognized revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids tpa issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  in december sab no 
 as amended  provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
in june  the sec issued sab no 
b  delaying the implementation of sab no 
until our fourth quarter of fiscal we have evaluated the impact of sab no 
and believe that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or current licensing or revenue recognition practices 
consulting and education services are not essential to the functionality of our software products  are separately priced  and are available from a number of suppliers 
revenue from these services is recorded separately from the license fee 
we recognize license fee revenue when a non cancelable  contingency free license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  fees from the arrangement are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
revenue on all software license transactions in which there are undelivered elements other than post contract customer support is deferred and recognized once such elements are delivered 
typically  our software licenses do not include significant post delivery obligations to be fulfilled by us  and payments are due within a month period from the date of delivery 
where software license contracts call for payment terms in excess of months from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
revenue from consulting and education services is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from agreements for supporting and providing periodic unspecified upgrades to the licensed software is recorded as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably over the support service period 
such unearned revenue includes a portion of the related arrangement fee equal to the fair value of any bundled support services 
we do not require collateral for receivables and reserves are maintained for potential losses 
we seek to provide our customers with high quality implementation and education services in the most efficient and effective manner 
in some cases where we do not provide the services directly  we subcontract such work through third party implementation support partners 
in addition  we have consulting alliance partnerships with leading consulting companies to provide customers with both technology and application implementation support  offering expertise in business process reengineering and knowledge in diversified industries 
these business partners contract directly with customers for the implementation of our software  and we recognize revenue from a referral fee received from the business partner and incur no related cost of services 
in fiscal  our total revenue exceeded billion compared to million in total revenue for fiscal  a increase and the highest annual revenue achieved in our history 
this was driven by license fee revenue growth of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the revenue mix between license fees and services was and  respectively  for fiscal compared to and  respectively  for fiscal the significant change in revenue mix was primarily due to less demand for software implementations and education following the reduced licensing activity in fiscal  continuing through the transition to the year additionally  higher license fee growth during fiscal  fewer revenue generating consulting employees and our recognition of less direct consulting revenue and less subcontract consulting revenue generated through third parties significantly contributed to the change 
the growth in license fees revenue for fiscal was driven in part by our ability to offer a broad and integrated supply chain planning solution 
a substantial portion of our total revenue is derived from international sales and is therefore subject to the related risks  including general economic conditions in each country  the strength of international competitors  overlap of different tax structures  difficulty of managing an organization spread over various countries  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  longer payment cycles  and volatilities of exchange rates in certain countries 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar adversely affected our total revenue during fiscal  primarily as a result of the weakening of the euro exchange rates against the us dollar 
based on foreign exchange rates in effect at the beginning of our fiscal year compared to actual rates  total revenue would have been million higher than the reported billion  or an increase over the prior year compared to the reported increase 
foreign exchange rates could continue to adversely affect our total revenue throughout fiscal if the us dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies 
generally  operating margins are higher on domestic revenue than on international revenue 
additionally  operating margins are usually higher in the geographic areas where our operations are more established than in the geographic areas we entered more recently 
international revenue as a percentage of total revenue ranged between and for each of the past three fiscal years 
geographically  the overall revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal was led by sales performance in the us the geographic areas defined as the us  europe  the middle east  and africa emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively  for fiscal for fiscal  the us  emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively 
license fees 
license fee revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the overall average license fee transaction size in fiscal  with over transactions exceeding million compared to transactions exceeding million in fiscal approximately of our total license fee revenue was generated from the transactions exceeding million during fiscal the percentage of revenue from new customers was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the mix of revenue from new and existing customers varies from year to year  and future growth is dependent on our ability to both retain our installed base of customers while adding new customers 
there can be no assurance that our license fee growth  results of operations  and financial condition will not be adversely affected in future periods as a result of downturns in global economic conditions or intensified competitive pressures  or that our operational investments for the long term will be successful 
we increased our number of customers by during fiscal to over  at october  our revenue mix has continued to shift toward our oneworld applications available for the windows nt and unix platforms 
during fiscal  of license activity was due to customers using the windows nt or unix platforms compared to in fiscal we expect that an increasing portion of our future license fee revenue will be generated from customers using windows nt or unix platforms 
however  there can be no assurance that we will generate increasing amounts of revenue from nt and unix platforms 
services 
services revenue includes fees generated by personnel providing direct services to customers  including consulting  support  and education  and fees generated through third parties for subcontracted services as well as referral fees from service providers who contract directly with customers 
services revenue declined by to million for fiscal from million for the year ended october  this decrease was primarily a result of less demand for software implementations and education following the reduced licensing activity in fiscal  continuing through the first half of our fiscal year due to customers concerns regarding potential year systems issues 
additionally  our recognition of less direct consulting revenue and less subcontract consulting revenue generated through third parties significantly contributed to the change 
beginning in fiscal  we initiated a strategy of referring customers to service providers who contract directly with our customers for the implementation of oneworld 
during fiscal  our referral revenue increased from fiscal and resulted in the recognition of less direct consulting revenue and subcontract consulting revenue generated through third parties 
the subcontracted consulting and education revenue decreased in fiscal compared to last year 
direct services decreased in fiscal from fiscal the services revenue generated through subcontracted work accounted for of the total consulting and education services revenue for fiscal  compared to for fiscal additionally  compared to fiscal  we had fewer revenue generating consulting employees  which contributed to the decrease in direct services revenue 
in fiscal  we intend to improve utilization of our existing consulting staff and increase the number of direct revenue generating consulting employees due to expected demand for services and our intention to increase the number of direct service engagements 
we also intend to continue to pursue business partner relationships under both subcontract and referral arrangements  as appropriate  to best meet our objectives and our customers needs 
customer support revenue increased in fiscal  which somewhat offset the decline in consulting and education services  due to our growing installed base of customers and consistent maintenance renewal rates compared to fiscal in fiscal  customer support revenue is expected to rise due to an overall increase in pricing for maintenance together with the strong license revenue growth in fiscal additionally  we are offering certain new premium levels of support to our new and existing customers at a higher price 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will maintain consistent maintenance renewal rates in the future due to the increase in prices or the level of maintenance revenue growth  if any  that will result from the premium level of customer support being offered 
as a percentage of total revenue  services revenue decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal this decline in the services mix was due to growth in license fee revenue coupled with the decreases in consulting services and decline in education revenue during fiscal in any fiscal year  total services revenue is dependent on license transactions closed during the current and preceding years  the growth in our installed base of customers  the amount and size of consulting engagements  the level of competition from alliance partners for consulting and implementation work  the number of company and service provider consultants available to staff engagements  the number of customers referred to alliance partners for consulting and education services  the number of customers who have contracted for support and the amount of the related fees  billing rates for consulting services and education courses  and the number of customers purchasing education services 
cost of license fees 
cost of license fees includes business partner commissions  royalties  amortization of internally developed capitalized software including payments to third parties related to internal projects and contractual payments to third parties for embedded products  documentation  and software delivery expenses 
the total dollar amount for the cost of license fees increased to million for the fiscal year from million for fiscal the increase for fiscal was primarily due to reseller royalties on siebel and ariba software transactions  in addition to royalties for certain embedded products 
capitalized oneworld costs were fully amortized early in fiscal amortization of capitalized oneworld costs was million for fiscal and million for fiscal we capitalized additional software development costs in the amount of million for fiscal these costs related to investments in third party products that have been or will be embedded into oneworld and provide new functionality 
additionally  we capitalized payments for outsourced development and internal costs for major product enhancements 
amortization of a significant portion of these capitalized costs is expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal and will continue over the estimated useful lives of the products  which are generally three years 
additional costs for these and other development projects are expected to be capitalized in future periods given the current product development plans 
gross margin on license fee revenue varies from year to year depending on the revenue volume in relation to certain fixed costs  such as the amortization of capitalized software development costs and the portion of our software products that are subject to royalty payments 
the gross margin for fiscal was significantly impacted primarily by the increase in reseller royalty expense from siebel and ariba software transactions 
the fiscal gross margin on license fee revenue decreased to from for fiscal as a result of these reseller royalties 
due to the reseller royalties and capitalized software amortization  total cost of license fees are expected to increase in the future 
as a result  gross margins on license fee revenue are expected to decline compared to prior years 
cost of services 
cost of services includes the personnel and related overhead costs for providing services to customers  including consulting  implementation  support  and education  as well as fees paid to third parties for subcontracted services 
cost of services decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a smaller portion of services revenue generated through subcontracted work  which decreased the related third party subcontract costs 
the gross margin on services revenue increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal primarily due to a change in the mix of total services revenue 
customer support revenue  which has a higher margin than consulting and education  increased as a percentage of total services revenue 
gross margins on services revenue for fiscal depend on the mix of total services revenue  the impact of our maintenance price increase  the extent to which we are successful in increasing the number of revenue generating consulting employees and the number of direct service engagements  improving utilization of our existing consulting staff  and the extent to which we utilize our service partner relationships under either subcontract or referral arrangements 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists of personnel  commissions  and related overhead costs for the sales and marketing activities  together with advertising and promotion costs 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase is primarily a result of commissions associated with the growth in software license fee revenue  higher advertising and promotion expenditures  and increased salaries due to the competitive market for personnel in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for support and administrative functions 
general and administrative expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the total dollar amount of expense was slightly higher in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in salaries  contract professional services  and certain other costs 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained essentially flat primarily due to increased efficiencies within support functions to manage the overall growth in our operations 
research and development 
research and development r d expense includes personnel and related overhead costs for product development  enhancements  upgrades  testing  quality assurance  documentation  and translation  net of any capitalized costs 
r d expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in headcount and higher salaries due to the competitive market for personnel  together with increases in related facilities and computer systems necessary to meet product development objectives  offset by costs capitalized during fiscal including capitalized development expenditures  research and development expenditures were million for fiscal  or of total revenue 
during fiscal  we devoted development resources primarily to major enhancements and new products associated with our oneworld application suites  such as the september release of oneworld xe  as well as the integration of our internally developed applications with acquired applications and those of third parties 
we also completed certain significant enhancements to our worldsoftware functionality  including advanced planning capabilities and web enablement 
in addition to our internal r d activities  we outsourced the development of software for a specialized industry  and we acquired source code rights for certain enterprise interface applications and other embedded technology 
we capitalize internally developed software costs and software purchased from third parties in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
during fiscal  we capitalized million associated with internal costs and million of third party contractual obligations and outsourced development 
we anticipate that costs of certain development projects will continue to be capitalized in the future and that total development expenses will increase in subsequent periods due to the addition of personnel and increasing salaries resulting from competitive market pressures 
we are continuing ongoing internal product enhancements in e business and other areas  as well as integration of such modules as sales force automation  advanced planning and scheduling  and e procurement 
certain of these projects utilize third party development alliances  such as siebel  ariba  webmethods  netfish  and extensity 
amortization of acquired software and other intangibles 
total amortization for fiscal resulting from our three business acquisitions related to software  in place workforce  customer base  and goodwill was million  million  million  and million  respectively 
in fiscal  total amortization was million  million  million  and million  related to software  in place workforce  customer base  and goodwill  respectively 
acquired in process research and development 
ipr d expenses were in connection with the acquisitions of numetrix in june and the premisys corporation in february ipr d represents the value of acquired products that are not yet proven to be technologically feasible but have been developed to a point where there is value associated with them in relation to potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned values were expensed immediately upon the closing dates of the acquisitions 
aggregate ipr d expenses recorded during fiscal were million 
no such charges were incurred with respect to the fiscal acquisition of jde nz 
the most significant in process technology acquired was in development by numetrix prior to the fiscal acquisition to provide an operational level planning and scheduling optimization solution targeted at discrete manufacturing industries 
additionally  prior to the fiscal acquisition  a new demand planning module was in the process of design by numetrix to enhance enterprise wide collaborative forecasting and address forecast reconciliation 
both technologies were released in october another in process technology of numetrix  a collaborative enabler  is designed to efficiently interface the messaging architecture among applications to allow real time  alert driven collaboration 
this technology is now part of jd edwards advanced planning integration project 
in process technology acquired in our purchase of the premisys corporation is now functionally integrated with oneworld and was released in august see fiscal years ended october  and  for further details 
restructuring and related charges 
during fiscal  the board of directors approved a global restructuring plan to reduce our operating expenses and strengthen both our competitive and financial positions 
overall expense reductions were necessary both to lower our existing cost structure and to reallocate resources to pursue our future operating strategies 
the restructuring plan was precipitated by declining gross margins and other performance measures such as revenue per employee over the past several fiscal quarters  as our headcount and operating expenses grew at a faster rate than revenue 
as discussed in prior periods  we also had incurred operating losses in certain geographic areas 
we effected the restructuring plan during the third quarter of fiscal by eliminating certain employee positions  reducing office space and related overhead expenses  and modifying our approach for providing certain services to our customers 
restructuring and related charges primarily consist of severance related costs for the involuntarily terminated employees  operating lease termination payments  and office closure costs 
the majority of the restructuring activity occurred during the second half of fiscal  and we expect that remaining actions  such as office closures or consolidations and lease terminations  will be completed within a one year time frame 
severance related costs include the termination payments  benefits  outplacement  and other related costs paid to the employees terminated worldwide 
the total workforce reduction was effected through a combination of involuntary terminations and reorganizing operations to permanently eliminate open positions resulting from normal employee attrition 
only costs for involuntarily terminated employees are included in the restructuring charge 
specifically targeted were areas with opportunities for more efficient processes that would reduce staffing  where operations were generating losses  or where redundancy existed 
we decreased our workforce by a total of employees across most geographic areas and functions of our business  including administrative  professional  and management positions 
all employee terminations occurred during the third quarter of fiscal  although a limited number of involuntarily terminated employees continued to provide transitional services generally to days from their termination date 
salary and benefits earned during the transition period were not included in the restructuring charge and severance packages were only provided to the involuntarily terminated employees 
in addition to the decrease in employee positions  the restructuring plan provided for reduction in office space and related overhead expenses 
office and training facility closure and consolidation costs are the estimated costs to close specifically identified facilities  costs associated with obtaining subleases  lease termination costs  and other related costs  all of which are in accordance with the restructuring plan 
we closed or consolidated several facilities worldwide  including offices in denver  colorado and regional offices in the us  europe  and the asia pacific region 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the majority of denver based personnel were consolidated into the main corporate headquarters campus  with the remaining moves expected to be completed by february other significant reductions  such as those that occurred in japan and certain european countries  were substantially completed during fiscal we also closed or downsized several under utilized training facilities as a result of our modified training approach 
certain regional facilities  including denver  colorado  chicago  illinois  dallas  texas  secaucus  new jersey  rutherford  new jersey  and toronto  canada were closed  downsized  or significantly reduced 
these closures and reductions were completed in december the charge for operating lease buyouts and related costs represent the actual or estimated costs associated with the early termination of leases for computer equipment  phones  and automobiles that were no longer necessary for operations due to our reduced workforce and facilities 
during fiscal  we wrote off certain assets  consisting primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment  and furniture and fixtures that were deemed unnecessary due to the reduction in workforce 
these assets were taken out of service and disposed of during fiscal we recorded adjustments to reduce the restructuring provision by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal a portion of the adjustment relates to favorable negotiations with a vendor through which we successfully reduced a contractual termination fee by million 
we also successfully negotiated higher sublease income associated with leased office space and subleased some vacated premises more quickly than anticipated for a total of million 
additionally  net employee outplacement  severance  and termination costs were increased by  for other additional costs not anticipated in the original restructuring plan 
we expect these organizational changes to result in annual savings across all functional areas of approximately million to million  allowing us to reallocate resources to further invest in areas critical to our future success 
we believe that the restructuring plan and resource reallocation will better allow us to continue building our leadership position in the c commerce market 
there can be no assurance of our future level of operating expenses or of other factors that may impact future operating results 
other income expense 
other income and expenses include interest and dividend income earned on cash  cash equivalents  investments  interest expense  foreign currency gains and losses  and other non operating income and expenses 
during fiscal  other income included an million gain on the sale of an equity security and a million gain from the sale of a product line 
interest and dividend income decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to lower cash and investment balances throughout much of fiscal included in other income and expense were net foreign exchange transaction losses of  for fiscal and a loss of  last fiscal year 
the losses related primarily to the overall strengthening of the us dollar against european currencies 
we use hedging instruments to help offset the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
the hedging instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of generally three months or less 
all contracts are entered into with major financial institutions 
gains and losses on these contracts are included with foreign currency gains and losses on the transactions being hedged and are recognized as non operating income or expense in the period in which the gain or loss on the underlying transaction is recognized 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
hedging activities cannot completely protect us from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which we conduct business  the volatility of currency rates  and the constantly changing currency exposures 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
we held short and long term investments excluding equity securities of certain publicly traded or privately held technology companies that had a fair value at october   of million and a gross unrealized loss of  during fiscal  we realized losses of  from the sales of municipal bonds 
these realized losses are shown in the accompanying statement of operations as a component of other income 
in addition  during fiscal  we made equity investments in certain publicly traded or privately held technology companies of million  and we realized gains of million from the sale of a portion of our investment 
these realized gains are shown in the accompanying statement of operations as a component of other income 
at october   these investments had a fair value of million and a gross unrealized gain of million 
one of the equity securities is subject to a lock up provision  which expires in january additionally  we have a million note receivable from a privately held company related to the sale of a product line 
the note is convertible into equity at our option upon the closing of an initial public offering of their common stock 
we may also invest in other companies in the future 
investments in technology enterprises  and companies with recent initial public offerings in particular  are highly volatile 
our future results of operations could be adversely affected should the values of these investments decline below the amounts invested by us 
as a result of the highly volatile stock market  we cannot give assurance that the unrealized gains related to these investments will be realized or that possible future investments that we may make will be profitable 
other data regarding results of operations 
the impact of acquisition related charges  restructuring and related charges  and significant gains on our net loss and net loss per share in fiscal and fiscal are presented below in thousands  except per share data 
there were no acquisition related charges  restructuring and related charges  or other significant one time gains and losses for fiscal this supplemental information does not reflect our results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us  and it is not intended to be superior to or more meaningful than other information presented herein that was prepared in accordance with gaap

the associated fiscal income tax benefit was million and million  respectively  resulting in the acquisition related charges  net of tax  shown above 
after adjustments  the restructuring charge consisted of a million charge for fiscal  and the related benefit from income tax was million 
other items during fiscal consisted of an million net gain resulting from the sale of a portion of our equity investment in a technology company and a million net gain from the sale of a product line 
for periods in which we report a net loss  common stock equivalents such as stock options are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share 
the effect of including common stock equivalents would be to decrease the reported losses per share  which is anti dilutive and not acceptable under gaap 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this change was due primarily to differences in tax rates in various countries where the restructuring costs were incurred during fiscal and certain acquisition related charges that reduced the overall income tax benefit for fiscal excluding the effect of the restructuring charges and acquisition related permanent differences  the rate for fiscal and fiscal was 
we have available approximately million in foreign tax credit carryforwards  of which million will expire in  million will expire in  and million will expire in we have a us net operating loss carryforward nol of approximately million  of which million will expire in  million will expire in  and million will expire in additionally  an r d credit carryforward of approximately million is available  of which million will expire in and million will expire in we received a benefit from the tax deductions for compensation in excess of compensation expense recognized for financial reporting purposes 
such credit arises from an increase in the market price of the stock under employee option agreements between the measurement date as defined in accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and the date at which the compensation deduction for income tax purposes is determinable 
additional paid in capital was increased by this tax benefit of million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively  and is included in the accompanying statement of changes in stockholders equity 
we have net deferred tax assets of million at october   which includes a valuation allowance of million related to foreign tax credits 
this valuation allowance was recorded because we could not utilize the foreign tax credits in fiscal and there is sufficient uncertainty as to whether the credits will be utilized prior to expiration 
also included in the deferred tax asset balance at october   are approximately million in tax effected nols 
approximately million of the deferred tax asset related to nols was generated due to the benefit of dispositions from employee stock plans  which were recorded directly to stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the nols is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income to utilize the nols prior to their expiration 
the minimum amount of taxable income required to realize this asset is million 
we believe that based on available evidence  both positive and negative  it is more likely than not that currently recorded deferred tax assets will be fully realized based on analysis of historical results  projections of future operating results  including the future benefits of the current year restructuring and improved operating margins  expected dispositions from employee stock plans  and an assessment of the market conditions that have and are expected to affect us in the future 
the carryforward periods on the nols and tax credit carryforwards were also considered 
fiscal years ended october  and total revenue 
total revenue increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the revenue mix between license fees and services was and  respectively  for fiscal compared to and  respectively  for fiscal the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was from growth in services revenue while license fee revenue declined  resulting in a significant change in revenue mix 
we believe the slowed growth was primarily due to companies purchasing enterprise resource planning erp systems prior to in anticipation of potential systems issues associated with the year during fiscal  we experienced sequential declines in quarterly license fee revenue in the first and second quarters 
however  sequential quarterly growth in license fees again was realized in the third and fourth quarters 
the growth in services revenue  which typically trails license fee revenue  also was impacted  slowing from growth in fiscal to in fiscal geographically  the revenue mix shifted moderately toward international for fiscal compared to fiscal the geographic areas defined as the us  emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively  for fiscal comparatively  for fiscal  the us  emea  and the rest of the world accounted for   and of total revenue  respectively 
we believe this geographic shift in revenue may have been caused by companies in the us preparing earlier and more aggressively for the year as compared with companies in other parts of the world 
license fees 
license fee revenue decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to fewer transactions and a decline in the average transaction size as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average transaction size was experienced with both new and existing customers and was due to a number of factors  including a larger portion of licenses for the windows nt platform  which typically includes fewer users than licenses for the unix or iseries formerly as r platforms 
the percentage of license activity from new customers declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal however  we expanded the number of customers by compared to the end of fiscal to over  at october  customers increasingly accepted the oneworld applications available for windows nt and unix platforms 
as an indication of oneworld s growing acceptance on non iseries platforms  of license activity was from customers using the windows nt or unix platforms in fiscal compared to in fiscal the remaining portion of license activity was generated by customers using either worldsoftware or oneworld for the iseries 
services 
services revenue grew to million for fiscal from million for the year ended october  this increase was due to higher revenue from consulting  the largest component of services  and higher maintenance revenue 
the increase in consulting revenue was primarily due to fiscal license fee revenue  which resulted in demand for implementation services 
maintenance revenue increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of our growing installed base of customers and consistent maintenance renewal rates for existing customers 
education services revenue  which typically trails the fluctuations in license fee revenue  decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in license fee revenue 
as a percentage of total revenue  services revenue increased during fiscal compared to fiscal this was primarily due to the timing of services revenue in relation to license fee growth in prior periods 
the subcontracted consulting and education services revenue from service providers increased for fiscal over fiscal  while direct services increased in fiscal over fiscal the services revenue generated through subcontracted work accounted for for fiscal of our consulting and education services revenue compared to for fiscal cost of license fees 
the total dollar amount for the cost of license fees decreased to million for the year ended october   from million in fiscal primarily due to lower license revenue and resulting decreases in royalty expenses and service provider commissions 
amortization of internally developed capitalized software costs decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as certain software development costs were fully amortized during fiscal gross margin on license fee revenue varies from year to year depending on the revenue volume in relation to certain fixed costs  such as the amortization of internally developed capitalized software development costs  and the portion of software products that are subject to royalty payments and the amounts negotiated for such royalties 
the gross margin on license fee revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to lower royalty expenses and service provider commissions 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to subcontracted service provider costs and increased personnel expenses to support the implementation and consulting services demand  as well as an increase in the number of customer support staff 
during fiscal  a larger percentage of consulting and education services revenue was generated through subcontracted work  which increased the related costs compared to the gross margin on services revenue dropped to for fiscal compared to for fiscal due to the slowing in license fee growth  the utilization rates for our consulting organization declined in fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in expense in fiscal was primarily the result of additional personnel and increased advertising and promotion costs for our expanded marketing activities 
the total number of sales and marketing personnel increased as of october   compared to october   primarily the result of adding personnel in direct sales and support positions through the first quarter of fiscal to meet our future sales goals  support the new vertical industry sales force alignment  and address the windows nt and unix market growth opportunities from the oneworld version of application suites 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended october   from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the total dollar amount of expense increased primarily due to an increase in general and administrative personnel to support the larger number of total employees in fiscal year compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased primarily due to the lower than expected license fee revenue in fiscal research and development 
r d expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to a increase in the number of personnel compared to fiscal this increase in personnel included approximately employees from the acquisitions of numetrix and the premisys corporation 
development resources primarily were devoted to enhancements of both worldsoftware and oneworld application suites during both fiscal and we ceased capitalizing oneworld development costs during fiscal  and there were no internal software development costs capitalized during fiscal or amortization of acquired software and other intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles was related to the acquisitions of numetrix in june and the premisys corporation in february acquired intangible assets consist of core software  in place workforce  customer base  and goodwill 
amortization expense for the fiscal year ended october   related to the software  in place workforce  customer base  and goodwill was million  million  million  and million  respectively 
in process research and development 
ipr d expenses were in connection with the acquisitions of numetrix and the premisys corporation 
ipr d consists of those products that are not yet proven to be technologically feasible but have been developed to a point where there is value associated with them in relation to potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses are believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned values were expensed immediately upon the closing dates of the acquisitions 
aggregate ipr d expenses were million for fiscal no such charges were incurred in fiscal the numetrix acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and we retained an independent appraiser to assist with assigning fair values to the intangible assets 
specifically identified intangible assets included developed technology  in process technology  in place workforce  and the existing customer base 
the valuations relied on methodologies that most closely related the fair market value assignment with the economic benefits provided by each asset and the risks associated with the assets 
in valuing both the developed and in process technology  an income based approach was determined to best quantify the economic benefits and risks 
the economic benefits were quantified using projections of net cash flows and the risks by applying an appropriate discount rate 
as of the acquisition date  numetrix had completed a substantial amount of r d on a new discrete scheduling product that represented a strategic product designed to address the market for discrete factory planning for middle market companies 
also underway was the development of a new demand planning module and a new collaborative enabler 
numetrix also was developing major revisions and enhancements of almost all of the modules of its product suite as of the date of acquisition 
following is a description of the specific nature of each of the new in process development projects acquired the most significant in process technology was being designed to offer an operational level  discrete planning and scheduling solution targeted at the middle market 
at the time  numetrix s solution in the market relied on process scheduling rather than discrete scheduling  and a large technical difference exists between the two types of scheduling 
process scheduling is used by manufacturers in such industries as paper products and processed foods  with significant capital investment in the machinery compared to the investment in raw material products 
these types of industries require production and scheduling systems to coordinate with the interruptible nature of the manufacturing process 
in comparison  discrete scheduling is utilized in industries with non interruptible processes with emphasis on the product materials rather than the machinery  such as computer component manufacturing 
the two types of scheduling employ different data models  and users in each case require different operating parameters from production scheduling solutions 
as of the valuation date  the beta release was scheduled for september  and development was estimated to be nearly complete 
a new demand planning module was being designed to enhance enterprise wide collaborative forecasting and address forecast reconciliation 
this application was intended to be marketed as a component of both the numetrix product suite and the new discrete product 
new features of this product included a full forecasting graphical interface that allows for manipulation of variables and inputs to optimize demand planning 
as of the valuation date  numetrix was analyzing requirements for the product and had not begun to write code 
the first scheduled release was planned for the middle of calendar as of the acquisition date  the module was less than complete 
another in process technology  a collaborative enabler  was designed to efficiently interface the messaging architecture among applications to allow real time  alert driven collaboration 
the product automatically detects changes to data in other applications and instantaneously processes the impact of the changes among applications 
designed to integrate into the numetrix product suite solution  it offered a more cost effective solution for messaging optimization as compared to the current technology 
the initial product release was scheduled for the middle of calendar  and as of the acquisition date the technology was estimated to be complete 
both the developed technology and in process development valuations were based primarily on an income approach that examined all projected revenue and expenses attributable to the assets over the economic life of each 
a variation of the income approach that applies a percentage of completion calculation was also used to value in process technology  and this method was used for recording the fair value of in process development 
in this approach  the r d costs to complete the in process technology are not deducted as an expense 
however  the net cash flows are multiplied by the percentage of completion of the technology 
the percentage of completion was based on the development expense spent as of the valuation date as a percentage of the total required development expense for each new product and each new release of the existing products 
the basis of the financial projections used in the valuation analysis was management projections of the revenue and expenses likely to be realized by numetrix 
projected revenue was split between developed  in process  and future technology to be developed subsequent to the valuation date 
the classification of each r d project as complete or under development was made in accordance with the guidelines of sfas no 
 sfas no 
 and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
all expenses associated with those revenues were deducted  including cost of goods sold  sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and r d expenses 
allocations of revenue and expenses between developed  in process  and future technology were based on the development schedule of new products and new versions of existing products and the estimated lines of code needed to complete each in process product phase as provided by numetrix 
unless otherwise appropriate  these expenses were allocated to developed  in process  and future technology in the same ratio as the revenue 
an economic rent for use of other assets was deducted  including the in place workforce  working capital  fixed assets  trademarks  and customer base 
a royalty rate for the proprietary distributed object messaging architecture was deducted where appropriate for applications relying on this existing technology 
income taxes were deducted at the estimated effective tax rate 
an appropriate discount rate was applied to the projects to calculate the net present value of the developed and in process technology over their economic lives 
the valuations used a discounted cash flow analysis of financial projections over the estimated useful lives of the existing technology 
after the end of the projection period  no further revenue was assumed  and no residual value of the technologies was used 
the projected revenue stream by product developed  in process  and future was determined by the existing lines of software code and incremental lines of code for future releases of each product 
the discount rate was based on the weighted average cost of capital method and was determined to be for numetrix 
this same rate was used for valuing the ipr d due to the level of risk  which was considered the same as that for the company as a whole 
a discount rate of was used for developed technology due to the lower level of risk 
financial projections used to value the intangibles included breakdowns of revenue from license fees  implementation and consulting services  and maintenance  along with costs of the revenue components  major operating expense categories  and income taxes for fiscal through numetrix s fiscal year ending february  based on historical data provided by the management of numetrix regarding the rate at which the code base for developed technology would become obsolete  the expected replacement and augmentation of existing software code for each product  as well as the rate at which replacement technology would be developed  the projection period was deemed appropriate 
significant changes were not anticipated from historical pricing or gross margins 
management anticipates solid revenue growth consistent with historical and projected results of competitors as well as general market expectations for the supply chain management space and especially web enabled applications  such as those currently and expected to be offered by numetrix 
also  the discrete scheduling product under development targeted the much larger market of mid size manufacturing companies in addition to our traditional market of fortune customers 
operating expenses are also expected to increase significantly but  as a percentage of revenue  are projected to fall closer in line with industry averages consistent with the major erp providers  including jd edwards  oracle  and sap 
accordingly  the operating margin is expected to be at a break even point in fiscal and gradually increase through numetrix s fiscal year ending february  the appraisal resulted in a value of million for ipr d and million for developed technology 
the premisys corporation provides visual configuration software and consulting services 
at the date of acquisition  the premisys corporation was developing major enhancements to its customworks product  such as functionality to address setup complexities and quoting 
additionally  the premisys corporation and jd edwards began developing an interface between customworks and oneworld under a product alliances partner agreement entered into by the two companies in august the percentage completion variation of the income approach also was used to value the ipr d from the premisys corporation acquisition based on projected revenue and expenses likely to be realized 
however  both a replacement cost approach and market approach were considered and provided further support for the valuation 
the percentage of completion for the in process technology was based on the development expense spent as of the valuation date as a percentage of the total required development expense 
the financial projections include revenue from license fees  implementation and consulting services  and maintenance  along with costs of the revenue components  major operating expense categories  and income taxes for fiscal through fiscal charges for other assets also were deducted  including a royalty for the core technology  fixed assets  working capital  and other intangibles 
income taxes were deducted at the estimated effective tax rate for the company 
a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for the level of risk associated with the development projects 
this rate was used over the economic life to calculate the net present value of million for the developed technology and million for the in process technology 
the assumptions in the valuation reflect management s anticipation of solid revenue growth consistent with the historical and projected results of competitors  as well as general market expectations for the supply chain management space and front office applications  such as customworks 
operating expense assumptions showed significant increases  gradually falling in line with industry averages consistent with the major erp providers  including jd edwards  oracle  and sap 
accordingly  the operating margin in the financial model was expected to grow over two years  but then gradually decline as the developed and in process products mature 
other income expense 
other income and expense includes interest and dividend income earned on cash  cash equivalents  investments  interest expense  foreign currency gains and losses  and other non operating income and expenses 
interest income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher yields on invested funds 
other income also increased due to proceeds from a legal judgment received during the second quarter of fiscal during late fiscal  we broadened our foreign exchange hedging activities to help offset the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
net of hedging activities  foreign currency losses decreased to  for fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an improved hedging program 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this change was due primarily to differences between financial accounting and tax treatment of certain acquisition related charges that reduced the overall income tax benefit for fiscal excluding the effect of the acquisition related permanent differences  the rate for fiscal was 
quarterly results of operations supplementary financial information the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of income data  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue except for gross margin data  for each of our last eight quarters 
this data has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information 
these unaudited quarterly results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k

as a result  quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
furthermore  we believe that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to our business or generally  it is likely that the market price of our common stock would be materially adversely affected 
see factors affecting the company s business  operating results  and financial condition our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations and a failure to meet expectations could adversely impact the price of our stock 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short and long term investments  and a million unsecured  revolving line of credit that can be utilized for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of october   we had working capital of million  and no amounts were outstanding under our bank line of credit 
short term deferred revenue and customer deposits totaling million are included in determining this amount 
the short term deferred revenue primarily represents annual maintenance payments billed to customers and recognized ratably as revenue over the support service period 
without the short term deferred revenue and customer deposits  working capital would have been million  including long term investments  working capital would have been million 
during fiscal  we liquidated a portion of our portfolio of marketable securities prior to their maturity dates in order to settle certain equity contracts 
as a result  our entire held to maturity portfolio was reclassified to available for sale as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  at october   all investments were carried at fair value as determined by their quoted marketprices and included as appropriate in either short or long term investments 
all unrealized gains or losses were included  net of tax  in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at october   all investments were classified as held to maturity and were carried at amortized cost  accordingly 
we calculate accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso on a gross basis by dividing the accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by days 
the impact of deferred revenue is not included in the computation 
calculated as such  dso was days as of october   compared to days as of the previous fiscal year end 
our dso can fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including the concentration of transactions that occur toward the end of each quarter and the variability of quarterly operating results 
see factors affecting the company s business  operating results  and financial condition our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations and a failure to meet expectations could adversely impact the price of our stock 
we generated cash flow from our operations of million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in operating cash flow between fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to restructuring related liabilities and contractual obligations to third parties for products and source code rights  offset somewhat by a reduction in the net loss in fiscal resulting from increased license fee revenue and gains on sales of equity investments and a product line 
the decrease in operating cash flow between fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to the fiscal net loss before acquired ipr d and cash payments for accrued liabilities  which was offset somewhat by collections of accounts receivable 
we generated million of cash from investing and financing activities for fiscal compared to using million for fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from the prior years was primarily the result of the liquidation and sale of a portion of our portfolio of marketable securities and a portion of the common stock of a publicly traded technology company 
the proceeds were primarily used to fund the million repurchase of million shares of our common stock as a result of the settlement of equity repurchase contracts  to invest in million of capitalized software development  and to acquire jde nz for million during fiscal in fiscal  net cash payments totaled million for the numetrix and the premisys corporation acquisitions 
during fiscal  the primary investing activity was the purchase of short and long term debt and equity securities with cash from the initial public offering 
during each of these fiscal years  proceeds from the issuance of common stock under common stock options and the employee stock purchase plan espp provided additional funding 
during each of these fiscal years  we purchased property and equipment that was necessary to support operations 
we have a stock repurchase plan which was designed to partially offset the effects of share issuances under our stock option plans and espp 
the board of directors authorized the repurchase up to million shares of our common stock under this plan 
during fiscal  we entered into equity derivative contracts for the purchase of million common shares in accordance with the share repurchase plan  and we settled contracts for the repurchase of million shares for a total of million in cash 
approximately  of the repurchased shares were reissued to fund the june  espp purchase 
as of october   approximately million remaining shares were held as treasury stock to fund future stock issuances 
the treasury shares are recorded at cost and reissuances are accounted for by a first in  first out method 
at october   we held forward contracts requiring the purchase at a future date of million shares of common stock at an average cost of per share 
forward purchase contracts require a full physical settlement and the aggregate redemption cost of million is included in the accompanying balance sheet in temporary equity with a corresponding decrease in additional paid in capital 
the equity instruments are exercisable only at their dates of expiration 
at october  the dates of expiration ranged from december to september in december  the company rolled forward  shares expiring in december to december  resulting in a new expiration range of march to december the counter party to the contracts has the right to require an early settlement based on the market price of jd edwards common stock as stipulated in the contracts 
additionally  a decline in our common stock price below the stipulated price in the contracts may trigger the requirement to collateralize the outstanding exposure 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on several factors  including the level of stock issuances under the stock plans  the price of our stock  general market conditions  and other factors 
stock repurchases may be effected from time to time at our discretion through forward  put and call transactions  or open market purchases 
see factors affecting the company s business  operating results  and financial condition a decline in the price of our common stock beyond certain levels as stipulated in the equity forward contracts may require an acceleration of cash requirements 
we lease our corporate headquarters office buildings that were constructed on land we own 
the lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of a bank  and a syndication of banks collectively financed million in purchase and construction costs through a combination of debt and equity 
we guarantee the residual value of each building up to approximately of its original cost 
our lease obligations are based on a return on the lessor s costs 
we have elected to reduce the interest rate used to calculate lease expense by collateralizing up to of the financing arrangements with investments consistent with our investment policy 
we may withdraw the funds used as collateral at our sole discretion provided it is not in default under the lease agreement 
investments designated as collateral  including a required coverage margin  are held in separate investment accounts 
at october  and  investments totaling million and million were designated as collateral for these leases  respectively 
the lease agreement requires that we remain in compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants and representations and warranties  including certain defined financial covenants 
at october  and  we were in compliance with the covenants 
we believe the cash and cash equivalents balance  short and long term investments  funds generated from operations  and amounts available under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet cash needs for at least the next months 
we may use a portion of short and long term investments to make strategic investments in other companies  acquire businesses  products  or technologies that are complementary to our business  or settle equity contracts to acquire common stock in the future 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional funds to support working capital requirements or for other purposes  in which case we may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us and would not result in additional dilution to our stockholders

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of operations  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory  or credit risks  are not included in the following assessment of our market risks 
foreign currency exchange rates 
operations outside the us expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes and could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
the exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the us primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  africa  asia pacific  canada  and latin america 
these foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or  more recently  the euro as their functional currency because revenue is generated and expenses are incurred in such currencies 
a substantial portion of our total revenue is derived from international sales and is therefore subject to the related risks  including general economic conditions in each country  overlap of different tax structures  difficulty of managing an organization spread over various countries  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  longer payment cycles  and volatilities of exchange rates in certain countries 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
during fiscal  of our total revenue was generated from international operations  and the net assets of our foreign operations totaled of consolidated net assets as of october  changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar adversely affected our total revenue during fiscal  primarily as a result of the weakening of the euro exchange rates against the us dollar 
based on foreign exchange rates in effect at the beginning of our fiscal year compared to actual rates  total revenue would have been million higher than the reported billion  or an increase over fiscal compared to the reported increase 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exposure of currency revaluation in operating results 
foreign exchange rates could continue to adversely affect our total revenue and results of operations throughout fiscal if the us dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies 
in addition to the above  we have balance sheet exposure related to foreign net asset and forward foreign exchange contracts 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate changes on cash exposures from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
such hedging activities cannot completely protect us from the risk of foreign currency losses due to the number of currencies in which we conduct business  the volatility of currency rates  and the constantly changing currency exposures 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will continue to be affected to by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our exposures from foreign net asset and forward foreign exchange contracts as of october   and our exposure from anticipated foreign revenue during fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates 
our analysis assumed a adverse change in foreign currency rates in relation to the us dollar 
based on the results of the forward foreign exchange contract analyses  a adverse change in foreign exchange rates from the october   rates would not result in a material impact to our results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition for the next fiscal year 
interest rates 
our portfolio of investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
investments  including cash equivalents  consist of us government  state  municipal  and corporate debt securities with maturities of up to months  as well as money market mutual funds and corporate equity securities 
we classify all investments in marketable securities as available for sale and these investments were carried at fair value as determined by their quoted market prices 
unrealized gains or losses were included  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  we have lease obligations calculated as a return on the lessor s costs of funding based on the london interbank offered rate and adjusted from time to time to reflect any changes in our leverage ratio 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income and lease obligations or could impact the fair market value of our investments 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our interest rate exposures and our exposure from anticipated investment and borrowing levels for fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of these analyses  a adverse change in interest rates from the october   rates would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of investments and would not materially impact our results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition for the fiscal year ending october
