item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview were outstanding for all periods prior to the combination  effective march  ebitda represents income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change  interest expense  income taxes  depletion  depreciation and amortization and impairment 
management of the company believes that ebitda may provide additional information about the company s ability to meet its future requirements for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
ebitda is a financial measure commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of a company s profitability or liquidity 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  this measure may vary among companies 
the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies 
the combination as defined herein was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control 
accordingly  as of and for the year ended december   the consolidated accounts are presented using the historical costs and results of operations of the affiliated entities as if such entities had always been combined 
accordingly the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of edge petroleum corporation  a texas corporation  old edge  and edge joint venture ii the joint venture 
the joint venture interests not owned by old edge is recorded as minority interest 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of the company s financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
the company s consolidated financial statements and supplementary data and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview the company was organized as a delaware corporation in august in connection with its initial public offering the offering and the related combination of certain entities that held interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties  herein referred to as the combination 
in a series of combination transactions the company issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received in exchange of the ownership interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties 
in march  and contemporaneously with the combination  the company completed the offering of  shares of its common stock generating proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
the company began operations in and until generated exploratory drilling prospects based on d seismic data for sale to other exploration and production companies 
during  as a result of the advent of economic onshore d seismic surveys and the improvement and increased affordability of data interpretation technologies  the company changed its strategy to emphasize exploration based upon the use of d seismic data 
from to  the company reduced its inventory of d based prospects  began limited drilling for its own account and began developing prospects based on d seismic data 
since early  the company has almost exclusively drilled prospects generated from d seismic data  while accelerating its drilling activity and increasing its working interests in new project areas primarily in south texas and louisiana 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
investments in unproved properties are not subject to amortization until the proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impaired 
to the extent that capitalized costs subject to amortization in the full cost pool net of depletion  depreciation and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  an impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties is assessed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with the company s quarterly filings with the commission 
during the years ended december  and no full cost ceiling test write down was necessary 
at december  the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of approximately million 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  the company has entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps and collars for a portion of its oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to the company of increases in the price of oil and natural gas it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the company s hedging arrangements typically apply to only a portion of its production  providing only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limiting potential gains from future increases in prices 
the company accounts for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedged production occurs 
in december  the company entered into a natural gas collar 
the natural gas collar covers  mmbtus per day for the period january  to december  at a floor and a ceiling 
at december  and  the fair value  gain loss  of outstanding hedges was approximately million and  respectively 
on january   the company closed out the hedge for the period february  to december  at a cost of  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s revenue  profitability and future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
these prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond the company s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
even though oil and natural gas commodity prices have recovered from previously low prices  a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that the company may economically produce 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenue increased from million in to million in for  natural gas production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  oil and condensate comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  and natural gas liquids ngls comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue 
for  natural gas production comprised of total production and of total revenue while oil and condensate production accounted for of total production and of revenue and ngls production comprised of total production and of oil and gas revenue 
the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenue for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease production volumes natural gas mcf    oil and condensate bbls    natural gas liquids bbls    natural gas equivalent mcfe    average sales price natural gas per mcf oil and condensate per bbl natural gas liquids per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe operating revenue natural gas    oil and condensate    natural gas liquids    total    natural gas revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the favorable impact of higher natural gas prices was partially offset by the impact of hedging losses and decreased production 
the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf  exclusive of hedging activity  compared to per mcf for this increase in average price realized resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
included within natural gas revenue for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing losses from hedging activity 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf and per mcf  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   natural gas production decreased from mcfpd in to mcfpd in resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period prices 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate totaled million for the year ended december  including net losses from oil hedge activity of  an increase of from the prior year total of million 
favorable pricing for the year resulted in an increase in revenue of million based on current year production 
the average realized price for oil and condensate for the year ended december  was per barrel  excluding the impact of net oil hedge losses of per barrel  compared to per barrel for the same period in production volumes for oil and condensate decreased to bpd for the year ended december  compared to bpd for the same prior year period 
the decrease in oil and condensate production caused a decrease in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the total of  favorable pricing for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of  based on current year production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in production volumes for ngls for the year ended december  increased  from bpd to bpd  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in ngl production increased revenue by  based on comparable period average prices 
production of oil and natural gas was significantly impacted by the sale of certain oil and natural gas properties effective july  and april  offsetting these declines was the adjustment in june for months of revenue associated with payout on our mcfaddin properties that reached payout in july  but was not determined until june this adjustment resulted in recognition in of  on production of  mcfe 
in addition  we successfully drilled and completed gross net wells in the year ended december  that added additional production and revenue for the current year period 
costs and operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the same period of  an increase of 
current year results were impacted by the recording in june of months of lifting costs totaling approximately  associated with our mcfaddin properties that reached payout in july but was not determined until june in addition  costs increased due to compression charges and salt water disposal costs on certain older properties 
these additional costs more than offset the effect of lower costs resulting from the disposition of proved producing properties effective july   and corporate efforts focused on improving the operation structure in the field 
operating expenses averaged per mcfe for the year ended december  compared to per mcfe for the prior year period 
the increase in operating expenses on a mcfe basis was due to the factors resulting in an overall increase in operating expenses described previously and the sale of certain properties during the third quarter of that had lower overall average operating costs 
severance and ad valorem taxes for taxes for the year ended december  increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher severance taxes paid on the increased revenue  primarily in the fourth quarter of on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes were per mcfe and per mcfe for the year ended december  and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  full cost dd a on our oil and natural gas properties totaled million for compared to million in depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  lower than the rate of per mcfe 
for the year ended december   lower oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in a decrease in depletion expense of  the decrease in the depletion rate was primarily due to year end reserve base additions and revisions 
general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended december   excluding the non cash charge to compensation expense discussed below  totaled million  a decrease from the total of million 
the decrease in costs was due primarily to lower salaries and related benefits attributable to a work force reduction during january for the year ended december  and  g a was reduced by overhead reimbursement fees of approximately  and  respectively 
g a on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe for the comparable period 
a non cash charge to compensation expense of  or per share  was required in in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
fin requires  among other things  a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of edge s common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
the company will adjust deferred compensation expense upward or downward on a monthly basis based on the trading price at the end of each such period as necessary to comply with fin the charge is related to non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and re priced in may of  as well as certain options newly issued in conjunction with the repricing 
unearned compensation expense for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the prior year period 
the amortization of unearned compensation expense is recognized from restricted stock granted to executives at the completion of the offering 
the decrease is due to the resignation of the former president and chief operating officer in december at which time he vested in his remaining restricted stock grant 
the company charged to expense the unamortized unearned compensation associated with his restricted stock upon his resignation  thereby reducing the future amounts to be charged to income 
the other charge during of approximately million primarily represents expenses incurred as a result of the resignation of the company s former president and chief operating officer in as a result of his resignation the company recorded a one time charge of approximately million to satisfy corporate obligations under his employment contract 
included in the million is a million non cash amount relating to the vesting of the remaining balance of the executive s restricted common stock award granted concurrent with company s offering see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the balance of the charge primarily represents an accrual for workforce reduction and cash payments to be paid to the former executive from the date of his resignation to december  other income expense for the year ended december  consisted primarily of a loss on the sale of our investment in frontera of  or per share 
also included in other income expense was interest expense of  for the year ended december  compared to  in the same period 
gross interest expense was  for the year on weighted average debt of million compared to gross interest expense of  on weighted average debt of approximately million for the same prior year period 
included in gross interest expense for the year ended december  was  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with a new credit facility 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  totaled  a decrease of over the prior year amount of  for the same period 
the reduction in capitalized interest resulted from lower exploration activities during the year ended december  compared to the same prior year period 
although gross interest expense has decreased compared to the prior year  the effect of less interest being capitalized to oil and natural gas properties has resulted in higher net interest costs reported in our results of operations 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase in interest income is due to the overall increase in funds invested in overnight money market funds 
due to our significant deferred tax assets  no tax expense was recorded for the year ended december  or due to the uncertainty as to whether we will be profitable in the future  an allowance has been provided to offset the tax benefits of certain tax assets 
should we continue to have net income in future periods  incurred tax expense will be recorded upon utilization of available tax assets 
for the year ended december  the company had net income of million  or basic earnings per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or basic earnings per share  in weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to the private placement of million shares of common stock in may year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenue decreased from million in to million in production volumes for natural gas decreased from  mcf in to  mcf in the decrease in natural gas production reduced revenues by approximately million 
a decrease in average natural gas prices further reduced revenues by approximately  a increase in average oil and condensate prices increased revenue by approximately  for over this was partly offset by the impact of a decrease in oil and condensate production of from  barrels in to  barrels in the decrease in oil production negatively impacted revenue by approximately  ngl production for the year ended december  increased from  barrels in to  barrels in  increasing revenue by approximately  this was partly offset by the impact of a decrease in average ngl prices  which reduced revenue by approximately  the overall net decrease in oil and natural gas production was primarily due to a sale of producing oil and natural gas properties effective july  which effectively reduced production during the second half of by approximately  mcfe 
oil and natural gas production was further reduced during by production declines from existing wells offset by production from new gross  net  producing exploratory and development wells drilled and completed since december  included within natural gas revenues for the two years ended december  and was approximately million and  respectively  representing net losses and net gains from hedging activity 
the hedging settlements decreased the effective average natural gas prices by per mcf for the year ended december  and increased the effective average natural gas prices by per mcf for the year ended december  the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenue for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease production volumes natural gas mcf    oil and condensate bbls    natural gas liquids bbls    natural gas equivalent mcfe    average sales price natural gas per mcf oil and condensate per bbl natural gas liquids per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe operating revenue natural gas    oil and condensate    natural gas liquids    total    costs and operating expenses oil and natural gas operating expenses  including production and ad valorem taxes  decreased from million in to million in oil and natural gas operating expenses  including production and ad valorem taxes  on a unit of production basis were per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in per unit costs reflects an intensive monitoring of field level costs plus the addition of several high volume low cost wells to the production stream during dd a decreased from million in to million in included within dd a for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing depletion expense of oil and natural gas properties 
an decrease in the overall depletion rate decreased depletion expense by approximately million 
the decrease in the depletion rate was primarily due to a full cost ceiling test write down of oil and natural gas properties of approximately million at december  offset by the abandonment of certain properties during the fourth quarter of decreased oil and natural gas production further decreased depletion expense by approximately  depletion on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the remaining decrease in dd a was due primarily to the amortization of deferred loan costs on the revolving credit facility  which were fully amortized at march  the commission requires that the carrying cost of proved reserves be assessed periodically for ceiling test impairment 
at december   as a result of the company s carrying cost of proved reserves being in excess of the present value using a discount rate of  the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of approximately million 
at december   no ceiling test write down was necessary 
g a decreased from million in to million in included as a reduction in g a for the years ended december  and  was approximately  and  respectively  of overhead reimbursements and management fees received from various management  operating and seismic agreements 
excluding the reduction of g a attributable to overhead reimbursements  g a decreased by approximately  due primarily to lower costs of outside professional services  discontinuing of international new business development and a company wide focus on cost reduction 
general and administrative expenses on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and were per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the increase in g a on a per unit of production basis was due to lower production volumes during which were largely attributable to the mid year sale of proved producing properties referred to above 
unearned compensation expense decreased from  in to  in the amortization of unearned compensation expense is recognized from restricted stock granted to executives at the completion of the offering 
the decrease is due to the resignation of the former ceo and chairman of the board during november of whereby he vested in his remaining restricted stock grant 
the company charged to expense during his remaining unamortized unearned compensation upon his resignation 
the other charge during of approximately million primarily represents expenses incurred as a result of james d

the balance of the special charge primarily represents cash payments to be paid to mr 
calaway from the date of his resignation to january interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  net of interest capitalized to oil and natural gas properties of approximately  and  respectively 
the weighted average debt was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in the decrease was due to the offering proceeds being fully deployed in operations by the end of the first quarter of for the year ended december   the company had a tax benefit of  as a result of the cumulative effect of the accounting change  the company recorded a provision for taxes payable during the second quarter of with the corresponding tax expense being recorded as a reduction of the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
as a result of losses generated during the second half of  a tax benefit was recognized to the extent of previously recorded provision for taxes payable 
due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards and other net deferred tax assets there is no provision for current or deferred taxes for the year ended december  as of december  and  the company had available a substantial net operating loss carryforward and other net deferred tax assets and should the company have taxable income in future periods a provision for tax expense will be provided 
for the year ended december   the company had an operating loss of million as compared to an operating loss of million in the significant decrease in the operating loss was primarily attributable to the full cost ceiling test write down of approximately million recorded in the operating loss during was further decreased by lower dd a  lower oil and natural gas operating expenses and lower g a offset by lower oil and natural gas revenue which was reduced due to a decline in natural gas production due to a mid year property sale and lower natural gas prices 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  or basic and diluted loss per share of  as compared to net loss of million  a net loss of million before cumulative effect of accounting change  or basic and diluted loss per share of for liquidity and capital resources in march  the company completed the offering of  shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the offering provided the company with proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
the company used approximately million to repay its long term outstanding indebtedness incurred under its revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  subordinated loans and equipment loans

on may   the company completed a private offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the company also issued warrants  which were purchased for per warrant  to acquire an additional  shares of common stock at per share and are exercisable through may  at the election of the company  the warrants may be called at a redemption price of per warrant at any time after any date at which the average daily per share closing bid price for the immediately proceeding consecutive trading days exceeds 
no warrants have been exercised as of december  total proceeds  net of offering costs  were approximately million of which million was used to repay debt under the revolving credit facility with the remainder being utilized to satisfy working capital requirements and to fund a portion of the company s exploration program 
pursuant to the terms of the private placement  the company filed a registration statement with the commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock and the warrants sold in the private placement  as well as the resale of any shares of common stock issued pursuant to such warrants 
the company had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to  at december  working capital was million as of december  as compared to million at december  excluding the current portion of long term debt  working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  cash flows provided by operations were million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended december  is primarily due to net income of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million in  partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable 
high commodity prices during the fourth quarter of resulted in substantial accounts receivable balances for production revenue received in operating cash flows  before changes in working capital  were million for the year ended december  and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to higher oil and natural gas revenues during as a result of higher average commodity prices that were partly offset by lower production 
the company reinvests a substantial portion of its cash flows to increase its d project portfolio  improve its d seismic interpretation technology and to fund its drilling program 
as a result  the company used million in investing activities during including capital expenditures of approximately million 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to land holdings and million was attributable to increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties of million and net proceeds from the sale of our investment in frontera of million 
during the year ended december   the company used million of cash in investing activities including capital expenditures of approximately million 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to increased land holdings and million was attributable to increased seismic data and other geologic and geophysical expenditures

capital expenditures were offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas prospects of million 
during august  the company completed a transaction in which it sold  effective july   its working interests in proved producing and undeveloped properties within its bta and spartan extension d project areas in goliad and victoria counties  texas 
proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
during the year ended december   the company continued to reinvest a substantial portion of its cash flows to increase its d project portfolio  improve its d seismic interpretation technology and fund its drilling program 
as a result  the company used million in investing activities during including capital expenditures of approximately million for oil and natural gas property development offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas prospects of million 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful  with the majority of the remaining capital expenditures representing additions to undeveloped oil and natural gas properties which has expanded and diversified our portfolio of future drilling opportunities 
pursuant to a rights offering conducted by frontera in november  the company agreed to purchase  shares of frontera common stock plus such additional shares  if necessary  to maintain its then current interest of the partially diluted outstanding frontera common stock assuming conversion of all preferred stock 
as a result  the company paid frontera  in december for  shares of frontera common stock   in january for  shares of frontera common stock and  in april for  shares of frontera common stock bring its total investment in frontera to  the company sold its interest in frontera in june for net proceeds of million 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be approximately million including capitalized interest and g a of approximately million 
a substantial portion of capital expenditures in will be invested in the company s portfolio of prospects to fund drilling activities approximately gross wells in an effort to expand its reserve base 
in addition  the company will seek to continue to expand and improve its technological and seismic interpretation capabilities 
cash flows used in financing activities in were million compared to cash flows from financing activities of million in financing activities during included borrowings of million and repayments of million under our revolving credit facility and the predecessor facility 
we also incurred loan costs of approximately  in establishing our new credit facility 
financing activities during were comprised of a private offering of common stock that generated net proceeds of million offset by a net repayment of debt of million

the company intends to fund its capital expenditures  commitments and working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  and to the extent necessary other financing activities 
the projected cash flows from operations are projected to be sufficient to fund its budgeted exploration and development program and to provide additional working capital 
the company believes it will be able to generate capital resources and liquidity sufficient to fund its capital expenditures and meet such financial obligations as they come due 
in the event such capital resources are not available to the company  its drilling and other activities may be curtailed

credit facility in october  we entered into a new credit facility the new credit facility with a new bank 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to prime plus or libor plus 
we borrowed million under the new facility and repaid the million outstanding under our prior facility with a combination of borrowings and cash on hand 
in december  we paid an additional million to reduce our outstanding debt balance to million at december  as of march   no borrowings were outstanding under the new credit facility 
the new credit facility matures october  and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
originally the borrowing base under the new credit facility was million and was subject to automatic reductions at a rate of  per month beginning february  in march  the new credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing base to million  and to eliminate the  per month automatic reduction 
the borrowing base will be redetermined on a semi annual basis 
the new credit facility provides for certain restrictions  including but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings and issues of capital stock  sales of oil and natural gas properties or other collateral  engaging in merger or consolidation transactions 
the new credit facility also prohibits dividends and certain distributions of cash or properties and certain liens 
the new credit facility also contains certain financial covenants 
the ebitda to interest expense ratio requires that a consolidated ebitda  as defined in the agreement  of the company for the four fiscal quarters then ended to b the consolidated interest expense of the company for the four fiscal quarters then ended  to not be less than to the working capital ratio requires that the amount of the company s consolidated current assets less its consolidated liabilities  as defined in the agreement  be at least million 
the allowable expenses ratio requires that a the aggregate amount of the company s year to date consolidated general and administrative expenses for the period from january of such year through the fiscal quarter then ended to b the company s year to date consolidated oil and gas revenues  net of hedging activity  for the period from january of such year through the fiscal quarter then ended  to be less than 
to at december   the company was in compliance with the above mentioned covenants 
accounting change the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
in the second quarter of and effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for direct internal geological and geophysical g g costs to one of capitalization of such costs  which are directly attributable to acquisition  exploration and development activities  to oil and natural gas property 
prior to the change the company expensed these costs as incurred 
the company believes the accounting change provides for a better matching of revenues and expenses and enhances the comparability of its results of operations with those of other oil and natural gas companies that follow the full cost method of accounting see note 
accounting pronouncements derivatives the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas effective january  the statement  as amended  requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value  and changes in the fair value of derivatives be reported in current earnings  unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedge 
if the intended use of the derivative is to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  a liability or firm commitment  then the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by the change in the item s fair value 
however  if the intended use of the derivative is to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows then the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be reported in other comprehensive income oci 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in oci will be reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
the company will account for its natural gas and crude oil hedge derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  as defined 
although the fair value of the company s derivative instruments fluctuates daily  as of january   the fair value of the company s natural gas hedge derivative instrument was approximately million  which is not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the million will be recorded as a liability on the company s balance sheet as part of the transition adjustment related to the company s adoption of sfas the offset to this balance sheet adjustment will be a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the entire amount relates to anticipated transactions and will be reclassified to earnings during the company believes the adoption of sfas will result in more volatility in its financial statements than in the past 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf no 
accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
eitf no 
addresses how shipping and handling fees should be classified in the income statement 
the adoption of this standard had no impact as the company had historically reported such costs separately 
hedging activities in december  the company entered into a natural gas collar that covers  mmbtu per day for the period january  to december  at a floor of per mmbtu and a ceiling of per mmbtu 
on january   the company closed out the hedge for the period february  to december  at a cost of  as of march   the company has no hedges in place 
edge believes that hedges should be used as a financial tool to protect against the effects of a leveraged capital structure  ensure project rates of return from acquisitions and to help management budget and plan 
recommendations with respect to hedging opportunities are made by both the financial and marketing departments to edge s management committee and chief executive officer for approval 
the administration of hedges  if any  is handled jointly by the finance and marketing departments 
tax matters at december   the company had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that will begin to expire in the company anticipates that all of these nols may be utilized in connection with federal income taxes payable for the year ended december  as a result  the company s cash outflows in respect of tax payments may be higher for and future periods 
nols assume that certain items  primarily intangible drilling costs have been written off in the current year 
however  the company has not made a final determination if an election will be made to capitalize all or part of these items for tax purposes 
due to the ownership change of the company s predecessors  future utilization of the nols is limited by the internal revenue code section item a
