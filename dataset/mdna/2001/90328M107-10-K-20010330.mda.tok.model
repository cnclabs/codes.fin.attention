item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview usana develops and manufactures high quality nutritional  personal care and weight management products 
usana distributes its products through a network marketing system 
as of december   usana had approximately  current associates in the united states  canada  australia  new zealand  hong kong  japan and the united kingdom 
direct export sales to customers in japan for personal use only were commenced in september the financial results for any quarter and year ended within this report  as reported  are adjusted to reflect the financial accounting standards board guidelines on revenue recognition pursuant to emerging issues task force no eitf 
under eitf guidelines  historical and future revenue relating to amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling should be classified as revenue 
the corresponding expenses are reported as cost of sales 
historically  usana has reported freight income and expense as a net amount within selling  general and administrative expense 
net sales are primarily dependent upon the efforts of a network of independent associates who purchase products and sales materials 
usana also offers a preferred customer program specifically designed for customers who desire to purchase products for personal consumption  but who choose not to distribute the products 
as of december   usana had approximately  preferred customers 
usana recognizes revenue when products are shipped and title passes to associates and preferred customers 
in  sales in the four primary markets  the united states  canada  australia new zealand  and hong kong  were   and  respectively  of net sales 
as usana expands into additional international markets  it expects international operations to account for an increasing percentage of net sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials  labor  quality assurance and overhead directly associated with the procurement and production of products and sales materials as well as duties and taxes associated with product exports 
in  products manufactured by usana accounted for approximately of net sales 
as international sales increase as a percentage of net sales  usana expects that its overall cost of sales could increase slightly  reflecting additional duties  freight and other expenses associated with international expansion 
associate incentives are the most significant expense and represented of net sales in associate incentives include commissions and leadership bonuses  and are paid weekly based on sales volume points 
most products are assigned a sales volume point value independent of the product s price 
associates earn commissions based on sales volume points generated in their downline 
generally  associate kits  sales aids and logo merchandise  such as items of clothing and luggage  have no sales volume point value and therefore usana does not pay commissions on the sale of these items 
usana closely monitors the amount of associate incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may from time to time adjust its associate compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings  while continuing to maintain an appropriate incentive for associates 
for example  in the first quarter of  usana introduced a value initiative that reduced prices across product lines an average of and decreased the ratio of sales volume points to the wholesale price on products purchased 
among other things  this resulted in a reduction in associate incentives and an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  rents and utilities  associate events  promotion and advertising  and professional fees along with other marketing and administrative expenses 
wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
usana expects to add human resources and associated infrastructure as operations expand 
the president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of usana is myron wentz phd dr 
wentz does not receive a salary and usana does not anticipate that he will take a salary for the foreseeable future 
however  if dr 
wentz were to take a salary  or if a new president or chief executive officer were retained and paid a customary salary and benefits  selling  general and administrative expenses would increase as a result of the compensation paid 
there is significant depreciation and amortization expense as a result of substantial investments in computer and telecommunications equipment and systems to support international expansion 
usana anticipates that additional capital investments will be required in future periods to promote and support growth in sales and the increasing size of the customer base  which includes both associates and preferred customers 
research and development expenses include costs incurred in developing new products  supporting and enhancing existing products and reformulating products for introduction in international markets 
usana capitalizes product development costs after market feasibility is established 
these costs are amortized as cost of sales over an average of months  beginning with the month the products become available for sale 
usana operates on a week year  ending on the saturday closest to december fiscal year covered the period december  to january  hereinafter

net sales decreased to million in  a decrease of million from million in the decrease in net sales is a result of the value initiative  introduced in february  which reduced prices by an average of  an overall decline in the associate base  weaker foreign currencies  relative to the us dollar  which negatively affected the translation of sales in foreign markets and the negative impact of the introduction of a goods and service tax in australia 
the decrease in the associate base was partially offset by strong enrollments of preferred customers 
the preferred customer base increased from the levels 
during  usana also had sales of approximately  to japan that were not present in the following tables illustrate the growth decline in net sales and customers by market for the years ended january  and december  sales by market in thousands year ended market change from prior year percent change united states    canada    australia new zealand    hong kong    consolidated    current associates by market market as of january  as of december  change from prior year percent change united states    canada    australia new zealand    hong kong    consolidated    preferred customers by market market as of january  as of december  change from prior year percent change united states    canada    australia new zealand    hong kong    consolidated    total customers by market market as of january  as of december  change from prior year percent change united states    canada    australia new zealand    hong kong    consolidated    gross profit 
gross profit decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales can be attributed to the value initiative  which reduced prices by an average of  inefficiencies in shipping approximately more product as a result of the value initiative  the compressions of gross margins as a result of the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  the operating of production at less than capacity near the end of to reduce inventory levels  which resulted in overhead and direct labor costs flowing directly through cost of sales instead of being capitalized as a component of inventory and product development costs resulting from new products introduced during usana believes that gross profit for will be similar to results reported for as a percentage of net sales 
associate incentives 
associate incentives decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease in associate incentives relative to net sales can be primarily attributed to the value initiative  which decreased the ratio of sales volume points to the wholesale price on customer product purchases 
associate incentives are paid on the amount of sales volume points generated 
usana believes associate incentives as a percent of net sales in the foreseeable future will continue to be similar to results reported for selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales from in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses can be attributed to sales and marketing activities to promote and support the value initiative  inefficiencies in customer service expenses dealing with customer issues from a larger and changing customer base as a result of the value initiative  spending in usana s newest market  japan  and in potential future markets and increased spending on activities related to our annual international convention 
usana has taken measures to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses for however  these expenses will continue to be pressured by the cost of the hard launch in japan scheduled for late and as a result of costs to pursue new international opportunities 
restructuring 
usana recorded a restructuring charge and reserve totaling million million after tax in the third quarter of the restructuring charge included the impact of a substantial reduction in united kingdom operations  liquidation of associated assets in the united kingdom and reduction of staff outside of the united kingdom 
usana did not have a similar charge in and does not expect one in the foreseeable future 
impairment 
in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we wrote off the remaining book value of our former custom network marketing system totaling million million after tax in the third quarter of this charge was the result of usana s decision to move to a new custom network marketing system 
this was a one time charge in and did not affect results 
interest expense 
interest expense increased substantially to of net sales from in as a result of the debt incurred during and early the debt was incurred as a result of the repurchase of million shares of usana s common stock from gull holdings  ltd  usana s largest shareholder  and open market purchases of approximately  shares under a share repurchase program 
net earnings 
net earnings decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease in net earnings can primarily be attributed to lower than expected sales  substantially higher selling  general and administrative expenses and higher interest expense on debt incurred to fund the repurchase of common stock in and early diluted earnings per share were for  a decrease of from in years ended january  and january  net sales 
net sales increased to million in  an increase of million from million in the increase in net sales is primarily a result of introducing two new markets the united kingdom in december and hong kong in november sales growth can also be attributed to a increase in the preferred customer base 
as of january   usana had approximately  preferred customers compared to approximately  preferred customers at january  approximately of the increase in preferred customers took place in the north american and australia new zealand markets 
as of january   usana had approximately  current associates compared to  current associates at january  the following tables illustrate the growth decline in sales and customers by market for the years ended january  and january  sales by market in thousands year ended change from prior year percent change market united states   canada    australia new zealand    hong kong   consolidated    current associates by market market as of january  as of january  change from prior year percent change united states    canada    australia new zealand    hong kong   consolidated    preferred customers by market market as of january  as of january  change from prior year percent change united states    canada    australia new zealand    hong kong   consolidated    total customers by market market as of january  as of january  change from prior year percent change united states    canada    australia new zealand    hong kong   consolidated    gross profit 
gross profit increased to of net sales in from in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales can be attributed to a change in sales mix to fewer associate kits  sales aids and logo merchandise  which are sold at a reduced gross profit margin compared to other usana products  and increased production and procurement efficiencies 
associate incentives 
as a percentage of net sales  associate incentives decreased to in from in the decrease in associate incentives relative to net sales can be attributed to continued efforts at managing product pricing  which has created a spread between the wholesale price of the products and the related sales volume points  the introduction of the new level in the associate compensation plan in early  and inefficiencies in the associate network in the united kingdom and hong kong 
the new level  or position  in the associate compensation plan represents the earliest level in the network marketing system eligible to receive incentives 
usana believes this new level will assist in associate retention efforts by paying these associates earlier on reduced downline requirements  however  this level pays at a lower rate than other levels in the network marketing system 
selling  general and administrative 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses can be attributed to higher relative costs associated with operations in the united kingdom  increased spending on sales and marketing efforts  increased costs including  but not limited to  employee compensation as a result of building infrastructure to meet strategic objectives  and increased depreciation and amortization expense as a result of substantial investments in current and prior periods in computer and telecommunications equipment to support growth and international expansion

because usana s products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  usana is highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality and efficacy of its products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more of usana s products or other products similar to usana s products could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors usana s quarterly revenues  expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that usana will be able to increase its revenues in future periods or be able to sustain its level of revenue or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
furthermore  no assurances can be given that revenue growth rate in new markets where operations have not commenced will follow this pattern 
due to the foregoing factors  future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if that occurred  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources usana has historically financed growth primarily with cash flows from operations 
in  usana generated net cash from operations of million compared to million in usana had to use proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as well as funds from its line of credit to meet liquidity and capital resource needs during cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at january  checks written in excess of cash in bank which is included in the line of credit balance totaled million at december  on december   usana had net working capital of million compared to working capital deficit of million at january  the improvement in net working capital was primarily the result of a reduction in the current maturities of long term debt and a reduction in the restructuring provision 
usana does not extend credit to its customers  but requires payment prior to shipping  which eliminates significant receivables 
usana invested million in property and equipment in compared to million in inventory increased to million at december  compared to million at january  as of december   usana had commitments for two significant capital expenditures 
the first is for expanded warehouse space at an approximate cost of million of which  was paid during the second commitment is for improving existing technology systems at an approximate cost of million of which million was paid during during  usana entered into agreements with a financial institution to provide up to million in secured credit facilities consisting of a million five year term loan and a million three year revolving line of credit 
at december   usana had million available under the line of credit  which expires september  the interest rate is computed at the bank s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor base rate adjusted by features specified in the credit facilities 
usana may choose to borrow at the bank s publicly announced reference rate plus a margin per annum as specified in the credit facilities or  at the option of usana  loans within the approved commitment may be available in minimum amounts of  or more for specific periods ranging from one to six months  at libor plus a margin as specified in the credit facilities 
at december   the interest rate in effect for the credit facilities was 
real estate  receivables  inventories and equipment secure the credit facilities 
the credit facilities contain restrictive covenants requiring usana to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   usana was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
the bank waived this covenant for the third and fourth quarters of as of december   million was outstanding on the five year term loan and million was outstanding on the line of credit 
the credit facilities were amended in march the amended credit facilities reduced the revolving line of credit to million and does not require usana to make quarterly principal payments on the term loan for the next five quarters 
this amendment effectively reduced the amount available under the line of credit to million at december  usana believes that its current cash balances  the available line of credit and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to cover its needs in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future 
if usana experiences an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms 
usana may also require or seek additional financing  including through the sale of its equity securities to finance future expansion into new markets  finance capital acquisitions associated with the growth of usana and for other reasons 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments convertible into equity securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to existing shareholders 
inflation usana does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its historical operations or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct our business in several countries and intend to continue to expand our foreign operations 
net sales  earnings from operations and net earnings are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  usana s operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
foreign currency risks 
usana conducts business in several countries and intends to continue to expand its foreign operations 
sales outside the united states represented  and of net sales in   and  respectively 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency with all revenue and expenses translated at weighted average exchange rates for reported periods 
consequently  usana s reported sales and earnings are impacted positively by a weakening of the us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which usana sells its products 
usana seeks to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts 
we do not use such derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on usana s operating results 
as of december   usana had no hedging instruments in place to offset exposure to the canadian dollar  australian dollar  new zealand dollar  hong kong dollar  japanese yen  british pound and euro  to which  in aggregate  usana had significant exposure 
in future years  when usana has foreign currency exchange contracts in place at year end  we will present the required information in tabular form 
as a last recourse for hedging currency risk  usana may elect to adjust prices in non us markets to reflect changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  there can be no assurance that these practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks encountered in connection with its foreign currency transactions 
interest rate risks 
usana currently carries million in long term debt at an effective interest rate of 
this long term debt matures at the rate of million in  million in and million in usana also had a revolving line of credit with million outstanding at december  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the interest rate is computed at the bank s prime rate or libor adjusted by features specified in usana s loan agreements  with fixed rate term options of up to six months 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on all of the above debt would result in an annual after tax increase of interest expense of approximately  which would translate to per diluted share 
forward looking statements and certain risks the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements regard our expectations  hopes  beliefs  commitments  intentions and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases such as believes  expects  anticipates  should  plans  estimates  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding our financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future and the sufficiency of our existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward looking statements or for the reasons discussed below 
the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to past reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
we believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate and compete and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in these forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations include the following as a network marketing company  we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products and the failure to attract and maintain a sufficient number of associates could adversely affect our business 
we rely on non employee  independent associates to purchase  market and sell our products 
associates are independent contractors who purchase products directly for their own use or for resale 
associates typically work at the distribution of the products on a part time basis and may and likely will engage in other business activities  some of which may compete with us 
we have a large number of associates and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and provide motivational support to our associates 
we undertake no effort to provide individual training to associates 
associates may voluntarily terminate their agreements with us at any time 
there is typically significant turnover in associates from year to year 
because of this high turnover  we must continually recruit new associates 
our net sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of these non employee  independent associates and future growth in sales volume will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of new associates and improving productivity of the associates 
consequently  the loss of a key associate or group of associates  large turnovers or decreases in the size of the associate force  seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume  sales volume reduction and the costs associated with training new associates and other related expenses may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the ability to continue to attract and retain associates can be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general business and economic conditions  public perceptions about network marketing programs  high visibility investigations or legal proceeding against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens  and public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional  personal care or weight management products generally 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain associates in numbers sufficient to sustain future growth or to maintain present growth levels  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not directly control the independent acts of associates and the violation of applicable laws in the sale of our products or the promotion of our compensation plan could adversely affect our business 
associates are required to sign and adhere to our associate application and agreement  which obligates them to abide by usana policies and procedures 
although these policies and procedures prohibit associates from making certain claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products  associates may from time to time create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe our marketing program 
they also may make statements regarding potential earnings  product claims or other matters in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters 
such violations may result in legal action by regulatory agencies 
future legal actions against associates or others associated with us could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business  including our network marketing system 
we take what we believe to be commercially reasonable steps to monitor associate activities to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by associates and to assure that the terms of our compensation plan are observed 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective 
publicity resulting from these associate activities can also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain associates and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny and regulation  which adds to the expense of doing business and the possibility that changes in the law might adversely affect our ability to market some of our products in certain markets 
network marketing systems such as ours are frequently subject to laws and regulations directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than investment in the sponsoring company 
in the united states  these laws and regulations include the federal and state securities laws  the regulation of the offer and sale of franchises and business opportunities  regulations and statutes administered by the ftc and various state anti pyramid and business opportunity laws that target direct selling businesses that promise quick rewards for little or no effort  require high entry costs  use high pressure recruiting methods or do not involve legitimate products 
similar laws govern our activities in foreign countries where it presently has operations or may have operations in the future 
we are subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  our marketing system could be found not to comply with these laws and regulations or may be prohibited 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network marketing channel in some foreign countries 
our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception 
our ability to attract and retain associates and to sustain and enhance sales through our associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry  our competition or our business generally 
this negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of network marketing  the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations of  regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our associates or the business practices or products of our competitors or other network marketing companies 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key management personnel would adversely affect our business 
we depend on the services of our founder  dr 
wentz  who serves as our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we also rely on our other executive officers 
dr 
wentz is a highly visible spokesman for our products and our business  and we believe our success depends in large part on the continued visibility and reputation of dr 
wentz  which helps distinguish us from our competitors 
dr 
wentz is not a permanent resident of the united states and will likely spend no more than four months per year in the united states  however he devotes a majority of his time to our business and travels outside the united states to direct and promote our international expansion 
the loss or limitation of dr 
wentz s services as the lead spokesman for our business or our products  as a key developer of those products or as one of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our executive officers other than dr 
wentz are primarily responsible for our day to day operations  and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team 
we do not maintain a key man life insurance policy on dr 
wentz or any of our other officers  nor do we have an employment agreement with any of our officers 
the loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ownership of a significant amount of our common stock gives dr 
wentz effective control and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues 
gull holdings  ltd  which is solely owned and controlled by dr 
wentz  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock at december  by virtue of this stock ownership  gull holdings  ltd 
may be able to exert significant influence over the election of the members of our board of directors and to exert significant influence over our affairs 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to stockholders 
in addition  dr 
wentz and his son david wentz currently serve on the board of directors 
there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to these directors or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to us 
there is no assurance of future industry growth 
there can be no assurance that the nutritional supplement market is as large as reported or that projected or expected growth will occur or continue 
market data and projections  such as those presented in this form k  are inherently uncertain and subject to change 
in addition  the underlying market conditions are subject to change based on economic conditions  consumer references and other factors that are beyond our control 
recently  various publicly traded nutritional supplement companies  as well as industry analysts  have announced that there is a slow down in sales of nutritional supplements 
there can be no assurance that an adverse change in size or growth rate of this market will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and other countries 
details of these regulations are contained in business regulatory matters 
failure to comply with applicable fda regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any action of this type by the fda could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in addition  if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated eg  we do not possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
the ftc has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement  both administratively and judicially  including compulsory process authority  cease and desist orders and injunctions 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any action by the ftc could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing our products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
for example  our manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda and health canada and is certified by australia s tga 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
these activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies or the countries in which our products are sold 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business in the future 
they could include  however  requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 
our business expansion into foreign markets is subject to risks 
we commenced operations in australia and new zealand in february  in the united kingdom in december and in hong kong in november in we began limited business activity in japan 
we believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow in our existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis or that new markets will be profitable 
we must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any foreign market 
also  before marketing commences it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
we may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country 
once we have entered a market  we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers 
the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals or that we will have sufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner 
in many market areas  other network marketing companies already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local associate population to a new opportunity such as usana  or to make it more difficult for us to recruit qualified associates 
there can be no assurance that  even if we are able to commence operations in foreign countries  there will be a sufficiently large population of persons inclined to participate in a network marketing system such as ours 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our associate compensation plan across all markets in which our products are sold 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program 
the increase in associate incentives expense reduces profitability 
since inception  we generally have experienced increases  as a percentage of net sales  in the amount of incentives  including commissions and leadership bonuses  paid to our associates 
from time to time we have changed our associate compensation plan to better manage these incentives 
for example  during the third quarter of  we introduced a broad repricing strategy across our product lines  creating a spread between the price the associate pays for the product and the sales volume point value associated with the product 
at the same time  we changed our leadership bonus program  increasing the payout from to of total sales volume points 
in february  we introduced a broad repricing initiative reducing the average price of our products by approximately 
this initiative actually decreased the amount of incentives as a percentage of net sales 
management closely monitors the amount of associate incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may adjust our associate compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings 
there can be no assurance that these changes or future changes to the associate compensation plan or product pricing will be successful in maintaining the level of associate incentives expense as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  these changes may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and motivated associates 
we rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems 
our success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology 
our information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing  maintain associate and preferred customer records  accurately track purchases and incentive payments  manage accounting  finance and manufacturing operations  generate reports and provide customer service and technical support 
any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize the need to regularly upgrade our management information systems to most effectively manage our operations and associate database 
the loss of a significant associate or downline organization could adversely affect our business 
we rely on the successful efforts of certain associates 
our associate compensation plan is designed to permit associates to sponsor new associates  creating multiple business centers  or levels in the marketing structure 
sponsored associates are referred to as downline associates within the sponsoring associate s downline network 
if these downline associates in turn sponsor new associates  additional business centers are created  with the new downline associates becoming part of the original sponsor s downline network 
as a result of this network marketing system  associates develop business relationships with other associates 
we believe our revenue is generated by thousands of associates 
however  the loss of a high level sponsoring associate  together with a group of leading associates in that person s downline  or the loss of a significant number of associates for any reason  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger  wealthier and more established competitors 
we face intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements  vitamins and minerals  personal care products  weight management items  and other nutritional products as described in greater detail in business competition 
numerous manufacturers  distributors and retailers compete actively for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutrition  personal care and weight management products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution including retail stores 
our product offerings in each product category are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other companies 
we are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time  attention and commitment of new and existing associates 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in the business opportunities presented by direct selling tends to be limited in each market  and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
our foreign expansion subjects our business to the increased expense and risks associated with foreign duties and import restrictions 
at present  most of our products are manufactured in the united states and are exported to the countries in which they ultimately are sold 
the countries in which we operate may impose various legal restrictions on imports 
in most cases  permits or licenses are required to import particular types of goods  including products of the type we manufacture and sell 
duties of varying amounts are imposed based on the values or quantities of the goods imported 
in certain countries and jurisdictions  nutritional and other products are subject to significant import duties 
certain products that we export from the united states  notably products in the personal care line are subject to foreign health and safety regulations 
certain nutritional products may also be subject to governmental regulations regarding food and drugs  which regulations may limit our ability to sell some of our products in some countries and jurisdictions 
to date  we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining or maintaining import licenses  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these licenses or obtain the necessary licenses to enter new markets 
in addition  new regulations may be adopted or any of the existing regulations could be changed at any time in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
duties on imports could be changed in a manner that would be materially adverse to our sales and our competitive position compared to locally produced goods 
in addition  import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions may prevent the importation of us manufactured products altogether 
taxation and transfer pricing considerations affect our foreign operations 
our principal domicile is the united states 
sales in the united states  canada  australia new zealand and hong kong represented   and of total sales in fiscal year  respectively 
we are subject to income taxes at an effective rate of    and in the united states  canada  new zealand  australia and hong kong  respectively 
under tax treaties  we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for taxes actually paid abroad 
as our operations expand outside the united states  taxes paid to foreign taxing authorities may exceed amounts of the credits available to us  resulting in the payment of a higher overall effective tax rate on our worldwide operations 
we have adopted transfer pricing agreements with our subsidiaries to regulate intercompany transfers  which agreements are subject to transfer pricing laws that regulate the flow of funds between the subsidiaries and the parent corporation for product purchases  management services and contractual obligations such as the payment of associate incentives 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in our transfer pricing practices  we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings would be adversely affected 
we believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable foreign exchange control and transfer pricing laws 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with foreign exchange control and transfer pricing laws  or that those laws will not be modified  which  as a result  may require changes in our operating procedures 
exchange rate fluctuations affect foreign operations 
over the past several years  an increasing amount of our net sales have been generated outside the united states 
we intend to continue to expand our foreign operations  exposing us to risks of changes in social  political and economic conditions in foreign countries  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where we have operations 
since a significant portion of our sales is in foreign countries  exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on our sales and gross margins 
further  if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically  it may become uneconomical for us to establish or continue activities in certain countries 
for instance  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which foreign competitors and we sell similar products in the same market 
as our business expands outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accounting practices require that our non us sales and selling  general and administrative expenses be converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally increasing with a weaker us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
product purchases by our foreign subsidiaries are transacted in us dollars 
as operations expand in countries where foreign currency transactions may be made  our operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of these changes on our future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect our sales to customers outside the united states 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
we generally do not use derivative instruments to manage currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that hedging transactions will protect operating results and cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
those adverse effects would also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials 
we acquire all of our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third party suppliers 
normally  materials used in manufacturing our products are purchased on account or by purchase order 
we have very few long term agreements for the supply of these materials 
there is a risk that any of our suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue selling their products to us 
although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages and back orders for the products  with a resulting loss of net sales 
in certain situations we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source 
in addition  we rely on third party manufacturers for several of our products  including our food bars and drink mixes 
we have in the past discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials needed by us in the quantities requested or at a price we are willing to pay 
because we does not control the actual production of these raw materials  we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials based on conditions not within our control  including weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies 
our products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins  minerals  herbs and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption 
some of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients 
although we believe all of our products to be safe when taken as directed  there is little long term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form 
we conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products  but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies 
furthermore  because we are highly dependent on consumers perception of the efficacy  safety and quality of our products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies  we could be adversely affected in the event those products should prove or be asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers use or misuse of our products or a competitor s similar products 
as a manufacturer we may be subject to product liability claims 
as a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application  we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation to prosecute such claims 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers as a result of tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
to date  we have not been party to any product liability litigation  although certain individuals have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our nutritional products 
these matters historically have been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims 
although we maintain product liability insurance which we believes to be adequate for our needs  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
our business is subject to particular intellectual property risks 
we do not own any patents 
the labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers 
accordingly  patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common 
additionally  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and interactions among various substances 
in this respect  we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer and more effective formulations of our nutritional or other products 
we protect our investment in research  as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products by relying on trade secret laws  although we have not to date entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees involved in research and development activities 
additionally  we endeavor to seek  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  trademark and trade dress protection for our products  which protection has been sought in the united states  canada and many of the other countries in which we are either presently operating or plan to commence operations in the near future 
our research and development efforts have and may at some future time result in patentable products  however  no assurance can be given that patents would be obtained 
notwithstanding our efforts as described above  there can be no assurance that such efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
if an infringement claim is asserted  we may be required to obtain a license of such rights  pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our products that are alleged to have infringed 
litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
there can be no assurance  however  that third party claims will not in the future adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
our results of operations are dependent upon the continued operation of our manufacturing facility in salt lake city  utah 
the operation of a nutritional supplement manufacturing facility involves many risks  including power failures  the breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies  including the fda 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials 
our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances 
nevertheless  complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions  and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities or satisfying business requirements following any period affected by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and subject to various market conditions 
there can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained 
the trading price of the common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the price of the common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the nutritional supplement industry  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional  supplement companies and which have  in certain cases  not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially
