for a discussion of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward looking statements  including  but not limited to  factors associated with the build out of our portion of the nextel digital mobile network  actions of regulatory authorities and competitors and other factors  see risk factors 
please read the following discussion together with the selected consolidated financial data  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
our historical results discussed in this section and throughout this document include the operations we acquired from nextel wip on january  in connection with our initial capitalization  which operations had previously been managed by nextel 
see note of our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our formation  capitalization and basis of presentation 
overview on september  we completed the exercise of our option to acquire from nextel wip frequencies in additional markets where approximately million people  or pops  live and work 
as a result  we currently hold or have the right to use wireless frequencies in markets where over million people live and work 
as of december   we had commercial operations in markets with total pops of approximately million and the ability to offer service to  or cover  approximately million pops 
these operational markets are in hawaii  new york  texas  pennsylvania  kentucky  florida  iowa  nebraska  idaho  central illinois  alabama  louisiana  mississippi  georgia and tennessee 
as of december   we had approximately  digital subscribers 
our subscriber base grew compared to december  with an ending subscriber count of approximately  in june we introduced wireless web services formerly known as nextel online and by the end of we offered this data service in all of our launched markets 
wireless web service provides internet capable subscriber units with wireless internet services  including web based applications and content 
due to the continued development  build out and enhancement of our portion of the nextel digital mobile network  we expect to continue to experience negative operating margins 
in addition  we anticipate costs such as site rentals  telecommunications expenses  network equipment and other capital items to increase 
sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs are also expected to increase with the commercialization of service in new markets 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our primary sources of revenues are service revenues and equipment revenues 
service revenues increased to million for when compared to million recognized during our service revenues consist of charges for airtime usage and monthly network access fees from providing integrated wireless services within our territory  particularly mobile telephone and two way radio dispatch services 
service revenues also include roaming revenues related to the use by nextel subscribers of our portion of the nextel digital mobile network 
roaming revenues for accounted for approximately of our service revenues 
in december we changed our revenue recognition policy for activation fees included in service revenues and equipment phones revenues in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  effective january  this change in our revenue recognition policy became effective january  and as such  quarterly results for have been restated in notes and of the notes to the financial statements and these notes disclose the proforma change in results 
under this new policy  our activation fees and phone revenues are deferred and recognized over three years  the expected life of the customer relationship 
concurrently  the related costs for the phone equipment are deferred to the extent of deferred revenues  resulting in no change to ebitda or net loss 
the direct and incremental phone costs in excess of revenues generated from phone sales are expensed immediately as the amounts exceed our minimum contractual revenue 
the following table shows the results reported for and the impact of sab if the accounting policy had not been implemented along with reported results for and the pro forma if sab had been in effect for for the year ended december  for the year ended december  pre sab reported reported pro forma revenues service revenues     equipment revenues     total revenues     operating expenses cost of equipment revenues     ebitda     equipment revenues reported for  adjusted in accordance with the implementation of sab  were million compared to million reported for showing an increase of million or 
without adjusting for the impact of sab  equipment revenues would have increased  or million  during to million 
our equipment revenues consist of revenues received for wireless telephones purchased by our subscribers 
certain of our digital equipment sales are made through independent distributors under agreements allowing rights of return on merchandise unsold by the distributors 
through  we deferred recognition of such sales until the distributors sold the merchandise 
total revenues increased to million during when compared with million generated in total revenues reported for reflect the impact of sab  while total revenues reported for do not reflect this impact 
the growth in revenues was due to launching new markets along with increased revenues from the existing markets 
the following table sets forth those markets launched during and our previously launched markets markets market launch bristol johnson city kingsport  tn th quarter corpus christi victoria  tx th quarter macon warner robins  ga th quarter alexandria  la th quarter texarkana  tx rd quarter shreveport monroe tyler longview  la tx rd quarter central illinois peoria  springfield  champaign  bloomington  decatur nd quarter eastern iowa waterloo  dubuque  davenport  cedar rapids iowa city nd quarter nebraska omaha  lincoln nd quarter des moines  ia nd quarter idaho boise  twin falls nd quarter montgomery  al nd quarter pensacola panama city fort walton beach  fl nd quarter lafayette lake charles  la nd quarter mobile  al nd quarter beaumont  tx nd quarter pascagoula  ms nd quarter bryan college station  tx nd quarter harrisburg york lancaster  pa st quarter wilkes barre scranton  pa st quarter kentucky lexington fayette  louisville st quarter tallahassee  fl st quarter jamestown  ny st quarter temple killeen waco  tx th quarter erie  pa th quarter hawaii all islands rd quarter rochester  ny rd quarter buffalo  ny rd quarter syracuse utica rome binghamton elmira  ny rd quarter albany glen falls  ny rd quarter average revenue per unit  or arpu  is an industry term that measures total service revenues per month from our subscribers divided by the average number of digital subscriber units in commercial service for that month 
our arpu increased during the year to in  as compared to in we credit the higher arpu to increased minutes used by subscribers  higher pricing plans targeted for particular market segments  and additional features such as voice mail  short message services  wireless web services formerly known as nextel online and nextel worldwide products 
the following table sets forth our recent revenues and arpu revenues dollar amounts in thousands  except for arpu for the year ended december  of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  of consolidated revenues service and roaming revenues   equipment revenues   total revenues   arpu arpu was not adjusted for sab and does not include roaming revenues generated from the use by nextel subscribers on our portion of the nextel digital mobile network 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues consists primarily of network operating costs composed of site and switch rent  utilities  maintenance and interconnect charges 
it also includes the amounts we must pay nextel wip when our customers roam onto nextel s portion of the nextel digital mobile network 
these expenses depend mainly on the number of operating cell sites  total minutes of use and mix of minutes of use between interconnect and nextel direct connect services 
for our cost of service revenues were million compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of 
the increase in costs was primarily the result of bringing on air approximately  additional cell sites during for a total of approximately  operating cell sites  as well as increases in airtime usage 
increased airtime usage resulted from the growth in number of subscribers from along with the increased minutes of use per subscriber 
we expect cost of service revenues to increase as we place more cell sites in service and the usage of minutes increases as our subscriber base grows 
cost of equipment revenues cost of equipment revenues includes the cost of the subscriber wireless telephones and accessories sold by us 
our cost of equipment revenues reported for adjusted for sab was million 
without the effect of sab  our cost of equipment revenues for would have been million compared to million for  representing an increase of 
the increase in costs was related mostly to the growth in number of subscribers 
as part of our business plan  we often offer our equipment at a discount or as part of a promotion 
as a result  the difference between equipment revenues and cost of equipment revenues was a loss of million for  adjusted for sab  compared to a loss of million for without sab  net equipment margin for would have been a loss of million 
we expect to continue to employ these discounts and promotions in an effort to grow our number of subscribers 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we expect that cost of equipment revenues will continue to exceed our equipment revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  customer care services and general and administrative costs 
for these costs were million compared to million for  representing an increase of 
sales and marketing expenses relate to salaries for sales representatives and sales support personnel  and costs associated with indirect distribution channels  marketing and advertising programs 
these expenses increased as a result of increased sales and marketing activities to launch markets and grow our subscriber base  our hiring of additional sales and marketing employees to accommodate the growth in new and existing markets  and higher expenses related to higher sales from the indirect distribution channel 
general and administrative costs relate to corporate overhead personnel including tax  legal  planning  human resources  information technology  treasury  accounting and our customer care center operations 
the first six to nine months of was  for the most part  a transition period during which nextel wip made many of the above services available to us 
for the remainder of and during the majority of these services were transferred to our employees and systems 
therefore  our general and administrative costs increased as a result of our hiring employees to set up functional departments and offices to support the growth of the new and existing markets  staffing and operating our own customer care and fulfillment service center in las vegas  nv to support the growing subscriber base  and hiring employees to maintain and support systems that were in development during stock based compensation expense for and  we recorded stock based compensation expense associated with our restricted stock purchase plan and employee stock options granted during of million and million  respectively 
this expense is a non cash expense 
prior to our initial public offering  grants were considered compensatory and accounted for on a basis similar to that used for stock appreciation rights 
at our initial public offering february   the intrinsic value of the options and restricted stock was recorded and is being amortized over the remaining vesting periods 
depreciation and amortization expense for  our depreciation and amortization expense was million compared to million for  representing an increase of 
the million increase related primarily to depreciating the wireless network assets for approximately  additional cell sites placed in service along with the furniture and equipment to set up the new offices and amortizing additional fcc licensed radio spectrum associated with the new markets launched 
interest expense and interest income interest expense  net of capitalized interest  increased from million for to million for  representing an increase of 
the increase was due to the million term loan c obtained in september  and the issuance of million in senior notes in march and an additional million in senior notes in july  offset by redeeming of the senior discount notes in april for  interest income was million  compared to million for  representing an increase of 
this increase was due to the income recognized on the investment of the net proceeds received from the term loan c in september  our initial public offering of class a common stock in february and the issuance of senior notes in march and july extraordinary item on april  we utilized a portion of our proceeds from our initial public offering in february to redeem of the aggregate accreted value of the senior discount notes 
as a result of the early retirement of these senior discount notes  we recognized an extraordinary loss of approximately million  representing the excess of the redemption price over the accreted value of the notes redeemed 
net loss for we had losses attributable to common stockholders of approximately million compared to a loss of million for  representing an increase of 
the million loss for includes an extraordinary loss of approximately million and a dividend relating to mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of million 
expenses increased in all categories as we transitioned from a start up mode  launched new markets  added subscriber usage to the network  hired staff  set up functional departments and offices  and increased marketing and sales activities for the newly launched markets 
we anticipate reporting net losses for the foreseeable future as we grow and expand to meet the requirements of the business 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  total revenues were primarily generated from our upstate new york and hawaii markets  which became operational in july and september  respectively 
revenues increased from to due to the growth in the number of subscribers since the initial launch 
from the year ended december  to the year ended december   our subscriber base increased from approximately  to  the following table sets forth our revenues and arpu for the years ended december  and revenues dollar amounts in thousands  except for arpu for the year ended december  of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  of consolidated revenues service and roaming revenues   equipment revenues   total revenues   arpu n a arpu does not include roaming revenues generated from the use by nextel subscribers on our portion of the nextel digital mobile network 
arpu is not calculated for december  due to the information not being comparable to the year ending december  cost of service revenues for the year ended december  our cost of service revenues was million compared to million for the same period in the increase for compared to was primarily due to twelve months of operational activities in compared to initial operating expenses for upstate new york and hawaii that launched in july and september  respectively

as a result  the difference between equipment revenues and cost of equipment revenues was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to employ these discounts and promotions in an effort to grow our number of subscribers 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we expect that cost of equipment revenues will exceed our equipment revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses the year ended december  was a transition period during which nextel wip made certain accounting  payroll  customer care  purchasing  human resources  information technology and billing functions available to us 
for the year ended december  we paid nextel wip approximately million for these services 
in late october  our customer care center began operations and at the end of  we had transferred a majority of these services to our employees and systems 
for the year ended december   our selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million for the same period in of the total million for the year ended december   million pertained to our hawaii and upstate new york markets 
the remaining amount reflects the costs to hire and set up functional departments and offices in addition to increasing the sales and marketing activities for new market launches 
the million increase in expenses for the hawaii and upstate new york markets for the same period reflects the growth in sales and marketing activities to build the subscriber count

this represents an increase of million from our loss of million for the same period in expenses increased in all categories as we have added subscriber usage to the network  hired staff  set up functional departments and offices  and increased marketing and sales activities for new launch markets 
we anticipate reporting net losses for the foreseeable future as we grow and expand to meet the requirements of the business 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs arise from the capital requirements necessary to complete the build out of our portion of the nextel digital mobile network  including the future acquisitions of additional frequencies and the introduction of new services 
we expect capital expenditures to include  among other things  switches  base radios  transmission towers  antennae  radio frequency engineering  cell site construction and additional fcc licenses 
currently  we estimate that capital requirements to build out our portion of the nextel digital mobile network  including build out of the markets we acquired from nextel wip on september   and operating losses and working capital for the period from inception through the end of  will total approximately billion  including the in kind contributions we have received or expect to receive from nextel wip and motorola 
for the year ended december   we used million in cash for operating activities  compared to million for the same period in the increased use of funds for operating activities in was primarily due to expenses relating to hiring employees  setting up functional departments and offices  network operating costs for additional sites placed in service  increased marketing and sales activities along with purchasing subscriber inventory and an increase in receivables due to additional customers

the remaining commitments will be paid in september our senior discount notes due february  were sold in january the notes were issued at a discount to their aggregate principal amount at maturity and generated aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
in july we exchanged these notes for registered notes having the same financial terms and covenants as the notes issued in january cash interest will not accrue on the notes prior to february  on april   we redeemed of the accreted value of these outstanding notes for approximately million with proceeds from our initial public offering 
the redemption payment of million included million of these outstanding notes plus a premium of approximately million 
the notes still outstanding will accrete in value representing the amortization of original issue discount at a rate of  compounded semiannually  to an aggregate principal amount of million by february  as of december   the accreted value of the outstanding senior discount notes was approximately million 
nextel partners operating corp  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  entered into a credit facility in january with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by donaldson  lufkin jenrette securities corporation  as arranger  dlj capital funding  as syndication agent  and bank of montreal  as administrative agent 
this credit facility was amended and restated in september the credit facility  as amended  includes a million term loan  a million term loan and a million reducing revolving credit facility 
subject to nextel partners operating corp 
s right in the future to seek an increase of up to million  the credit facility may not exceed million 
the million term loan matures on january   and the million term loan matures on july  the revolving credit facility will terminate on january  on january   nextel partners operating corp 
borrowed the full amount of the million term loan  and on september   it borrowed the full amount of the million term loan 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the million revolving credit facility 
the million and the million term loans both bear interest  at our option  at the administrative agent s alternate base rate or reserve adjusted libor plus  in each case  applicable margins 
the applicable margin for the million term loan is over libor and over the base rate of the higher of per annum above the latest federal funds rate or the prime rate 
the applicable margin for the million term loan is over libor and over the base rate 
for the revolving credit facility  the initial applicable margin is over libor and over the base rate until consolidated ebitda  as adjusted  is positive  at which time the applicable margin will be initially over libor and over the base rate and thereafter will be determined on the basis of the ratio of total debt to annualized ebitda  as adjusted  and will range between and over libor and between and over the base rate 
borrowings under the term loans are secured by a first priority pledge of all assets of our subsidiaries and a pledge of their capital stock 
the credit facility contains financial and other covenants customary for the wireless industry 
the credit facility also contains covenants requiring the maintenance of certain defined financial ratios and meeting operational targets including service revenues  subscriber units and network coverage 
as of december  we were in compliance with all covenants associated with this credit facility 
on march   we issued million of senior notes due  and on july   we issued an additional million of senior notes  each in a private placement 
we subsequently exchanged all of the march and july notes for registered notes having the same financial terms and covenants 
interest will accrue for these notes at the rate of per annum  payable semiannually in cash in arrears on march and september of each year  which commenced on september  while we believe we have sufficient funds to complete the build out of our existing markets  acquire additional frequencies and provide us with the working capital necessary to cover our debt service requirements and operating losses through  which is when we anticipate achieving positive operating cash flow for the full fiscal year  we cannot assure you that additional funding will not be necessary 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balance was approximately million 
we could require additional financing to complete our existing portion of the nextel digital mobile network  to acquire additional fcc licenses  to add capacity and to offer additional services  and such additional financing might be expensive or impossible to obtain 
option territories under our agreements with nextel wip  we had the right  but not the obligation  to elect to build out additional markets 
on july   we exercised part of this option to acquire frequencies in markets where over million people live and work and closed the transaction on september  these markets are in the following states idaho  iowa  kansas  kentucky  minnesota  nebraska  new york  north dakota  texas  vermont  virginia  west virginia and wisconsin 
in november  we completed the application for transfer of control for these licenses and anticipate fcc approval for the transfer of the smr licenses covering these territories from nextel wip to us 
our option to acquire any additional markets has expired 
we must build out all but one of these optioned markets by the end of we are not required to build out one of the markets until when we build out the optioned territory we must comply with the same launch criteria applicable in the rest of our markets 
in addition  we have the right to purchase from nextel wip all related fixed network equipment and operational contracts existing  held or used by nextel in such territories 
equipment and operating agreements we have entered into agreements with motorola to purchase necessary infrastructure equipment and other related software and services we use as well as subscriber wireless telephones and other accessories 
in addition  in connection with the capitalization transactions  motorola contributed to us a total of million credit against future purchases in exchange for shares of our preferred stock 
as of december  we had fully utilized this credit 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
currently  our agreements with nextel wip allow us access to nextel s switches and switching facilities 
nextel wip has agreed to cooperate with us to establish a switch facility for our network and to deploy switches in our territory in a manner which best meets the following criteria integration of our cell sites into nextel s national switching infrastructure  shared coverage of nextel direct connect service to communities of interest  minimized costs to us and to nextel  and maximized quality of service to our customers and to nextel customers 
these criteria provide for a flexible construction schedule of switches to serve our territory  depending on the existing switches in nextel s territory and the amount of customer traffic handled by any one switch 
we have the option of installing our own switching facilities within our territory 
however  our deployment of any switching facility requires coordination with nextel wip and may require nextel wip s approval 
our agreements with nextel wip require us to implement and install appropriate switch elements as the number of our subscribers and cell site levels increases 
for example  we will need to install a mobile switching office for every  subscriber units or a base site controller for every operational cell sites 
we believe that we have sufficient funds on hand for these installations under our current business plans 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which  as amended by fasb no 
 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
the statements require that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if hedge accounting criteria are met the changes in a derivatives fair value for a cash flow hedge are deferred in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the hedge item and hedging instrument are settled 
the ineffective portions of hedge returns are recognized in earnings 
at december  the company s interest rate swap agreements had an estimated fair value of million 
sfas issued august postponed for one year the mandatory effective date for sfas to january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the prime rate which are used to determine the interest rate applicable to the term loans of our subsidiary under its credit facility 
in april and  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for million and million of these borrowings  respectively  to partially hedge our interest rate exposure 
interest rate swaps have the effect of converting the applicable variable rate obligations to fixed or other variable rate obligations 
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate of all our variable rate obligations would be approximately million 
in january  we issued our senior discount notes  and in each of march and july  we issued our senior notes 
while fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of these notes  interest expense will not be affected due to the fixed interest rate of these notes 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
