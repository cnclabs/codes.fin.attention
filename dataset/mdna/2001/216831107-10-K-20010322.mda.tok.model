item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations consolidated net sales in reached a record setting level of billion  an increase of billion  or percent  from levels 
the acquisitions of the standard products company standard on october  and siebe automotive siebe on january  accounted for approximately billion of the increase 
the sales increase in followed a million  or percent  increase in the company s sales in from the acquisition of standard added million to the company s total sales in operating profit was million in  nearly six percent higher than the million generated in this increase was attributable to the operating profit of standard and siebe  offset by the impacts in of restructuring costs  operating losses of closed or sold facilities  and additional goodwill amortization related to the acquisitions of standard and siebe 
the company recorded million million after tax

selling  general and administrative expenses were percent of net sales in  compared to percent in and percent in spending levels in reflect the higher general and administrative costs associated with the acquired operations 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in  reflecting the higher debt levels incurred with the acquisitions of standard and siebe 
interest expense in was million higher than in  reflecting the acquisition of standard 
other income increased from  in to million in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries which were part of the standard acquisition were responsible for this increase 
the most significant of these is nishikawa standard company  a partnership of which the company and nishikawa rubber co  ltd 
of japan each own percent 
the partnership  which has production facilities in indiana  manufactures automotive sealing components for automotive companies operating in the united states  including those based in japan 
during  other income of million reflected a gain resulting from the sale of a warehouse 
the effective income tax rate of percent in is higher than the percent in due to the impact of nondeductible goodwill attributable to the acquisitions of standard and siebe 
the lower rate of percent resulted from foreign tax benefits 
the company has recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated potential tax benefits which may not be realized  principally due to the inability of certain of the foreign subsidiaries acquired with standard and siebe to utilize available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
net operating loss carryforwards expire in years through the effects of inflation did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company in  and business segments the company has two reportable segments tire and automotive 
the company s reportable segments are each managed separately because they offer different products requiring different marketing and distribution strategies 
the tire segment produces automobile  truck and motorcycle tires and inner tubes which are sold nationally and internationally in the replacement tire market to independent dealers  wholesale distributors and large retail chains  and supplies equipment and materials to the truck tire retreading industry 
the automotive segment produces body sealing systems  active and passive vibration control systems nvh  and fluid handling systems primarily for the global automotive original equipment manufacturing and replacement markets 
tire segment overview sales of passenger car and light truck tire replacement units in the u 
s 
market increased by approximately percent over the increased replacement sales resulting from the well publicized august recall of certain firestone tires accounted for a significant percentage of this increase 
higher raw material costs impacted all of the tire producers  but attempts to obtain price increases to offset those higher costs were unsuccessful  due  at least until the firestone recall  to global overcapacity  excess inventories  and the increased presence of foreign producers exporting low priced tires to the u 
s 
market 
sales sales for the tire segment were billion in  an increase of million  or nearly percent  from the acquisition of oliver rubber company oliver as part of the standard acquisition contributed million of the increase 
tire unit sales  including both passenger and truck sizes  increased by five percent from passenger tire shipments increased more than one percent from light truck tire shipments increased more than percent  significantly outpacing the industry s four percent growth in this category in a strong emphasis on serving the light truck tire market with quality  leading edge products for all categories of the market  together with the introduction of significant new product offerings  accounted for the segment s excellent performance in the light truck tire market 
increased sales of the company s proprietary brand tires  and sales arising from the firestone recall  contributed to the sales increase in a price increase announced in october  to become 
table of contents effective on january   was a factor in an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of  as customers made purchases in advance of the price increase 
the adverse impacts of low priced tire imports and a large customer s shift away from the marketing of private brand tires partially offset those gains 
sales in at billion increased million or nearly eight percent from the acquisition of oliver in accounted for million of this increase 
increased sales to certain private brand customers and continued growth in cooper s proprietary brands contributed to the improvement  as did increasing demand for light truck tires 
growth in the company s tire shipments continued to outpace the replacement tire industry in but was limited by capacity constraints 
operating profit the tire segment recorded restructuring charges of nearly million during charges of million were recorded at the company s subsidiary in the united kingdom 
the remaining million resulted from the decision to close oliver facilities in wadsworth  ohio  export  pennsylvania  paris  texas  dallas  texas  and athens  georgia  where both a distribution facility and oliver s administrative headquarters will be closed early in the closings were due to excess capacity and a decision to more closely integrate oliver s operations with those of the company s tire business  rather than continue to operate oliver as a stand alone business 
operating profit increased four percent from million in to million in the majority of the increase was attributable to the inclusion of oliver s performance for a full year in operating margin was percent in  a decrease from percent in operating margin exclusive of the restructuring charges in was percent 
an increase in raw material costs of over million  due primarily to increases in the price of petroleum  was the principal reason for the decline in the segment s margins in improvements in product mix and pricing  due to a higher percentage of the segment s sales in consisting of higher margin proprietary brand tires  and due also to lower plant costs resulting from manufacturing efficiency initiatives  partially offset the impact of higher raw material costs 
in addition  a benefit was realized from the settlement of a tax dispute  allowing the reversal of a million reserve accrued in prior years 
exchange rates adversely impacted the segment s performance in the strength of the british pound versus the euro depressed exports to the european continent of tires produced by the company s subsidiary in the united kingdom 
the strong u 
s 
dollar adversely affected exports of tires produced in the united states and facilitated low priced imports into the united states 
over the past two years  the north american replacement tire industry has continued to experience intense competitive pricing due to global overcapacity  high inventory levels  increased sales of low priced tires from south america and asia and the strategic approaches of various competitors 
these factors prevented the segment from realizing price increases which were sought during to offset higher raw material costs 
as a result  the company s margins were adversely impacted 
however  inventory levels in the domestic replacement industry were significantly reduced in the latter months of  due in substantial part to the increased demand created by the firestone recall 
as a result  the segment  in october  announced price increases for its tire products effective january  operating profit in increased nearly percent over  from million to million 
operating margins were percent in  an improvement from percent in increased volume  favorable raw material costs and cost savings measures were the reasons for these improvements 
transition costs associated with the conversion of the texarkana plant to continuous operations  increases in selling  general and administrative expenses and the lower margins of the oliver business partially offset their impact 
outlook the year will be a challenging one for the tire segment 
as the demand for replacement tires created by the firestone recall abates  and as lower automobile production reduces the portion of tire manufacturing capacity which is devoted to producing original equipment tires  the overcapacity issue that has impacted the replacement tire industry in past years may reappear 
also  a decline in consumer confidence as economic conditions become increasingly uncertain could cause reductions in spending on replacement tires 
finally  overcapacity among tire producers in south america and asia  coupled with a continuation of the strength of the u 
s 
dollar  are likely to result in continued high levels of imports of low priced  lower end tires into the u 
s 
replacement market 
demand in the domestic replacement tire industry in is expected to remain at the same level as in  reflecting the loss of the demand created in by the firestone recall and a softening in the general economy 
the segment is  however  projecting an increase in its unit sales for the year 
improvements in the segment s profitability will depend on raw material costs  which are largely dependent on the price of petroleum  and its ability to obtain price increases sufficient to recover last year s increases in those costs and offset further increases that may occur this year 
the segment is cautiously optimistic that the price increase which became effective at the beginning of the year will be realized throughout the course of the year 
the company expects that opportunities for future sales growth will most likely be in its sales of proprietary brand tires to its independent dealers 
the segment s ability to offer a 
table of contents tier one brand tire to its dealers through its alliance with pirelli is expected to continue to enhance its performance in as that relationship continues to develop and strengthen 
while the performance of the segment s subsidiary in the united kingdom was disappointing last year  a strategic decision has been made to streamline the various product lines offered by the subsidiary and focus on a smaller number of premium tires 
the weakening of the pound versus the euro  and the strengthening of the euro versus the dollar  could also favorably impact the performance of the subsidiary in oliver and the rest of the commercial truck tire unit are facing a challenging year 
the heavy truck industry was severely impacted by higher fuel prices in  and the economics of that industry are likely to remain poor in in addition  oliver s largest customer terminated its agreement with the company effective december  the business will rely on the cost reductions to be realized from its restructuring  plus increased efforts to improve market share  to aid its performance in the company is also defending itself against numerous class action lawsuits involving its tires 
additional information about the lawsuits is included in the contingencies section of this management s discussion and analysis 
automotive segment overview the company s automotive segment serves automotive original equipment manufacturers all over the world 
the year was a year of record sales in the automotive industry 
production in north america reached million vehicles  which was the highest level ever recorded and an increase of one percent over levels 
production in europe was million vehicles versus million in production in brazil reached million  up from million vehicles in  when a currency crisis led to a severe economic contraction 
the share of the north american market held by the three us based automotive manufacturers  general motors  ford and the chrysler unit of daimlerchrysler  declined by approximately percentage points in from levels 
this decline has adversely impacted the segment  because a greater percentage of its north american sales in were to those three customers 
a significant part of the company s global strategy for its automotive business is to increase its level of sales to automotive manufacturers based outside of the united states 
notwithstanding the performance of the automotive industry for all of  production levels slowed significantly in north america in the fourth quarter of the year  especially among the us based automotive producers 
competitive product offerings from foreign based manufacturers  especially in the popular minivan and sport utility vehicle segments  accentuated the production decline of the us based automotive manufacturers 
automotive suppliers  such as the company  operate in an environment in which price reductions are generally expected by its customers on at least an annual basis 
emphasis on continuous improvement  lean manufacturing and other cost reduction initiatives are required to operate successfully in this environment 
sales sales for the automotive segment increased from million in to billion in the acquisitions of standard and siebe were responsible for the sales increase in this segment 
sales in were especially strong in north america due to record production levels in the industry 
approximately percent of the segment s sales in were in north america  percent in europe  and three percent in brazil and australia 
sales at the segment s four facilities in mexico increased significantly to million in  as programs awarded in earlier years  including sealing components for chrysler s pt cruiser  ramped up to full production during the year  and as the fluid systems unit completed the relocation of approximately percent of its production to mexico from other locations in north america 
although the segment does business with all of the world s automakers  approximately percent of its global sales are to ford  daimlerchrysler  and general motors 
sales of fluid systems benefited from the combining of the acquired siebe operations with those of the company s hose business  as the segment became able to offer pre assembled hose and tube modules to its customers 
nearly all of the segment s foreign sales were of body sealing components and fluid handling systems 
approximately percent of the total sales of each of these product lines were derived from foreign operations 
the relatively high concentration of european production in the united kingdom adversely impacted the sales of the segment s european operations due to the strength of the british pound during the year 
sales late in reflected the significant decline in north american vehicle production which occurred during the fourth quarter  as an unexpectedly rapid slowdown in vehicle sales took hold 
this slowdown left the automobile companies with high levels of 
table of contents inventory  which led to much lower production levels during the quarter 
daimlerchrysler  the segment s second largest customer  was especially hard hit by the slowdown  and the segment s sales to its chrysler unit declined substantially in the quarter 
automotive sales in increased percent from million in to million 
two months of sales from standard s automotive businesses  totaling million  were included in s sales 
other growth resulted from new contracts for nvh control systems on the gm silverado sierra pickup and sport utility vehicle  the new saturn ls sedan and the ford focus 
operating profit operating profit in was million  an increase of nearly ten percent over operating margins were four percent in  versus percent in the reduction in operating margin was due to several factors 
first  a restructuring charge of million was recorded in this charge related to a decision to close or downsize facilities in north america and europe 
in addition  an automotive sealing facility in kittanning  pennsylvania was closed during the year 
costs of million associated with that closing were accrued in the recording of the acquisition of standard 
second  the segment suffered several nonrecurring losses which impacted its operating margins during the closure of a sealing plant in france  where production ended in april  reduced operating profit by million 
losses resulting from production difficulties experienced at the segment s automotive plastics plant in winnsboro  south carolina  which was sold at the end of april  totaled million 
third  results from operations were especially weak in the sealing business in europe  where overcapacity  poor product pricing  and a significant presence in the united kingdom where the strong british pound hurt sales of products exported to other european countries plagued the segment s efforts to achieve profitability 
results in the fluid systems business in europe were profitable  but not in an amount sufficient to offset the losses experienced by the sealing business 
on the positive side  performance in benefited from north american fluid systems production in mexico  where the cost structure is significantly lower than in the united states 
prior to the company s acquisition of siebe in january  nearly all north american fluid systems production resided in the united states 
the performance of the north american sealing business in benefited from the greater raw material buying power that resulted from the ability to combine its purchasing with that of the company s tire business 
in addition  cost reductions achieved in brazil during the year enabled the segment to break even there in despite a continued sluggish economy 
operating profit in was million  an increase of more than percent over operating margins  however  declined from percent in to percent in this decline reflects the acquisition of standard  price reductions demanded by customers  product mix and the favorable impact in of a million recovery of previously expensed costs related to a dispute with a former owner of a plant site 
manufacturing efficiencies offset some of the adverse impact of price reductions 
outlook the downturn that impacted the domestic automotive industry in the fourth quarter of has continued in the first quarter of light vehicle production by general motors  ford  and the chrysler unit of daimlerchrysler in the first quarter of is expected to be approximately percent lower than in the same quarter last year  when production rates were at historically high levels 
while production levels are expected to improve over the remainder of the year as excess inventories are worked off  north american production will likely be at least five percent lower than in as a result  the segment s unit sales will likely decrease by a commensurate amount  and perhaps more  if the decline in the market share of the three us based auto companies that has occurred in each of the past two years continues in this is because a greater proportion of the segment s north american sales are to those companies than to foreign manufacturers producing vehicles in north america 
the segment also faces the challenge of further price reductions for its products 
in addition to previously negotiated price decreases that took effect at the beginning of the year  daimlerchrysler announced in late that it was unilaterally implementing five percent price decreases for all components supplied to it 
because approximately percent of the segment s north american sales are to daimlerchrysler  such a reduction would adversely impact the segment s results of operations 
negotiations are being conducted with daimlerchrysler with respect to those price decreases 
the outcome of those discussions  and their impact both on current contracts and on the segment s future relationship with daimlerchrysler  cannot presently be determined with any certainty 
the segment was awarded a large amount of incremental new business in  most of which will launch beginning in among the most significant of this new business are sealing systems for the ford f series truck  ford focus  and gm isuzu pickup truck 
the former represents a major penetration into the truck business at ford  while the latter two represent global platforms 
the company would not have been considered for this business but for the acquisitions of standard and siebe 

table of contents in  the segment s north american volume will be adversely impacted by the discontinuance of several programs  and by reduced volumes on other vehicles 
new business commencing in will not be sufficient to offset this volume decline 
the closure of four production plants in north america as part of the segment s restructuring plan will significantly reduce the segment s cost structure  and is intended to position the segment for improved profitability in the future 
successful implementation of the restructuring plan in a timely fashion is essential to the segment s ability to meet its performance targets for in europe  the segment is aggressively integrating its sealing and fluid systems businesses under one administrative structure  to create efficiencies and eliminate duplicative overhead 
this integration will also better enable both the sealing and fluid systems businesses to establish a presence in all parts of europe  where each previously had a greater presence in some european countries than in others 
within the european sealing systems business  the creation of one administrative structure will also eliminate duplicative administrative and technical functions that previously existed in the united kingdom and france 
in addition  the segment will increase its manufacturing presence in poland and the czech republic  to avail itself of the lower cost structure that exists in those countries 
these actions  which constitute a significant part of the segment s restructuring plan  will substantially reduce the break even point of the european operations  which are projected to be profitable in at currently expected volumes 
the brazilian sealing operation will also report under the european administrative structure  thus better integrating operations in that country into the european business  which deals directly with the units of the automotive customers which have responsibility for many aspects of brazilian operations 
substantial cost reductions were made in brazil in  including the commencement of the integration of the separate siebe and standard operations there 
given expected economic conditions and current sales levels  the segment believes it will be profitable in brazil in company summary the company will not be content in merely to weather the potential economic downturn through cost reduction efforts  although timely implementation of its restructuring plan and a continued emphasis on new manufacturing initiatives and other efforts to create operating efficiencies are critical to the continued success of its businesses 
the company will continue to seek opportunities to further develop both of its business segments 
the tire segment will seek opportunities  most likely through strategic alliances with foreign companies  to obtain low cost production capabilities that will enhance its ability to compete at the lower end of the replacement tire market 
the automotive segment intends to further strengthen its global operations through alliances with foreign partners  including nishikawa rubber co  ltd 
of japan and jin young standard inc of korea  in the body sealing unit and the contitech unit of continental ag in the nvh unit 
the segment will also continue to expand upon the opportunities created by the combining of the company s hose and siebe s fluid systems businesses to provide value added modular components to its customers 
the company has agreed to invest million in rubbernetwork

the company does not believe any liability it may have for these matters will be material to its results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the company has been named in separate class action lawsuits filed against it in separate state courts  plus the commonwealth of puerto rico 
one lawsuit purports to represent a national class  while in two others  the proposed class character has been voluntarily withdrawn by amendment 
the lawsuits  all of which have been filed under the auspices of the same group of plaintiffs attorneys  assert claims under the respective states consumer protection and deceptive trade practices statutes  and comparable commercial law and other theories 
they allege that the company used certain materials and procedures in its process of manufacturing steel belted radial tires which rendered an unspecified percentage of the tires unsafe  and failed to disclose those practices to purchasers of its tires 
the suits are brought on behalf of all persons excluding those who have sustained personal injury and or property damage as a result of the alleged unlawful practices in the respective states who purchased steel belted radial tires manufactured by the company from to the present  and still retain those tires 
the lawsuits generally seek  on behalf of each class member  relief sufficient to secure replacement of their tires  statutory  compensatory and punitive damages  and costs and attorneys fees
