item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our operations have continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design modifications  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
termination of manufacturing relationships or changes  reductions or delays in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  as has occurred in the past 
our results also depend to a substantial extent on the success of our oem customers in marketing their products 
we continue to seek to diversify our customer base to reduce our reliance on our few major customers 
see business strategy and customers under item  business 
the industry segments we serve  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
discontinuance or modification of products containing components manufactured by the company could adversely affect our results of operations 
the electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a general recession in the electronics industry as we have experienced in the first quarter of  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we typically do not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from our customers  but rather we work with our customers to anticipate future volumes of orders 
based upon such anticipated future orders  we will make commitments regarding the level of business we want and can accomplish the timing of production schedules and the levels of and utilization of facilities and personnel 
occasionally  we purchase raw materials without a customer order or commitment 
customers may cancel  delay or reduce orders  usually without penalty  for a variety of reasons  whether relating to the customer or the industry in general  which orders are already made or anticipated 
any significant cancellations  reductions or order delays could adversely affect our results of operations 
we use erp techniques through our visual manufacturing system see item  business business strategy in our efforts to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements 
we are dependent on the timely availability of many components 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for six months of there was a worldwide shortage of key electronic components  which adversely impacted our sales and earnings 
it is important for us to efficiently manage inventory  proper timing of expenditures and allocations of physical and personnel resources in anticipation of future sales  the evaluation of economic conditions in the electronics industry and the mix of products  whether pcbs  wire harnesses  cables  or turnkey products  for manufacture 
see electronic manufacturing industry and supplies and materials management under item  business and results of operations below 
we must continuously develop improved manufacturing procedures to accommodate our customers needs for increasingly complex products 
to continue to grow and be a successful competitor  we must be able to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by our customers  there can be no assurance that our process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render our technology  equipment or processes obsolete or uncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that we determine that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment 
during periods of recession in the electronics industry  as we have experienced in the first quarter of  our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronic oems  who may become more price sensitive 
our results of operations are also affected by other factors  including price competition  the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs due to availability  the overhead efficiencies achieved by management in managing the costs of our operations  our experience in manufacturing a particular product  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased orders  selling  and general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins during periods of lower volume production 
we compete with much larger electronic manufacturing entities for expansion opportunities 
any acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and other costs and expenses  all of which could materially adversely affect our financial results 
acquisition transactions also involve numerous business risks  including difficulties in successfully integrating the acquired operations  technologies and products or formalizing anticipated synergies  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns

new accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires  among other things  that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and that these instruments be measured at fair value 
we are in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of fas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
due to the company s limited use of derivative financial instruments  the adoption of fas is not expected to have a significant effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
we attempt to pass on increased costs and expenses by increasing selling prices when and where possible and by developing different and improved products for our customers that can be sold at targeted profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities and interest bearing accounts at financial institutions in which we had approximately  invested at december  interest rate risks on debt is managed by negotiation of appropriate rates on new financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt agreements which totaled approximately  at december  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on our year end investments would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our results of operations 
a increase in rates on our year end variable rate debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our results of operations 
our exposure to market risks from foreign currency exchange rates relates to our european subsidiary whose results of operations when translated into us dollars are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
a strengthening of the us dollar against the local scottish currency  the pound  would have negatively impacted earnings by approximately  we have not incurred any significant realized losses on exchange transactions and does not utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses
