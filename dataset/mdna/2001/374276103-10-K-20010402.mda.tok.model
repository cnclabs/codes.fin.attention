these actions and related costs were determined not to be within the scope of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  as they were not incurred as a direct result of the formal restructuring plans identified above 
as such  these costs were expensed as incurred and were included on the integration costs line of the consolidated statements of operations 
subsequent to the vcg acquisition in  management determined that further integration of the company s operations and facilities was necessary to eliminate duplicate facilities and combined functions and to take advantage of opportunities for further leveraging cost and technology platforms 
actions included the termination of approximately employees  the review of processes and resultant actions to implement processes that would benefit the fully integrated company going forward  abandonment of sales facilities  consulting and other professional assistance in determining what functions and facilities were needed  and contract re negotiations and terminations 
these actions and related million in costs were also determined not to be within the scope of eitf  as they were not incurred as a direct result of a formal restructuring plan 
as such  these costs were expensed as incurred and were included on the integration costs line of the consolidated statements of operations 
additional employee terminations are expected to take place through the end of the second quarter of in connection with this integration 
a summary of integration costs and how they impacted the company s consolidated results of operations is as follows in thousands years ended december  employee termination costs  facilities exit costs  process integration costs    consulting and professional fees   contract re negotiation termination costs   other debt conversion expense in  we incurred debt conversion expense of million related to premiums paid when we induced the early retirement of approximately million of our then outstanding million of convertible subordinated notes due extraordinary items in january  a subsidiary of the company retired million of debt at a discount prior to maturity 
this resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  net of income taxes of million  or per share 
in may  the company completed the issuance of million  convertible subordinated notes due a portion of the proceeds was used to repay million of term debt  due to hsbc bank plc formerly midland bank plc  prior to maturity 
this early repayment resulted in an extraordinary charge of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  or per share  resulting principally from the write off of unamortized loan costs 
results of operations the company recognized a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december   as compared to net losses of million or per share in and million or per share in excluding the effects of extraordinary items discussed above  the company recognized net losses of million or per share for and million or per share for there were no extraordinary items recorded in below are selected financial highlights of the company s results of operations for the years shown years ended december  of sales of sales of sales in thousands  except percentages statement of operations data sales    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expense    amortization of intangibles and depreciation    interest expense  net    income tax expense benefit    net loss    other operating data ebitda    results of operations compared to results of operations sales consolidated sales of million for grew million or over sales of million in this growth was experienced mainly in sales to customers in north america and europe  which increased million or and million or  respectively 
sales growth in was realized across all brands  particularly vcg  stone  tib stills and film  which grew million  million  million and million  respectively 
sales in vcg  tib stills and film increased mainly due to significantly lower or no sales in the prior year due to acquisition of these companies late in or in stone  a worldwide provider of contemporary stock photography  experienced organic growth due mainly to increased customer usage of e commerce as a means of selecting and taking delivery of images 
the increase in stone revenues was primarily volume based but does reflect the effects of price increases 
gross profit and gross margin the company s gross profit and gross margin were million and  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to gross profit and gross margin of million and  respectively  for the same period in the decrease in gross margin in the current year was due to lower gross margins at vcg  acquired in march   and at art 
com 
the decrease was partially offset by increases resulting from a continuing sales mix shift to web based sales and a higher sales mix of wholly owned imagery 
as stated above  management is taking action to improve the cost structure of art 
com and evaluating strategic alternatives for its future  including a potential sale 
as such  management does not expect gross margins going forward to decline further as a result of these negative factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of sales in  as compared to million or of sales in the majority of the dollar increase was due to the inclusion of tib uk  vcg and tib in the consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisition 
additional contributing factors included advertising and marketing expenses associated with new websites  increased investment in management and new sales offices  and costs associated with the development of new technology products and new business systems  particularly those related to e commerce  that were not capitalized 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales over the same period due to operational efficiencies gained through our restructuring and integration efforts 
during  we closed offices and eliminated over positions 
the company is committed to managing its selling  general and administrative expenses as it continues to integrate and consolidate its businesses and implement new and standardized business systems 
as customers increasingly move towards digital image search  retrieval and payment  we plan to streamline our support operations 
we are also consolidating our offices and other premises throughout the world as part of the integration of our existing and acquired businesses 
as such  management does not expect organic selling  general and administrative expenses to grow substantially over the next year 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the company  ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  as well as exchange gains losses  loss on impairment of long lived assets  debt conversion expenses  integration and restructuring costs  extraordinary items and other income and expenses  when applicable 
this figure can more easily be calculated as gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses in the years presented 
the company believes that ebitda provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating income unaffected by the financing and accounting effects of acquisitions and assists in explaining trends in its operating performance 
ebitda should not  however  be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity 
ebitda for was million or of sales  an increase of over ebitda of million or of sales for our continued drive to integrate our businesses resulted in a significant increase in the ebitda margin in  as selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation amortization of intangibles increased to million in from million in due to the inclusion of intangible assets arising from additional acquisitions 
the amortization of intangibles will result in substantial charges against our earnings in future periods  including approximately million and million in and  respectively  based on unamortized balances at december  any additional acquisitions involving intangibles could materially increase these amounts 
depreciation expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily related to business acquisitions in and  together with increased capital expenditures related to the continued development of technology assets related to our web based sales strategy and an increase in our capitalized costs of image digitization 
we expect depreciation expense in and beyond to continue to increase as a result of these increased investments 
net interest expense net interest expense totaled million in and million in we incurred interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  on increased long term borrowings 
this interest expense was offset in part by interest income of million and million earned on our invested cash and cash equivalents in and  respectively 
income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of million in as compared to a benefit of million in excluding the effect of the amortization of intangibles  debt conversion expense and the loss on impairment of long lived assets  which are largely non tax deductible  the company s effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate were due to variations in the profit mix and tax rates in the countries in which we operated  as well as the effect of debt conversion costs and loss on impairment of long lived assets that were not fully tax deductible 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets of million 
although realization is not assured  management believes  based on its current expectations and tax planning strategies  that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
results of operations compared to results of operations sales our total sales for and were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of in over the prior year 
the increase was largely attributable to the continued growth of our base businesses  acquisitions we acquired photodisc and allsport in february  art 
com in may  eyewire in august and tib in november and growth in e commerce sales 
we experienced an increase in the rate of demand for both analog and digital  search  selection and fulfillment of imagery during  particularly in north america 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  increased sequentially from in to in this result reflects the increasing shift in sales mix to e commerce with its lower cost of sales  as well as continuing changes in our sales mix at the brand level 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively  representing and of sales in each respective year 
the principal factors contributing to increases in the dollar amounts of selling  general and administrative expenses during were the inclusion of acquisitions in our consolidated financial results allsport and photodisc from february  art 
com from may  eyewire from august and tib from november  accelerated investment in advertising and marketing costs associated with the new websites  increased investment in management and new sales offices  and the development of new technology products and new business systems  particularly those related to e commerce  that were not capitalized 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda for and was million and million  respectively  representing a decrease of in from the prior year 
the slight decline in ebitda in was primarily attributable to our investment in art 
com and american royal arts 
our ebitda in  excluding art 
com and american royal arts  was positively impacted by our overall growth  including growth through acquisitions  the growth in e commerce sales  the increasing sales mix of wholly owned imagery  as well as operating efficiencies 
ebitda as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in amortization of intangibles and depreciation amortization of intangibles was million in and million in the increase in amortization arose from the inclusion of amortization of goodwill relating to the acquisitions of photodisc and allsport in february  art 
com in may  eyewire in august and tib in november depreciation increased from million in to million in the increase primarily arose from acquisitions together with increased investment in capital expenditures related to the continued development of our e commerce strategy 
income taxes our income tax expense was million as compared to a tax benefit of million in excluding the effect of the amortization of intangibles  which is largely non tax deductible  we had an effective tax rate of in and in the changes in the effective rate of tax  excluding the impact of the amortization of intangibles  were due to variations in the profit mix and tax rates in the countries in which we operated and integration and restructuring costs  which were not all fully tax deductible 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources at december   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents  as well as bank credit facilities totaling million  of which million was unused 
at december   the company s working capital was million  a decrease of million from working capital of million at the end of current assets decreased million during  with decreases in cash and cash equivalents  offset in part by increases in other current assets 
current liabilities increased million during  with the current portion of long term debt decreasing and other current liabilities increasing 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during significant uses of cash included million for business acquisitions  million in capital expenditures  million in the repayment of long term debt  and approximately million in interest payments 
significant cash inflows included million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and million in cash provided by operating activities 
management expects capital expenditures to approximate million in and million in debt repayments on currently outstanding debt will be insignificant until the company s bank loans become due in  contributing to total long term debt repayment in that year of approximately million 
interest payments  based on the borrowings outstanding as of december   are expected to approximate million in existing cash balances and cash flows provided by operating activities and borrowing capacity are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and long term debt requirements for at least the following months 
however  we continue to seek opportunities to grow both organically and by acquisition 
accordingly  we may be required  or we may elect  to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings in addition to the sources mentioned above to finance acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  subsequently amended by sfas no 
and no 
 and required to be adopted for years beginning after june  this statement will require recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company will adopt the statement effective january  and does not anticipate that the adoption will have a significant effect on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  was adopted in the fourth quarter of implementation of this sab had no effect on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt instruments  the majority of which are fixed rate borrowings 
the book value and respective fair values are shown in the table below maturities fair value fair value december  december  debt total in thousands except percentages fixed rate usd      average interest rate variable rate usd     average interest rate other borrowings  average interest rate foreign currency risk we conduct our business primarily in the united states and europe  with cash flows primarily denominated in us dollars  euros and pounds sterling 
for non us subsidiaries  the local currency is considered the functional currency 
for reporting purposes  assets and liabilities are translated upon consolidation into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date  while revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average monthly exchange rates 
the effect of the translation of net assets are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to foreign currency denominated transactions and the related assets and liabilities 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  including those that arise from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated balances  are included in the results of operations for the period in which the exchange rate changes 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  namely forward foreign currency exchange contracts  to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks where natural hedging strategies cannot be effectively employed 
the company s forward exchange contracts have generally ranged from one to six months in original maturity 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the purpose of the company s hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in general  the company s derivative activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the company to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance 
however  the company has entered into these instruments with creditworthy financial institutions and considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are identified as and are effective as hedges of existing assets and liabilities are recognized in exchange gains losses  net on the consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the exchange rate changes 
if an underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in operations in the same period 
the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts or deferred gains or losses as of december  the introduction of the euro does not significantly affect our foreign exchange exposure
