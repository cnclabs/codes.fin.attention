item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  which was the only state it produced business in prior to the company expanded its operations into georgia and illinois in with the acquisition of american fidelity insurance group afi in december  now american mercury insurance group ami  the company expanded into the states of oklahoma and texas 
the company further expanded its operations into the state of florida during further expansion into texas occurred with the concord insurance services  inc transaction in december and the mercury county mutual insurance company mcm transaction in september during  approximately of the company s direct premiums written were derived from california 
in california  as in various other states  all property and casualty rates must be approved by the insurance commissioner before they can be used 
in february  the california insurance commissioner approved new rates which were designed to improve the company s competitive position for new insureds 
these rate changes  which became effective on may   provided for decreases in premium rates for new insureds 
several rate modifications were approved and made effective subsequent to may  a rate change made april   reduced rates by approximately and was primarily made to improve mercury s competitive position in the marketplace 
except for the april  rate change  the rate changes made over the last several years have been substantially revenue neutral 
the rate change made effective may  resulted in a substantial increase in new business being submitted to the company 
since march   private passenger automobile ppa policies in force in california have increased from approximately  to  at december   an annual rate of increase of approximately 
policy count growth for the year was down negligibly from reflecting increased competition in the marketplace 
in september  the california insurance commissioner issued new permanent rating factor regulations designed to implement the requirements that automobile insurance rates be determined by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and whatever optional factors are determined by the insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the law further requires that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
the company submitted a proposed rating plan in response to these regulations in march the company s plan was approved by the california doi and became effective october  although the rate changes produced some minor dislocations  implementation of the new plan has not materially changed the company s overall competitive position or its profitability 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased and net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts recorded in contributing to the overall premium written growth were initial automobile premiums in texas from the recent concord agency transaction  and increases in california homeowner premiums  california non standard automobile premiums and florida automobile premiums 
the company s core california private passenger automobile premiums were relatively flat and ami experienced a decline in premium volume 
the company believes that downward pressure on premium rates due to highly competitive conditions in the california private passenger auto market has resulted in higher loss ratios 
to improve loss ratios many california auto insurers have either filed for rate increases recently or will do so in the immediate future 
the company has filed for a rate increase in both its non standard automobile line and its private passenger automobile line written by mercury casualty company in california 
the combined premium volume for these two lines was million in representing approximately of the california private passenger business written in despite the proposed increase  the company believes that its rates will remain among the lowest in the market 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company feels that its marketing effort combined with price and reputation for service make the company very competitive in california 
the gaap loss ratio loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was in and in the major reason for the less favorable result is an increase in severity for california automobile claims which is the result of inflationary trends in health care costs  auto parts and body shop labor costs 
the gaap expense ratio in policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the decrease was due mainly to a reduction in base and contingent commissions  which are tied to loss performance  partially offset by an increase in advertising spending 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were  million  resulting in an underwriting gain premiums earned less losses  policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses for the period of million compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in was million compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of  million cost basis was  compared with on average investments of  million in the effective tax rate on investment income in was  compared with in the higher tax rate in reflects a modest shift in the company s portfolio mix from non taxable to taxable issues

included in losses was a million write down of a preferred stock investment that became other than temporarily impaired during the third quarter 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective rate of  compared with an effective rate of in the lower rate in is primarily attributable to the increased proportion of investment income which consists primarily of tax exempt interest and tax sheltered dividend income in contrast to underwriting income which is taxed at the full corporate rate of 
net income in was million or per share diluted  compared with or per share diluted  in diluted per share results are based on million average shares in and million shares in basic per share results were in and in year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased and net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts recorded in these premium increases were principally attributable to larger florida private passenger automobile insurance volume  premiums from the california non standard automobile policy introduced in late and sales of california homeowners insurance 
the company s core california private passenger automobile insurance lines achieved only modest premium growth  entirely attributable to a larger policy count  and ami experienced a decline in its premium volume 
the california private passenger automobile insurance marketplace continued to be extremely competitive which has placed downward pressure on rates 
in april  the company reduced its average premium rate by 
since was the first full year with the rate decrease in effect  average rates were lower than average rates 
the company has continued to increase its marketing efforts for both name recognition and lead generation purposes 
total amounts spent on advertising efforts during exceeded expenditures by approximately 
the gaap loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the less favorable loss ratio is primarily related to the rate decrease taken in april which had its full impact on the company s results in the gaap expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was in and in the increase in the expense ratio was primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with the advertising program that were partially offset by decreased profit related bonuses to agents 
total losses and expenses in  excluding interest expense of million  were  million  resulting in an underwriting gain for the period of million  compared with an underwriting gain of million in investment income in was million  compared with million in the after tax yield on average investments of  million cost basis was  compared with on average investments of  in the effective tax rate on investment income was in  compared to in the higher tax rate in reflects a modest shift in the mix of the company s equity investments from non taxable to taxable issues 
the redemption of bonds acquired during higher interest periods has been a negative influence on realized yields in each of the last several years 
bonds matured and called in totaled million  compared to million in realized investment losses in were million  compared with realized losses of million in included in realized losses for is a million write down of a preferred stock investment that became other than temporarily impaired during the third quarter of the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of  compared with an effective rate of in the lower rate in is primarily attributable to the increased proportion of investment income which consists primarily of tax exempt interest and tax sheltered dividend income in contrast to underwriting income  which is taxed at the full corporate rate of 
net income in was million or per share diluted  compared with million or per share diluted  in diluted per share results are based on million average shares in and million shares in basic per share results were in and in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided from operating activities in  was million  while funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of investments was million  of which approximately was represented by the sale of fixed maturities 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity investments increased by million during the year 
equity investments  including perpetual preferred stocks  increased by million at cost  while short term cash investments decreased by million 
the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale that were sold  called or matured during the year was million 
the market value of all investments held at market as available for sale exceeded the amortized cost of  million at december  by million 
that unrealized gain  reflected in shareholders equity  as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable tax effects  was million at december  compared with an unrealized loss of million at december  the increase in market values since december  reflects principally the substantial decrease in intermediate and long term interest rates during the company s unrestricted cash and short term investments totaled million at december  together with funds generated internally  such liquid assets are more than adequate to pay claims without the sale of long term investments 
as of december   the average rating of the  million bond portfolio at amortized cost was aa  while the average effective maturity  giving effect to anticipated early call provisions  approximates years 
the modified duration of the bond portfolio at year end was years 
duration measures the length of time it takes to receive all cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest income 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically and by obligor 
traditionally  it has been the company s policy not to invest in high yield or junk bonds 
at december  bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million  or less than of total assets 
fixed maturity investments of  million amortized cost  include million amortized cost of sinking fund preferred stocks  principally utility issues 
the market value of all fixed maturities exceeded cost by million at december  except for company occupied buildings  the company has no direct investments in real estate and no holdings of mortgages secured by commercial real estate 
equity holdings of million at market cost million  including perpetual preferred issues  are largely confined to the public utility and banking sectors and represent about of total shareholders equity 
the company had outstanding debt at december  of million 
of this amount  million has been borrowed under a three year revolving credit bank loan and is due november  the loan agreement requires the company to meet numerous affirmative and negative covenants 
the proceeds of the loan were used to repay a prior loan and to acquire ami  with the balance contributed as capital to ami 
the loan agreement may be extended annually for additional periods of one year each to maintain the three year maturity date 
due to an increase in interest rate spreads in the loan syndication market during and  the company did not extend the maturity for an additional one year period 
the company will reevaluate refinancing or extending the current maturity date of this loan during the interest rate is variable and is optionally related to the federal funds rate  bank of new york rate prime rate or the eurodollar london interbank rate libor 
based on rates effective at december   the net interest cost on the loan approximates 
the company also maintains a million line of credit  of which million was drawn at december  and is due october  the line of credit may be used to fund the company s stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in august as well as for general corporate purposes 
the interest rate is variable and is optionally related to the federal funds rate or the eurodollar london interbank rate libor 
based on rates effective at december   the net interest cost on the loan approximates 
the loan covenants are similar to the company s million loan discussed above 
the company regularly evaluates repayment and refinancing for its outstanding debt  including the amounts outstanding under its million loan and the million line of credit that become due and payable in as part of the elm county mutual transaction the company agreed to make annual million payments to employers reinsurance corporation over years beginning september  at december   the company is carrying a note payable for million  which represents the discounted value of the seven annual payments using a rate 
an additional  note payable to employers reinsurance corporation is due during the first quarter of and represents the remainder of the initial purchase price 
under the stock repurchase program  the company may purchase over a one year period up to million of mercury general s common stock 
the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at the discretion of management 
the program will be funded by the sale of lower yielding tax exempt bonds  the proceeds of the million credit facility and internal cash generation 
during  the company purchased  shares of the common stock in the open market at an average price of 
since the inception of the program in through december   the company has purchased  shares of common stock at an average price of 
the shares purchased were retired 
in march  the company s employee stock ownership plan the plan purchased  shares of mercury general s common stock in the open market at a price of per share  adjusted for the two for one stock split effective september  the purchases were funded by a five year term bank loan of million to the plan which is guaranteed by the company 
the shares have been allocated to employees over the amortization period of the loan  with the initial allocation made in december the remaining balance of the loan of million was retired in march with the proceeds of contributions to the plan by the company for the year  and the remaining unallocated shares were credited to employees esop balances at december  in august  the plan purchased  shares of mercury general s common stock in the open market at a price of per share 
the purchases were funded by a five year term bank loan of million to the plan which is guaranteed by the company 
the shares are being allocated to the employees over a five year period  with the initial allocation made in december since dividends on unallocated shares held by the plan are tax deductible if they are used for debt service  as are company contributions to the plan  the net  after tax interest cost to the company for the borrowed funds used for the plan stock purchase is less than the effective rate of interest on the loan  which  in  was 
in december  the naic adopted a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements for casualty companies 
the formula has been designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has estimated the risk based capital requirements of each of its insurance subsidiaries as of december  each of the companies policyholders surplus exceeded the highest level of minimum required capital 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the california earthquake authority cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established in to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
during the second quarter of  the company began placing all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowners policy through the california earthquake authority 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most current information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at april  is approximately million 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all of the insurance companies of million at december   and net written premiums for the twelve months ended on that date of  million  the ratio of writings to surplus was approximately to statement of financial accounting standards no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities  consisting primarily of preferred stocks  account for of total investments at market 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily us treasury backed overnight repurchase agreements and short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s investment philosophy has resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
during  interest rates declined  which increased the value of the company s fixed income investments  resulting in a total pretax unrealized gain of million on the fixed maturity holdings 
during  lower market interest reduced the duration of the company s bond portfolio 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
consequently  the average modified duration of the portfolio declined from years at december  to years at december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
at december   the company s strategy for equity investments is a buy and hold strategy which focuses primarily on current income with a secondary focus on capital appreciation 
the value of the equity investments consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to u 
s 
treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 
during most of the year  non sinking fund preferred stocks were not actively traded by the market  though lower interest rates intrinsically benefit their market values 
at december   the duration on the company s non sinking fund preferred stock portfolio was years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value at december  by approximately million  everything else remaining the same 
the remainder of the equity portfolio  representing of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility common stocks 
these assets are defensive in nature and therefore have low volatility to changes in market price as measured by their beta 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion contains forward looking statements regarding the company  its business  prospects and results of operations that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by factors and events that could cause the company s actual business  prospects and results of operations to differ materially from the historical information contained herein and from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  among others  the intense competition currently existing in the california automobile insurance markets  the success of the company in integrating and profitably operating the business of ami  and in expanding generally in florida and other states outside of california  the impact of potential third party bad faith legislation  the ability of the company to obtain the approval of the california insurance commissioner for premium rate changes for private passenger automobile policies issued in california and to obtain similar rate approvals in other states and the level of investment yields obtainable in the company s investment portfolio in comparison to recent yields  as well as the cyclical and general competitive nature of the property and casualty insurance industry and general uncertainties regarding loss reserve estimates and legislative and regulatory changes  particularly in california
