overview healthgate provides content solutions to hospitals  healthcare institutions  corporations and web sites  by leveraging web technology to supply up to date  comprehensive content that is reliable  objective and credible for physicians and other healthcare professionals  patients and health conscious consumers 
healthgate distributes its content through affiliated web sites such as the company s choice web sites for hospitals and other institutions  other third party co branded web sites and certain sections of the health channel of the nbci web site 
healthgate s management believes it has developed a scalable and sustainable business model 
the company s limited operating history makes an evaluation of the business and its prospects difficult 
investors should not use the company s past results as a basis to predict future performance 
healthgate has incurred net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  the company intends to continue to develop new content 
the company plans to manage its expenses in line with its revenue growth 
however  healthgate cannot assure investors that it will achieve significant revenue or profitability or  if significant revenue or profitability is achieved  that the company will be able to sustain them 
at december   the company had million of cash and marketable securities and million of working capital 
the company has incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in every fiscal year since inception 
in the years ended december   and  the company incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively  and negative cash flows from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company took several actions to substantially reduce operating cash outflows 
these actions included reducing the company s workforce in december  amending the company s agreement with nbci to significantly reduce required cash payments  and amending or canceling several content arrangements 
further  if the company does not achieve its forecasted revenue levels in  management is prepared to implement additional cost reductions 
based on the company s current forecasted cash flows and its cash and marketable securities on hand  the company expects to have sufficient cash to finance its operations through at least the company s future beyond is dependent upon its ability to achieve break even or positive cash flow  or raise additional financing 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to do so 
revenue the company derives revenue primarily from services and  to a lesser extent  from online advertising  sponsorship and e commerce 
services revenue services revenue has been derived principally from development  implementation and hosting fees associated with choice web sites  syndicating the company s content to third party web sites and activepress services 
revenue from choice web sites  content syndication and activepress services is recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements which generally range from one to three years 
healthgate commercially introduced its choice web site product in early and in october  the company released its choice platform 
as of december   healthgate had a contracted base of over hospitals 
under choice web site arrangements  healthgate is generally paid an upfront fee for developing  implementing and hosting a choice web site for a customer 
in addition  the arrangements provide the opportunity to place third party advertising and sponsorship on the customer s choice web site 
healthgate collects the fees for this advertising and sponsorship from the third party and pays a commission to the customer 
however  as part of an agreement with of the initial choice customers  healthgate guaranteed minimum advertising and sponsorship commissions to these customers in amounts approximately equal to the fees paid to healthgate by the customer for the initial term of their choice agreements and  in a few cases  in amounts that exceed those fees 
once these customers have paid the upfront fee to healthgate or  if applicable  to an authorized reseller  healthgate is obligated to pay these guaranteed commissions to the customer  generally on a quarterly basis  regardless of whether or not any advertising or sponsorship has actually been sold on the choice web site 
healthgate entered into these types of arrangements for promotional purposes to establish the choice web site product but  beginning in july  discontinued the use of these arrangements as a standard practice 
revenue from fees received for choice web site development  implementation and hosting is recognized ratably over the term of the underlying agreement  which generally ranges from one to three years 
for those arrangements in which there is guaranteed advertising and sponsorship commissions  healthgate did not recognize revenue unless the guaranteed commissions were less than the fees paid to healthgate 
instead  payments made by the customer are treated as a customer deposit 
any excess of fees paid over guaranteed commissions is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
if the advertising and sponsorship commissions that was guaranteed to the customer exceeds the fees paid to healthgate  the excess is recorded as expense upon signing the agreement 
for arrangements in which the company sells through a reseller  no revenue is recognized until an agreement between healthgate  the choice customer and the authorized reseller has been finalized and the choice web site has been delivered 
as advertising or sponsorship on these choice web sites is sold to third parties  healthgate will recognize advertising revenue from these choice web sites 
in november  healthgate entered into a three year development agreement with columbia information systems  inc  a subsidiary of columbia hca healthcare corporation  to design  develop and maintain customized  co branded choice web sites for up to columbia hca hospitals and affiliates 
the agreement provides for an annual license fee of million to be paid by columbia information systems for all products and services that healthgate provides under the agreement 
the agreement can be terminated without cause by columbia information systems on june   upon payment of a million termination fee to healthgate 
the license fees are being recognized ratably over each annual period 
online advertising  sponsorship and e commerce advertising and sponsorship revenue has included revenue from banner advertising and sponsorship of discrete portions of healthgate s content libraries 
advertising revenue is derived principally from short term advertising contracts in which healthgate typically guarantees a minimum number of impressions to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
advertising revenue is recognized in the period in which the advertisement is displayed at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over total guaranteed impressions or on a straight line basis over the term of the contract  provided that we do not have any significant obligations remaining 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met  recognition of the corresponding revenue is deferred until the guaranteed impressions are delivered 
sponsorship revenue is derived principally from contracts ranging from one to six months 
sponsorships are designed to support broad marketing objectives  including brand promotion  awareness  product introductions  online research and the integration of advertising with editorial content 
sponsorship revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the applicable agreements 
prior to march  advertising and sponsorship revenue also included barter revenue  which represents an exchange of advertising space on healthgate s own web sites for reciprocal advertising space on other web sites 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized during the period in which the advertisements are displayed 
barter transactions are recorded at the fair value of the advertisements provided 
barter expenses are recognized when healthgate s advertisements are run on the reciprocal web sites  which is typically in the same period during which the advertisements are run on healthgate s web sites 
barter expenses are included in sales and marketing expenses 
these barter transactions have no impact on the company s cash flows and  typically  no significant impact on results of operations 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  healthgate discontinued the practice of entering into revenue generating barter transactions 
e commerce revenue has been derived principally from individual user online subscriptions and from transaction fees for fee based access to portions of the healthgate web sites 
revenue from user subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  and revenue from transaction based fees is recognized when the related service is provided 
in order to concentrate on the service aspect of its choice  syndication and activepress businesses  the company chose to phase out its advertising  sponsorship and e commerce operations in november healthgate is currently continuing to serve advertising promotions for certain advertisers in order to fulfill their advertising orders and continues to use e commerce to provide full text journals via the activepress service on a pay per view or transaction fee basis 
in december  healthgate entered into an e commerce sponsorship agreement with medical self care  inc selfcare  a seller of health related products and services 
under the agreement  healthgate developed a co branded healthgate selfcare web site  and agreed to provide promotions for this co branded site over the month term of the agreement 
the agreement provided for selfcare to make annual cash payments to healthgate of approximately million in the first year  million in the second year and million in the third year 
in addition  for the first year of services under the agreement  selfcare issued  shares of its series h preferred stock to healthgate on february  healthgate recorded these shares at a value of approximately million when received 
healthgate had been recognizing revenue for the first year fees  including the value of preferred stock received  ratably over the first annual period of the agreement 
in august  healthgate and selfcare each filed litigation claims against each other related to this agreement 
see legal proceedings 
due to the uncertainty of this matter  healthgate concluded that its investment in selfcare preferred stock was impaired and  accordingly  recorded a charge in the third quarter of to write off the carrying value of this investment 
additionally  healthgate suspended revenue recognition related to services provided to selfcare during the third quarter of on december  the rights and obligations of selfcare were assumed by development specialists  inc dsi 
healthgate reached agreement with dsi in february to settle healthgate s litigation against selfcare for a claim in liquidation of million and a release of all of selfcare s claims against healthgate 
the company is uncertain what amount  if any  it will ultimately realize on this settlement and has not recognized any amount related to the settlement in its financial statements 
the company s results of operations for the year ended december  include revenue of million related to this agreement 
the company s balance sheet at december  includes net deferred revenue of million relating to selfcare 
this amount will be recorded as other income at the time the company determines what amount  if any  will be realized on the liquidation of selfcare 
non cash expenses healthgate recorded deferred compensation of million in the year ended december   representing the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted and the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grants 
the difference is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options  typically three years 
of the total deferred compensation amount  million and million was amortized in and  respectively  which was recorded as stock based compensation expense 
in addition   was recorded for consultant stock options as stock based compensation in during the years ended december  and  options to purchase shares of common stock  were forfeited without exercise  and the related  and  of deferred compensation was reversed in and  respectively

under the terms of this agreement  ge medical systems may sell healthgate s standard choice web site product and ge medical systems branded enhanced versions of healthgate s choice web site product through its worldwide sales force into its worldwide customer base of hospitals and other patient care facilities 
healthgate believes that this agreement benefits the company through the association of the ge medical systems name with healthgate in general  and with the choice product in particular  and through the efforts of ge medical systems to distribute both the standard choice product and the ge medical systems enhanced versions of the choice product 
therefore  in connection with this agreement  in june  healthgate issued a warrant to general electric company for the purchase of up to  shares of its common stock 
the warrant has a term of five years  was immediately exercisable and had an original exercise price of per share  which exercise price was adjusted to per share on january  the fair value of this warrant was determined to be million at the time of issuance using the black scholes option pricing model

this conclusion was based on the company s continued operating losses and workforce reduction  and a modification of its business model to expand focus beyond the hospital market 
the company used a discounted cash flow model  applying a discount rate to projected net cash flow relating to this marketing and distribution rights agreement through its remaining term  and arrived at an estimated fair value for the asset of approximately million 
the company s results of operations for the year ended december  include a charge of million relating to this impairment
