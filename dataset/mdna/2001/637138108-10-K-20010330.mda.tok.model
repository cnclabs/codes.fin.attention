item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the financial condition and earnings results of operations of the company with a primary focus on the company s performance 
financial condition during total assets increased to billion  an increase of million or over the billion at year end total assets at the end of increased million or over the billion at year end the increase in is reflected primarily in the loan category  which increased million  of which million was due to the acquisition of panasia bank in july  and the investment category  which increased million  of which million is related to panasia bank 
total cash and cash equivalents increased million or in compared to versus an increase of million or in compared to the increase in compared to is due to increased cash and due from banks of million  increased federal funds sold of million and increased interest bearing deposits in banks of million 
net loans and leases increased to billion during  an increase of million or compared to net loans increased million in or compared to loan growth in was primarily the result of the addition of million in loans from the acquisition of panasia bank and the investment of deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and federal funds purchased 
residential mortgages originated for immediate resale during amounted to million 
the company s credit quality is reflected by the annualized ratio of net chargeoffs to total loans of 
for versus 
for the year  and the ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans of 
at december   compared to 
at december  nonperforming assets  including nonaccruals  loans days past due  restructured loans and other real estate owned  were million at december   compared to million at december  of these amounts  nonaccrual loans represented million and million at december   and december   respectively 
loans days past due and still accruing interest were million and million at december   and december   respectively 
other real estate owned was  at december  and  at december   respectively 
the company had no restructured loans at december  or december  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets was and at december  and december   respectively 
the company has no significant exposure to energy and agricultural related loans 
investments  which are the company s secondary use of funds  increased million or to million at year end in  the investment portfolio reflected a decrease of million or compared to the increase in was due to the addition of million in investments from the acquisition of panasia bank and investment purchases of million  primarily in mortgage backed securities  which were partially offset by calls and maturities of securities  investment securities sales and payments on mortgage backed securities 
other assets increased to million  an increase of million or compared to the million at december  in  other assets increased million or compared to the increase in is due primarily to the million in goodwill from the acquisition of panasia bank  which is being amortized over a twenty year period 
goodwill represents the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and  under current accounting guidelines  the amortization of which will appear in the company s financial statements as an expense over the period indicated 
as the primary source of funds  aggregate deposits of billion increased million or compared to deposits of billion increased million in or compared to the increase in deposits is primarily in interest bearing deposits  which increased million while non interest bearing deposits increased million  largely due to the acquisition of million in deposits in the panasia bank acquisition in july in addition to deposits  earning assets are funded to some extent through purchased funds and borrowings 
these include securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  short term borrowings  long term borrowings  and subordinated debentures 
in the aggregate  these funds totaled million at the end of  a million or increase compared to the amount of borrowings and purchased funds of million represented an increase of million or compared to the increase in was due to an increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased  of million  which was partially offset by a decrease in long term borrowings of million 
shareholders equity increased by million or in to million 
this increase was principally due to an increase in the valuation adjustment for securities available for sale 
cash dividends paid in increased  or compared to the cash dividends paid in  which increased million or compared to cash dividends paid in earnings retained in were compared to in results of operations net income for of million was more than the million reported in the amount was more than the million in on a per share basis  basic earnings were   and for   and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were   and for   and  respectively 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on assets and interest expense on liabilities 
net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million 
the increase in interest income is a result of increased loan income of million and increased investment income of million due to growth in loan outstandings and higher rates on loans that were partially offset by growth in deposits and higher rates on deposits and borrowings 
the company s interest rate spread decreased from in to in the primary reasons for this decrease are the increased investment in bank owned life insurance from which the income is reported in other income but the cost of funding the investment is included in interest expense  and the increase in the investment portfolio utilizing incremental borrowings that result in a spread that is narrower than historical spreads but ultimately provides increased net interest income 
interest rate risk is a major concern in forecasting the earnings potential

interest expense during increased million or compared to the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is a result of increased interest on deposits of million and increased interest on securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased of million due to an increase in outstandings and higher rates on deposits and borrowings 
this was partially offset by a decrease in interest on long term borrowings of million 
interest expense during increased million or compared to in addition to the current rate environment  the cost of attracting and holding deposited funds is an ever increasing expense in the banking industry 
these increases are the real costs of deposit accumulation and retention  including fdic insurance costs  marketing and branch overhead expenses 
such costs are necessary for continued growth and to maintain and increase market share of available deposits 
the provision for loan losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  and million for both the year ended december  and the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was at both year end and year end net loan chargeoffs of million  million  and million during   and  respectively  continue to be comparable with those of the company s peers 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses  which are inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve based on historical trends  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial and industrial loans  real estate development loans  and construction loans which have been identified by bank management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole or part is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding and commitments that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial loans  real estate development and construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances which are subject to a guarantee by a government agency 
this space intentionally left blank 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions  which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information  which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses loan loan loan loan loan type to type to type to type to type to total total total total total allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans commercial and industrial      real estate loans construction and land dev 
     residential      other      loans to individuals      unallocated  n a  n a  n a  n a  n a this allocation is made for analytical purposes 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio commercial and industrial loans  real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all or part of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
loans to individuals are charged off any time repayment is deemed highly unlikely or as soon as the loan becomes days delinquent 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses 
a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower 
non performing assets table december  nonaccrual loans      loans past due or more days as to interest or principal      total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets      at december   management believes that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
other income increased million or in compared to  as a result of increased other service charges and fees of million  increased mortgage banking income of million  increased services charges on deposit accounts of million  increased trust income of  increased bank owned life insurance income of  and increased net gains on sale of investment securities of  the increase in other income in compared to was million or as a result of increased other service charges and fees of million  increased trading revenue of million  an activity that was discontinued by the end of  increased mortgage banking income of million  increased trust income of  increased bank owned life insurance income of  and increased service charges on deposit accounts of  these gains were partially offset by a decrease in net gains on sale of investment securities of million and a decrease in equity in undistributed net earnings of affiliates of  sales of investment securities in and totaled million and million  respectively 
other expenses increased million or in compared to as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million  increased other operating of million and increased net premises and equipment of  other expenses increased million or in when compared to  as a result of increased salaries  wages and benefits of million  increased net premises and equipment of  which was partially offset by a decrease in other operating of  for   and  there are no individual items of other operating expenses that exceed one percent of the aggregate of total interest income and other income  with the exception of advertising and marketing related expenses 
income before income taxes increased in by million or compared to when income before income taxes increased by million or compared to income taxes increased  in compared to while income taxes decreased  compared to the company s effective tax rate is for  for  and for  respectively 
this is due to the company s investments in tax advantaged municipal securities and bank owned life insurance 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
funding affecting short term liquidity  including deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  and short term borrowings increased million during long term borrowings decreased million during the goal of interest rate sensitivity management is to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
such sensitivity is measured as the difference in the volume of assets and liabilities in the existing portfolio that are subject to repricing in a future time period 
the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  repricing periods within three months one year over three through through five months one year five years years in thousands assets interest bearing deposits at banks  investment securities     loans     other assets   liabilities and equity non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits     borrowed funds     preferred securities  other liabilities  hedging instruments    shareholders equity  interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the fourth calendar quarter of the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will reprice at contractual repricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for repricing based on historical deposit decay rate analyses  as well as historical moving averages of run off for the company s deposits in these categories 
while generally subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a portion of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based upon the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
specifically  of these deposits are considered repriceable within three months and are considered repriceable in the over five year category 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would increase in a falling interest rate environment and would decrease in a rising interest rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval of within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows mvpe change in interest rate amount change in thousands basis points  basis points  basis points  flat rate  basis points  basis points  basis points  management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
if the company should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its mvpe subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such mismatch 
the company could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or it could attract deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
the company anticipates interest rate levels will fall in the first half of  with no clear indication of sustainable rising or falling rates thereafter 
given this assumption  the company s asset liability strategy for is to maintain a negative gap position interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing greater than interest earning assets subject to repricing for periods up to a year 
the impact of a falling or constant interest rate environment on net interest income is not expected to be significant to the company s results of operations 
effective monitoring of these interest sensitivity gaps is the priority of the company s asset liability management committee
