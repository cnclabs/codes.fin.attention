item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation year in review southwest posted a profit for the th consecutive year and a record annual profit for the ninth consecutive year 
this excellent financial performance was achieved despite the highest jet fuel prices since operating revenues and operating income were the highest in the company s history 
southwest s margin performance was the best in years with an operating margin of percent and net profit margin before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of percent 
the company s revenue growth and continued strong demand for our product were evident through our achievement of a record load factor revenue passenger miles divided by available seat miles of percent and record load factors in three of the four calendar quarters of at the end of  southwest served cities in states 
we continued our east coast expansion in  adding service to albany  new york  in may  and buffalo  new york  in october and have been very pleased with the results in each of these new southwest cities 
the company recently announced plans to commence service to west palm beach  florida in january and will begin service to at least one other new city in in addition  we plan to continue to add flights and additional frequencies between cities we already serve 
capacity is expected to grow approximately percent in with the net addition of aircraft 
the company will acquire new boeing s scheduled for delivery during the year and plans to retire four of the company s older s 
results of operations compared with the company s consolidated income for before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million per share  diluted  an increase of percent 
the cumulative change in accounting principle  related to the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 was million  net of taxes of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income  after the cumulative change in accounting principle  was million 
diluted net income per share  after consideration of the accounting change  was compared to 
in operating income was  million  an increase of percent compared to operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased percent primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues primarily resulted from the company s increased capacity  strong demand for commercial air travel  and excellent marketing and revenue management 
the company experienced a percent increase in revenue passengers carried  a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms  and a percent increase in passenger revenue yield per rpm passenger yield 
the increase in passenger yield was primarily due to an percent increase in average passenger fare  partially offset by a percent increase in average length of passenger haul 
the increase in average passenger fare was primarily due to modest fare increases taken combined with a higher mix of full fare passengers 
the increase in rpms exceeded a percent increase in available seat miles asms resulting in a load factor of percent  or points above the prior year 
the increase in asms resulted primarily from the net addition of aircraft during the year 
thus far  load factors in january have exceeded those experienced in january bookings for february and march are also good and we presently anticipate positive year over year unit revenue operating revenues divided by asms comparisons again in first quarter  although we do not expect to match the fourth quarter year over year unit revenue growth rate of percent 
the immediately preceding two sentences are forward looking statements  which involve uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
some significant factors include  but may not be limited to  competitive pressure such as fare sales and capacity changes by other carriers  general economic conditions  operational disruptions as a result of bad weather  industry consolidation  air traffic control related difficulties  the impact of labor issues  and variations in advance booking trends 
freight revenues increased percent primarily due to an increase in capacity 
other revenues  which consist primarily of charter revenues  increased percent 
this increase was less than the company s increase in capacity primarily due to the company s decision to utilize more of its aircraft to satisfy the strong demand for scheduled service and  therefore  make fewer aircraft available for charters 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm increased percent to  compared to

the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement which involves uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  the largely unpredictable levels of jet fuel prices and the effectiveness of the company s hedges 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent primarily because of a decrease in engine maintenance expense for the company s aircraft fleet as was an unusually high period for engine maintenance on these aircraft 
the engine repairs are expensed on a time and materials basis 
these engine repairs represented approximately percent of the total decrease  while a decrease in airframe inspections and repairs per asm represented the majority of the remaining total decrease 
the decrease in airframe inspections and repairs was primarily due to a greater amount of this work being performed internally versus  when a large portion of this type of work was outsourced 
therefore  in  a larger portion of the cost of these repairs is reflected in salaries and wages 
currently  we do not expect a significant increase in unit cost for maintenance materials and repairs in first quarter versus first quarter the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  any unscheduled required aircraft airframe or engine repairs and regulatory requirements 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent  primarily due to a decrease in commissionable revenue 
approximately percent of the company s revenues were attributable to direct bookings through the company s internet site compared to approximately percent in the prior year 
the increase in internet revenues contributed to the company s percentage of commissionable revenues decreasing from percent in to percent in the company recently announced a change in its commission rate policy 
beginning january   the company will decrease the commission it pays to travel agents from ten percent to eight percent for ticketless bookings  and from ten percent to five percent for paper ticket bookings 
the company will continue to pay no commission on internet agency bookings 
based on the policy change  the company expects agency commissions to decrease on a per asm basis in the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  changes in consumer ticket purchasing habits 
aircraft rentals decreased percent primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
approximately percent of the company s aircraft were under operating lease at december   compared to percent at december  based on the company s current new aircraft delivery schedule and scheduled aircraft retirements for  we expect a decline in aircraft rental expense per asm in the immediately preceding sentence is a forward looking statement involving uncertainties that could result in actual results differing materially from expected results 
such uncertainties include  but may not be limited to  changes in the company s current schedule for purchase and or retirement of aircraft 
landing fees and other rentals per asm decreased percent primarily as a result of a decrease in landing fees per asm of percent  partially offset by a slight increase in other rentals 
although landing fees declined on a per asm basis  they were basically flat on a per trip basis 
the growth in asms exceeded the trip growth primarily due to a percent increase in stage length the average distance per aircraft trip flown 
other operating expenses per asm decreased percent primarily due to company wide cost reduction efforts 
the company also reduced its advertising expense per asm  taking advantage of our national presence  increasing brand awareness  and strong customer demand 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense increased percent due primarily to the company s issuance of million of long term debt in fourth quarter capitalized interest decreased percent primarily as a result of lower progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries compared to interest income increased percent primarily due to higher invested cash balances and higher rates of return 
other losses in resulted primarily from a write down associated with the consolidation of certain software development projects

salaries  wages  and benefits per asm increased percent in this increase resulted primarily from increases in benefits costs  specifically workers compensation and health care expense 
retirement plans expense per asm increased slightly due to higher earnings available for profitsharing 
fuel and oil expenses per asm increased percent primarily due to a percent increase in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average price paid for jet fuel in was  including the effects of hedging activities  compared to 
in the company s average jet fuel price is net of approximately million in gains from hedging activities 
hedging activities in were not significant 
maintenance materials and repairs expense per asm increased percent in compared to routine heavy maintenance or airframe inspections and repairs represented approximately percent of the increase  while engine inspection and repair costs represented approximately percent of the increase 
the increase in airframe inspections and repairs was due primarily to a heavier volume of routine airframe checks scheduled for versus further  a portion of the company s scheduled airframe checks was outsourced in as the volume of work exceeded the available internal headcount and facilities necessary to perform such maintenance 
in  the company performed all of this type of routine heavy maintenance internally  thus  the majority of these costs were reflected in salaries and wages 
the increases in engine inspection and repair costs were primarily related to the company s aircraft 
the company s aircraft engine inspections and repairs are performed on a time and materials basis and are not covered by the company s power by the hour engine maintenance contract with general electric engine services  inc the aircraft experienced an increase both in the number of engine inspections and repairs and the average cost per repair 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of commissionable revenues to percent of total revenues in compared to percent in the decrease in percentage of commissionable revenues was primarily due to the growth in tickets purchased via the company s website from approximately percent in to approximately percent in aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
approximately percent of the company s aircraft fleet were under operating lease at december   compared to percent at december  depreciation expense per asm was flat for compared to although the company owned a higher percentage of its aircraft fleet in versus  unit cost was flat due to a change in the estimated useful lives of the company s boeing aircraft from years to years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this change in accounting estimate was made january   and resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense of approximately million for other operating expenses per asm increased 
percent primarily due to increased credit card processing costs resulting from a higher percentage of the company s ticket sales purchased with credit cards 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense decreased percent primarily due to the february redemption of million of senior unsecured notes originally issued in february capitalized interest increased percent as a result of higher progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries 
interest income decreased percent primarily due to lower invested cash balances 
other losses in resulted primarily from a write down associated with the consolidation of certain software development projects 
other gains in primarily consisted of contractual penalties received from boeing due to delays in the delivery of aircraft 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  increased slightly to percent in from percent in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared to billion in the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to the increase in operating income 
cash generated in was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures  provide working capital  and repurchase approximately million shares of company stock 
during  net capital expenditures were billion  which primarily related to the purchase of new and one used aircraft  and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries 
at december   capital commitments of the company primarily consisted of scheduled aircraft acquisitions and related flight equipment 
as of december   southwest had new s on firm order through  including to be delivered in the company also has options to purchase another s during and purchase rights for an additional s during aggregate funding required for firm commitments approximated billion through the year  of which million relates to see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on commitments 
on september   the company announced its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions  and may be discontinued at any time 
as of december   in aggregate  million shares had been repurchased at a total cost of million  of which million was completed in the company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments  including cash on hand at december   of million  internally generated funds  and a revolving credit line with a group of banks of up to million none of which had been drawn at december  
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements 
the company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of million of public debt securities  which it may utilize for aircraft financings in and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in that it holds floating rate debt instruments and has commodity price risk in that it must purchase jet fuel to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to minimize its average jet fuel cost through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of the types of hedges it utilizes to decrease its exposure to jet fuel price increases and with fixed rate debt instruments 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
airline operators are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and  therefore  are impacted by changes in jet fuel prices 
jet fuel and oil consumed in and represented approximately and percent of southwest s operating expenses  respectively 
southwest endeavors to acquire jet fuel at the lowest prevailing prices possible 
because jet fuel is not traded on an organized futures exchange  liquidity for hedging is limited 
however  the company has found that crude oil contracts and heating oil contracts are effective commodities for hedging jet fuel 
the company utilizes financial derivative instruments for both short term and long term time frames when it appears the company can take advantage of market conditions 
at december   the company had a mixture of purchased call options  collar structures  and fixed price swap agreements in place to hedge approximately percent of its total anticipated jet fuel requirements  approximately percent of its total anticipated jet fuel requirements  and a small portion of its total anticipated jet fuel requirements 
as of december   nearly all of the company s hedges  and the majority of its hedges  are effectively heating oil based positions 
all remaining hedge positions are crude oil based positions 
the amounts related to all the company s fuel hedge positions contained in the consolidated balance sheet at december  was million  which represents the aggregate net premium cost paid for option and or collar agreements 
this amount is classified as prepaid expense in current assets 
the company s fuel hedging strategy could result in the company not fully benefiting from certain jet fuel price declines 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the company s financial derivative instruments 
also see recent accounting developments in note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the new accounting requirements for financial derivative instruments effective january  the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   including amounts contained in the consolidated balance sheet at december   was approximately million 
a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in the underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments in place and their related cash flows up to approximately million 
airline operators are also inherently capital intensive  as the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an a credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with standard poor s and a a or equivalent credit ratings with two other rating agencies moody s and fitch 
the company s aircraft secured notes million and french credit agreements million do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
although there is interest rate risk associated with these secured borrowings  the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these borrowings 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december  and these long term notes represent only percent and percent of total noncurrent assets at december  and  respectively 
the unsecured long term debt currently has an average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing over the last ten years 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its unsecured long term debt because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that generally have maturities of three months or less 
as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low  as the investments generally mature within three months 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s debt instruments or its short term cash investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
because of the floating rate nature of the company s secured borrowings  a ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would correspondingly change the company s earnings and cash flows by approximately million in however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt or its cash investments
