revenue for license fees is typically recognized on delivery of our software when optio has a signed  noncancellable license agreement with the customer  the license fee is fixed and determinable  optio can objectively allocate the total fee among all elements of the arrangement  and the collection of the license fee is probable 
with the introduction of e 
comengine  some contracts may require significant production  modification or customization 
revenue on these contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis using actual costs incurred as a percentage of expected total costs 
monthly application service provider fees are consideration for access to the application software hosted and maintained on the company s or customer s servers and are recognized monthly as services are provided

research and development expenses also include expenses associated with independent contractors optio uses to augment its research and development efforts 
research and development expenses relate to activities performed prior to commercial production of a product 
to date optio has not capitalized any development costs because optio s short development cycle has historically resulted in only immaterial amounts of development costs that were eligible for capitalization

general and administrative expenses also include legal  other professional fees and allocable overhead

optio recognized  and  in compensation expense in the years ended january  and  respectively  and currently expects to recognize  and  in the years ending january  and  respectively 
as a professional sales and value added services organization  the company responds to the product opportunities and service demands from its clients 
accordingly  the company has limited control over the timing and circumstances under which its products and services are provided 
therefore  the company can experience volatility in its operating results from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future periods 
results of operations revenues the following table sets forth certain items from optio s statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated

license fee revenue decreased to million in from million in  however it increased to million in from million in license fee revenue decreased from to due to the following factors the primary contributing factor to the decrease in revenues was re staffing of optio s sales organization 
as optio continues to build its e business products  a more technical  more solutions based sales organization is needed 
optio had difficulty integrating the sales efforts for the new e 
comseries of products with the existing distributed output management dom products 
as a result  optio experienced significant turnover as some sales personnel could not make the transition to the e business market 
optio determined that the sales department was not properly structured in light of the changes that were taking place in the enterprise resource planning erp marketplace 
to move into the business to business integration space  optio determined that a geographically aligned sales force  as opposed to an erp aligned sales force  would be better suited for the market  optio s referral business followed the erp market  which was down significantly from the explosive growth that occurred in in response  in august  optio initiated its geographically aligned sales model and began to re staff the sales organization to allow the sales people to be nearer to the customer base that they would pursue 
as a result of the turnover and of the restructuring of the sales organization  revenues declined  optio s core product sales suffered due to a market shift in product requirements from dom systems to e business projects  these factors were slightly offset by the fact that muscato corporation and translink solution corporation s revenues were included subsequent to their acquisition dates 
however  the introduction of muscato corporation s products to optio s sales force created confusion of sales focus and execution  causing sales of optio s core products to suffer 
despite the decline in license fee revenue  optio s average selling price began to rise  particularly with the introduction of its e business products such as e 
comengine 
license fee revenue grew significantly from to due to the following factors growing market acceptance of optio s software  continued expansion of optio s sales and marketing organization from employees in to employees in  the introduction of optio s e 
compresent software in september  optio s growth in the european market  and optio s expansion into the asian pacific market in may revenue from services  maintenance and other increased to million in from million in and to million in from million in while license revenue decreased during the year ended january   services  maintenance and other increased due to the following factors maintenance revenue increased million  or due to the growth in optio s customer base  the introduction of approximately  in processing fee revenue to optio s revenue stream resulting from the purchase of translink solutions corporation 
optio now provides application service provider asp hosting of e 
comengine for which a monthly fee is charged  the sale of hardware related to a specific contract of approximately  in the three months ended july   the acquisition of muscato corporation and translink solutions corporation  contributing revenue subsequent to their acquisition dates of over million  partially offset by a slight decline in services to implement optio s core product s service revenue due to the associated slowing sales 
the increase in revenues from service  maintenance and other during the year ended january  was due to increased sales of software licenses to optio s customers resulting in increased implementation  training  and technical support of those products 
license fee revenue constituted   and of total revenue in   and  respectively 
services and other revenue constituted   and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
maintenance revenue constituted   and of total revenue in   and  respectively 
the fiscal year sales mix shifted towards maintenance revenue as optio s customer base grew  yet license fees declined and services revenue remained stable during the year 
the sales mix shift towards services revenue during the year ended january  was due to an increased focus by management on the marketing of services to optio s customers who had purchased software licenses as an additional source of revenue 
in addition  as optio s products became more sophisticated  additional consulting services and training was required  thus increasing services revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
costs of revenue costs of revenue from license fees decreased to  in from  in and increased to  in from  in the decrease in costs of revenue from license fees in was primarily the result of a decrease in sales through independent agents and thus  a decrease in independent agent fees 
these fees decreased from  in to  in this was offset by an increase in royalties paid for inclusion of others products within optio s products 
the increase in costs of revenue from license fees in was the result of increased referral fees paid to third party vendors associated with the increase in license revenue 
these fees increased to  in from  in costs of revenue from license fees represented of total license revenue in  in  and in costs of revenue from services and maintenance increased to million in from million in and to million in from million in the increase in was due to the following factors an emphasis on customer satisfaction that has resulted in increased headcount in the project management and implementation areas  increased training and mentoring of subcontracted consulting solution providers  the costs associated with holding training classes at various locations in the united states  and a significant increase in the use of subcontractors during  which typically provide a slightly lower gross margin 
the increase during was due to improved training and scheduling of internal staff and an increase in the number of personnel providing consulting  training and technical support to customers  both directly and via subcontract  in an effort to fulfill the obligations associated with the increased services and maintenance revenue over these periods 
costs of revenue from services and maintenance represented   and of total service and maintenance revenue in  and  respectively 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in and to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional hiring to support optio s expansion of both its north american and international operations and optio s expansion of its product base to include optio s e

depreciation and amortization expenses represented   and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
interest and other income loss interest and other income increased to  in from  in and increased to income of  in from a loss of  in the increase in was the result of the increased interest income resulting from the investment of the remaining net proceeds of optio s initial public offering in december this income was offset by interest expense associated with the million note payable to the former owners of muscato corporation 
the increase in was due to a combination of increased interest income resulting from the investment of the million net proceeds of optio s initial public offering in december and a decrease in interest expense due to the pay off of notes payable to related parties with the proceeds of the initial public offering
