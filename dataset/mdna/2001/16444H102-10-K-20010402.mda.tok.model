since may  we have principally been in the business of marketing and licensing the cherokee brand and related trademarks and other brands we own or represent 
our operating strategy emphasizes domestic and international retail direct and wholesale licensing  whereby we grant wholesalers and retailers the license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise 
in november  we reaffirmed our strategic relationship with target stores  a division of target corp  by entering into the amended target agreement  which grants target stores the exclusive right in the united states to use the cherokee trademarks in certain categories of merchandise 
see item business 
united states retail direct licensing 
under the amended target agreement  target stores will pay a royalty each fiscal year  up to and including the fiscal year ending january   based on a percentage of target stores net sales of cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year  which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise 
in any event  target stores has agreed to pay a minimum guaranteed royalty of million for each of the two fiscal years ending january  and and million for each of the four fiscal years ending january  through under the amended target agreement  in most cases  we or spell c must receive target stores consent to enter into additional licensing agreements in the united states with respect to the cherokee brand during the term of the agreement 
therefore  our current focus with respect to the cherokee brand is to continue to develop that brand in several international markets through retail direct or wholesale licenses with manufacturers or other companies who have market power and economies of scale in the respective markets 
target stores currently has over stores in the united states and has publicly announced that it expects to open another to stores in the next twelve months 
we expect that these additional stores will result in an increase in the overall sales volume of cherokee branded products sold by target stores  however  there can be no assurance that overall sales volume will increase 
target stores pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of cherokee branded products 
the amended target agreement  however  is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for target stores after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of cherokee branded products during each fiscal year 
in fiscal target stores reached the maximum royalty rate reduction in the end of the second quarter 
additional stores are expected to cause target stores to reach the maximum royalty rate reduction even earlier in the upcoming year 
this trend is expected to have a positive impact on our licensing revenues in our first quarter ended may  as well as our licensing revenues for our entire fiscal year ended february   but may have a negative impact on our licensing revenues in our third quarter ended november  as part of a recapitalization that occurred in september  we sold to spell c  our wholly owned subsidiary  all of our rights to the cherokee brand and related trademarks in the united states and assigned to spell c all of our rights in the amended target agreement in exchange for the proceeds from the sale of the secured notes 
see item business 
recapitalization  sale of cherokee trademarks to spell c  issuance of secured notes 
spell c issued for an aggregate of million  privately placed zero coupon secured notes  yielding interest per annum and maturing on february  the secured notes amortize quarterly from may  through february   in the amount of million per year the first two years and million per year the third through sixth years 
the secured notes are secured by the amended target agreement and the united states cherokee brand name and trademarks 
the secured notes indenture provides that any royalties generated by the amended target agreement must be deposited directly into a collection account controlled by the trustee under the indenture for distribution to holders of the secured notes 
excess amounts in the collection account may be distributed to spell c only if the excess amounts exceed the aggregate amount of principal due and payable on the next quarterly note payment date 
such excess amounts  if any  will then be distributed by spell c to us 
since the aggregate payments due under the amended target agreement are million and equal the aggregate minimum guaranteed royalty payable under the amended target agreement  which is also million  there is no assurance that there will be any excess amounts to be distributed 
see item risk factors 
target stores commenced the initial sales of cherokee branded merchandise in july royalty revenues from target stores were million during the fiscal year ended may   million during the eight month fiscal period ended january   million during the fiscal year ended january   million during fiscal and million during fiscal  which accounted for    and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues during such periods 
while all royalties paid under the amended target agreement appear in our consolidated financial statements  since the issuance of the secured notes  most of such royalties have been  and most  if not all of such royalties received until the maturity of the secured notes  will be distributed to the holders of the secured notes 
see item risk factors 
prior to the maturity of the secured notes  royalties from the amended target agreement will be offset by principal payments to the holders of the secured notes in the amount of million per year during the first two years and million per year during the third through sixth years of the term of the indenture 
during fiscal  of the million in royalty revenues received from target stores  million was paid to the holders of the secured notes 
at various times during fiscal  spell c distributed a total of million to us which amount includes royalty revenues received from target stores during both fiscal and fiscal and interest income earned on royalty revenues 
while we believe that royalties payable under the amended target agreement may continue to exceed the minimum guaranteed royalty payable thereunder  we cannot predict this with any accuracy 
the revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during the fiscal year ended may  were million  during the eight month fiscal period ended january  were million  during the fiscal year ended january  were million  during fiscal were million and during fiscal were million  which accounted for    and  respectively  of our revenues during such periods 
in november  we purchased the sideout brand and related trademarks from sideout sport  inc for approximately million and a portion of the future royalties generated by the sideout brand 
under the terms of the sideout agreement  we agreed to pay sideout sport inc  on a quarterly basis  of the first million  of the next million and of the next million  of royalties and license fees received by us through licensing of the sideout trademarks 
upon the earlier of such time as we have paid sideout a total of million or october   we will have no further obligation to pay sideout sport inc during fiscal  we made additional contingent payments of million under the sideout agreement 
since january  we have paid  in total  million in contingent payments under the sideout agreement 
the sideout brand generated licensing revenues from existing contracts of approximately million during fiscal  which accounted for approximately of our revenues during such period 
see item business 
sideout agreement 
as an incentive for our licensees to achieve higher retail sales of cherokee or sideout branded products  many of our existing license agreements  including the amended target agreement  are structured to provide royalty rate reductions for the licensees after they achieve certain levels of retail sales of cherokee or sideout branded products during each fiscal year 
as a result  our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees retail sales of branded products are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease throughout each fiscal year as licensees reach certain retail sales thresholds contained in their respective license agreements 
therefore  the amount of royalty revenue received by us in any quarter is dependent not only on retail sales of branded products in such quarter  but also on the level of retail sales  and the resulting attainment of royalty rate reductions in any preceding quarters in the same fiscal year 
the size of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each licensing agreement 
as of november   we and the newstar group  d b a the wilstar group wilstar entered into a second revised and restated management agreement which revised and restated the terms under which wilstar agreed to continue to provide us with the executive management services of our chief executive officer robert margolis 
mr 
margolis is currently the sole stockholder of wilstar 
on january   wilstar assigned the management agreement to mr 
margolis 
as base compensation for services rendered  mr 
margolis will be paid  per fiscal year  subject to annual cost of living increases 
mr 
margolis is also eligible for annual performance bonuses 
the management agreement provides  that  for each fiscal year after fiscal  if our ebitda for such fiscal year is no less than million  then mr 
margolis will receive a performance bonus equal to x of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million up to million  plus y of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million 
as a result  for fiscal we accrued a bonus of million for mr 
margolis and if our ebitda continues to increase  the bonus payable to mr 
margolis under the management agreement will also increase 
we are frequently approached by parties seeking to sell their brands and related trademarks 
should an established and marketable brand become available on favorable terms  we would be interested in pursuing such an acquisition 
in addition to acquiring brands and licensing our own brands  we assist other companies in identifying licensees for their brands 
during fiscal  we assisted mossimo inc in locating target stores as a licensee of the mossimo brand and entered into a finder s agreement with mossimo  which provides that we will receive of the royalties paid to mossimo by target stores 
under mossimo s agreement with target stores  target stores is obligated to pay mossimo a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of mossimo branded products  with a minimum guaranteed royalty  beginning in  of approximately million over the initial three year term of the agreement 
mossimo s agreement with target stores is subject to early termination under certain circumstances 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received initial revenues from mossimo of  mossimo s filings with the securities and exchange commission indicate that there is currently substantial doubt about mossimo s ability to continue as a growing concern 
if mossimo should enter into bankruptcy proceedings  under bankruptcy law there is a possibility mossimo could reject the finders agreement and prevent us from receiving any of the royalties paid by target stores to mossimo 
additionally  we entered into five other exclusive consulting agreements  one to represent maui and sons inc in the united states and canada  one to represent pritikin worldwide  one to represent bum in mainland china  hong kong and macao  one to represent rampage in the philippines  mainland china  hong kong  macao  korea  taiwan  singapore  malaysia  indonesia  thailand  vietnam and cambodia and one with aspen licensing international inc to represent its aspen brand both domestically and internationally 
the consulting agreement with aspen licensing international inc expired during fiscal in  our board changed our fiscal year end to a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january in order to better align us with our licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year 
prior to this change our fiscal year was a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest may as a result  the fiscal year ended on may  and included weeks  the eight month fiscal period ended on january  and included weeks  the fiscal year ended on january  and included weeks  fiscal ended on january  and included weeks and fiscal ended on february  and included weeks

qualitative and quantitative disclosures of market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest from time to time we invest our excess cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us 
our only long term debt obligations are the secured notes  which are zero coupon secured notes yielding interest of interest per annum 
this long term debt obligation does not represent a material interest rate risk to us 
foreign currency we conduct business in various parts of the world 
we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business  however  revenues from international licensing comprise of our consolidated revenues 
for fiscal  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where we operate was not material
