results of operations compared to net income for the company increased in contributing to this increase was an improvement in the company s statutory combined ratio to in from in positively impacting the company s operations in was a change in the services provided by state auto p c that generated an increase in management services income 
see discussion below 
consolidated earned premiums increased in this increase was principally the result of the change in the pooled subsidiaries aggregate pooled participation percentage from to referred to above 
this action increased consolidated earned premiums 
the standard insurance segment s internal growth  as written by the pooled companies  excluding the impact of the change in the pooling arrangement  decreased consolidated earned premiums by 
the company s nonstandard insurance segment s internal growth also decreased consolidated earned premiums by approximately 
also negatively impacting the company s consolidated earned premiums by approximately  was a return of premiums to the policyholders in the state of north carolina as a result of a rate reduction dating back to that was mandated by the insurance department of that state 
in and  the north carolina rate bureau ncrb filed an auto rate increase which was challenged by the north carolina insurance department 
the parties agreed to a settlement of the dispute in late march  which resulted in a rate reduction for the rate filing and the rate filing being approved as originally filed by the ncrb 
consequently  the company was required to return approximately million in disputed premiums  plus  in interest 
the interest portion of the returned premium has been reflected in the miscellaneous expense line item 
as noted in prior reports  during  the underwriting performance of the companies commercial lines book of business written by its standard segment began to evidence deterioration from previous performance levels 
this prompted management to commence a careful review of its underwriters adherence to the company s underwriting guidelines for commercial lines 
this action had a negative impact on direct written premiums in that continued into the first half of during the latter half of  the company saw commercial lines sales activity increase over levels 
the pooled companies experienced growth in its commercial lines direct written premiums over the company s personal lines of business within its standard segment continued to feel the effects of extreme price competition even though  during the first half of  there was some evidence that an increasing number of companies were reacting to continuing underwriting losses by increasing rates 
the company s rate of decline in internal growth in these lines has diminished in the last half of  but internal growth remained negative 
the company believes that its underwriting and pricing discipline was a key factor in the company s underwriting results for the year  particularly as compared to other property casualty insurers 
the company believes that its strategy of taking modest price increases on a regularly scheduled basis and continuing its diligence in risk selection has positioned it to take advantage of this change in the market that the company perceives is occurring 
the company is active in the personal and commercial lines markets  developing new products to enhance its product portfolio  appointing new agents in its operating territories  and refining its pricing levels for the markets and lines it believes offer the most profit potential 
the company s nonstandard insurance segment national and mid plains earned premium was million in and million in  an decrease

losses and loss expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the loss ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
the increase in the current year loss ratio was largely the result of the company experiencing a relatively small number of large unusual commercial claims in its standard insurance segment 
management noted that these large commercial losses did not impact any one line of business or geographic region and does not believe the nature of these claims indicates deterioration in core underwriting operations 
see discussion above regarding management s response to its perception of the current underwriting environment 
additionally  the company s nonstandard segment experienced an increase in its losses over levels particularly in those states where national began operations in the nonstandard segment is particularly volatile for new states due to the relatively small level of premium earned in the initial years of operation 
management has been monitoring the premium rate adequacy in these new states and has reacted throughout accordingly by increasing rates in these new states 
acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the expense ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
the increase in the expense ratio is impacted by the fixed costs such as salaries  depreciation and utilities which comprised a larger portion of earned premiums in than they did in as a result of the company s less than anticipated premium writings in interest expense relates to the line of credit agreement the company entered into with mutual during the second quarter of to assist in the funding of its stock repurchase program

the addition of mid plains to the nonstandard insurance segment increased consolidated earned premiums 
however  the nonstandard insurance segment decreased consolidated earned premiums by 
like many other insurers in its industry  was a difficult year for so called internal growth for the company 
in its standard insurance segment  management continued to stress responsible pricing and sound underwriting despite a significant increase in aggressive price competition in both personal and commercial lines 
the company s personal lines program  prime of life  that targets the and over age group  continues to generate approximately of the company s new homeowner and automobile lines of business 
this age group also typically exhibits a significantly higher than average retention rate as a whole among all policyholders in a group than any other age group 
the company s underwriting experience in commercial lines showed some deterioration during  which prompted management to commence a careful review of adherence to its underwriting guidelines in these lines of business 
this same approach to underwriting also had an impact on the company s nonstandard insurance segment  which experienced a decrease in its earned premiums in this was the continuing result of significant auto physical damage rate increases  the continuation of a more restrictive underwriting posture first implemented by the company in this segment throughout most of its operating states in and increased competition in this market segment during while these actions have resulted in a decrease in the volume of business over the last several reporting periods  this segment s statutory loss experience continued to improve over comparative prior periods 
the statutory loss ratio for the year ended december  decreased to from for the same period in offsetting the decrease in earned premium was national s entry into three new states of operation during south carolina in the first quarter  maryland in the second quarter  and south dakota in the fourth quarter

the impact of the catastrophe losses amounted to gaap loss ratio points whereas catastrophe losses in totaled gaap loss ratio points

this is being addressed in the manner described above in the discussion concerning commercial lines underwriting

the improvement in segment profit in compared to was the result of a decrease in the level of catastrophe losses for this year 
prior to  the nonstandard segment focused on improving its loss experience through implementation of a more restrictive underwriting posture and rate increases in several operating states 
while this segment showed improvement as a result of these actions  experienced significant losses in several of its new states of operation 
as discussed above  management continually monitors this segment s premium rate adequacy given the nature of the risks that are written through the nonstandard market 
the investment management services segment profit increased slightly due to increasing market rates within the fixed maturity market 
this segment s revenue is based on the average market value of the portfolio of the companies managed  which is largely comprised of fixed maturities

when establishing rates  the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation subject to limitations imposed for competitive pricing 
inflation has been modest over the last several years thereby allowing pricing of premiums to keep pace with inflation on certain lines of business 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
