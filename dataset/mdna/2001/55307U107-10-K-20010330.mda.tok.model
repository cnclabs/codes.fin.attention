item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
on may   the partnership completed the purchase of the macadamia farming operations from four subsidiaries of c 
brewer and company  ltd 
the acquired assets consisted of acres of macadamia orchards  farming contracts  farming equipment  vehicles  a husking plant  irrigation well  office buildings  garages and warehouses  office furniture and equipment and material inventories related to macadamia farming 
all the assets and operations are located on the island of hawaii 
effective with the acquisition  the partnership began performing all the farming operations for its own  acres and for approximately  additional acres owned by other growers 
results of operations   owned orchard segment production and yields production and yield data for the eight orchards are summarized below expressed in wet in shell pounds at moisture average yield per acre orchard acquired acreage production keaau i june      keaau ii oct

    totals except yields which are averages      production for the orchards purchased in and is net of unusable nuts  as stated in their respective nut purchase agreements 
production for the orchards purchased in and includes all nuts delivered 
the nut purchase contracts for the and orchards require the purchaser  mauna loa macadamia nut corporation mauna loa  to purchase all of the nuts delivered from these orchards  which has been the case in all previous years 
in october  after mauna loa was sold to new owners  mauna loa did not pay for million pounds of unusable nuts from these orchards 
the partnership has filed a lawsuit to collect payment for these nuts 
the production numbers in the table above include the unusable nuts from the and orchards 
production in was lower for all orchards compared to due to the following reasons the ka u region was affected by a rainstorm and flood in november which caused an estimated loss of million pounds of nuts 
after the heavy rains  the trees prematurely dropped large quantities of nuts that would normally have been dropped and harvested in the first and second quarters of the net loss of nuts is estimated at  pounds for the year an estimated shortage of production of million pounds is expected in production in the ka u region was hindered by a third consecutive year of drought before the november rainstorm 
rainfall through october was only inches compared to the region s ten year average of inches of rain 
production in keaau and mauna kea in was exceptionally high due to the timing of nut drop and harvesting 
the main harvesting is normally from fall to early spring 
the calendar year benefited from a late harvest in the season and an early harvest in the fall spring season 
subsequently  the calendar year received a small harvest in the beginning of its year 
for  overall nut production increased by over the previous year 
the combined keaau orchards increased over  and the mauna kea orchards were up 
as mentioned above  both regions benefited form harvest timing 
the ka u region showed some signs of a rebound after two years of drought  with an increase in production of over the ka u green shoe i orchard and the mauna kea orchard are not yet fully mature 
as a result  the yields from these orchards are expected to be lower on average over the next few years than for the partnership s mature orchards 
at full maturity under favorable growing conditions  a macadamia orchard can produce between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at ka u and between  and  wis pounds of macadamia nuts per acre each year at keaau 
no trees have reached full maturity in the mauna kea area  but it is expected that production at maturity at the mauna kea orchard will approximate keaau levels 
owned orchard segment nut revenue macadamia nut revenues depend on the number of producing acres  yields per acre and the nut purchase price 
the impact of these factors is summarized in the following table over over trees acres harvested    average yield wis lbs 
acre    nuts harvested s wis lbs 
   nut price wis lbs 
gross nut sales s    in the table above  nuts harvested does not include the million pounds of unusable nuts from the and orchards 
under the nut purchase contracts with mauna loa  the price for nuts delivered is based on the two year trailing average of usda published macadamia nut prices and on a netback component 
the netback component is determined by subtracting from mauna loa s gross revenues from the sale of macadamia products i allocable processing  packaging  marketing  selling and advertising costs and ii a capital charge on the difference between those aggregate gross revenues and aggregate allocable costs 
the following table sets forth the manner in which the nut purchase price per pound was determined for  and lb 
usda price two years prior a usda price one year prior a usda price two year trailing average gross revenues less allocable processing  packaging  marketing  sales and advertising costs less capital charge net back component usda price two year trailing average net back component average of usda two year trailing average price and net back component plus hawaii general excise tax net purchase price b c d a mauna loa s own purchases comprise a substantial portion of nut purchases reported to the usda 
therefore  the usda price component of the purchase price is  to a substantial degree  the average price that mauna loa has paid to purchase macadamia nuts from the partnership and from third parties during the previous two years 
b the nut purchase price for the and orchards was the same for and all previous years 
with the change of ownership of mauna loa in  a quality conversion factor in the nut purchase contracts was initiated 
the effect was to cause a slightly different price of for the orchards 
c the nut purchase contract covering nut production from the acre keaau lot orchard acquired in september defines the two year trailing average provision slightly differently from the and nut purchase contracts  and thus  results in a different nut price 
the nut price for this orchard was in  in and 
this orchard accounts for less than of the partnership s macadamia nut production 
d the nut purchase contract for the ka u o orchards purchased in may uses only the two year trailing usda average to determine its nut price  which was in the average nut price from all orchards declined from the usda portion fell  representing a general decline in worldwide macadamia prices caused by increased production  primarily in australia 
the netback component fell in compared to mauna loa sold an unusually large amount of its nuts as lower valued ingredient nuts  which reduced their average revenue per pound 
the average nut price declined from the average price in the netback component of the nut price declined due to decreased nut revenues per pound at mauna loa  but this was partially offset by a reduction of mauna loa s processing and marketing costs 
the usda published price for the crop year was per pound wis at moisture  which is higher than the price of and lower than the price of 
the usda two year trailing average which affects the partnership s nut price will be  a decrease over the two year average 
owned orchard segment cost of goods sold agricultural unit costs depend on the operating expenses required to maintain the orchards and to harvest the crop as well as on the quantity of nuts actually harvested 
the partnership s unit costs expressed in dollars per wet in shell pound at moisture are calculated by dividing all agricultural costs for each orchard including lease rent  property tax and tree insurance by the number of pounds of macadamia nuts produced by that orchard and are summarized below lb

all orchards as a result of the farming operations acquisition  the partnership now farms its own orchards  and some costs previously charged as farming expenses by kaci and mkaci were eliminated 
these are the hawaii general excise tax  capital recovery costs and the farming fee 
the partnership saved approximately  in hawaii general excise taxes for the last eight months of hawaii general excise taxes were  in and  in the capital recovery savings in were  capital recovery costs were  in and  in the elimination of the farming fee in saved the partnership approximately  the farming fee was  in and  in in addition  the general and administrative expenses incurred in the farming operation  which were previously billed and expensed as farming costs  have been classified for the may to december period as general and administration expenses 
this amounted to  in cost of goods sold was million less in than in  but the cost per pound was higher in the lower production costs in were due to the savings mentioned above and to a much smaller harvest in cost of goods sold in was  higher than in  but lower on a per pound basis compared to this was the lowest cost per pound ever achieved by the partnership and is the result of the large nut production  which spread the indirect and overhead farming costs over more pounds 
farming segment farming service revenue in connection with the acquisition  the partnership acquired approximately farming contracts to farm macadamia orchards owned by other growers 
these contracts cover macadamia orchards in the same three locations on the island of hawaii where the partnership owns orchards 
the farming contracts provide the partnership to be reimbursed for all direct farming costs cultivation  irrigation and harvesting  collect a pro rata share of indirect costs and overheads  and charge a management fee 
the management fee is based on the number of acres farmed or on a percentage of total costs billed 
revenues from farming services for may to december were million 
this total was less than expected by the partnership due to the november rainstorm and flood  which prohibited harvesting in some of the orchards under contract in the ka u region due to damage and debris in the orchards 
farming segment cost of services sold the cost of services sold relating to the farming contracts was million for the may to december period of these costs were all reimbursed to the partnership 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses are comprised of accounting and reporting costs  reimbursements to the managing partner for directors fees  office expenses and liability insurance  and the management fee 
in addition  general and administrative costs are also incurred in connection with the farming operations 
previous to the may acquisition  general and administration costs relating to the partnership s orchards were included in the partnership s farming expenses 
total general and administrative costs for were  higher than in all of this increase was due to costs that were previously charged as farming expenses 
with the acquisition  the partnership also assumed providing certain accounting services to subsidiaries of cbcl 
these services generated income of  in tthe partnership does not expect to provide any accounting services after in  general and administrative costs were  higher than in of this amount   was due to the higher management fee earned by the general partner  which is based on partnership cash flow 
the balance of this increase was due to legal costs incurred in litigation concerning a proxy contest in the merger attempt 
a management fee based on partnership cash flow is payable annually to the managing partner 
the amount paid was  for   for  and  for interest income and expense the partnership recorded interest expense of  in this was due to the long term loan used to acquire the farming operations  the assumption of several capitalized equipment leases  and interest expense on a new revolving line of credit 
there was no interest expense in or the partnership funds its working capital needs through funds on hand and  when needed  from short term borrowings  generating interest expense in the process 
net interest income or expense  therefore  is partly a function of any balance carried over from the prior year  the amount and timing of cash generated and distributions paid to investors in the current year  as well as the current level of interest rates 
throughout the partnership had cash on hand  earned  in interest income net of line of credit fees  and incurred no interest expense 
interest income was  in other income of  was recorded in due to a claim received on a crop insurance policy for the crop 
production in some fields in the ka u region were lower than their ten year average by more than a deductible due to the drought in that region 
merger transaction costs the partnership incurred special charges of million in the second quarter of resulting from the write off of costs related to the cancelled merger of the partnership with hawaii land and farming formerly c 
brewer homes  inc 
inflation and taxes in general  prices paid to macadamia nut farmers fluctuate independently of inflation 
macadamia nut prices are influenced strongly by prices for finished macadamia products  which depend on competition and consumer acceptance 
farming costs  particularly labor and materials  and general and administrative costs do generally reflect inflationary trends 
the partnership is subject to a gross income tax as a result of its election to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than to be taxed as a corporation  as allowed by the taxpayer relief act of this tax is calculated at on partnership gross income net revenues less cost of goods sold beginning in the gross income tax was  in   in and  in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in year is primarily due to the reductions in net income and accounts payable 
in and farming services were paid to kaci and mkaci days after the end of each quarter 
with the acquisition of the farming operations  these expenses  mostly payroll and benefits  are now paid within days 
on december  the partnership s working capital was million and its current ratio was to  down from million and to in the lower working capital for is due to the million expenditure on orchards and farming operations and to lower nut revenues 
the partnership s credit agreement requires a working capital minimum of million and a minimum current ratio of to since the financial results of the year were partially the result of the dispute with mauna loa  an event that was not controllable by the partnership  the partnership requested an amendment to its credit agreement to cure these violations 
pacific coast farm credit services agreed to amend the credit agreement to allow the amount of the mauna loa disputed revenue to be added to current assets for the purpose of these two financial calculations 
the amendment is temporary and will be rescinded at the earlier of a favorable outcome of the mauna loa dispute or on march  capital expenditures in were million  all due to the orchards and farming operations acquisition 
there were no capital expenditures in or capital expenditures planned for are less than  and are expected to be financed by way of new equipment leases 
macadamia nut farming is seasonal  with production peaking late in the fall 
however  farming operations continue year round 
as a result  additional working capital is required for much of the year 
the partnership meets its working capital needs with cash on hand  and when necessary  through short term borrowings under a million revolving line of credit 
the line of credit was obtained on may  and expires may  at december  the partnership had a cash balance of  and line of credit drawings outstanding of  the cash balance was million at the end of  and there were no line of credit drawings during it is the opinion of management that the partnership has adequate cash on hand and borrowing capacity available to meet anticipated working capital needs for operations as presently conducted 
however  with the september sale of mauna loa  the managing partner no longer has control over the timing of nut payments to the partnership 
the nut purchase contracts require mauna loa to make nut payments days after the end of each quarter 
during certain parts of the year  if payments are not received as the contracts require  available cash resources could be depleted 
legal proceedings mauna loa the partnership is a party to five macadamia nut purchase contracts with mauna loa 
three of these contracts  one written in and two in  require mauna loa to pay for all nuts delivered 
since the inception of these three contracts  mauna loa has always paid for all nuts delivered 
the other two nut purchase contracts were written in and and allow for the deduction of unusable nuts in calculating payment due 
on october   mauna loa made payment to the partnership for nuts delivered during the third quarter  but deducted from its payment all unusable nuts delivered by the partnership from january to september  on the and nut purchase contracts 
this deduction amounted to  on january  mauna loa made its payment to the partnership for fourth quarter nut deliveries 
mauna loa again deducted for unusable nuts on the and contracts 
the cumulative amount of disputed income and interest as of december  is  the partnership s legal counsel advised that mauna loa was required to pay for all nuts delivered 
a demand letter was sent  along with a detailed historical background on the events pertaining to these contracts 
mauna loa s attorneys responded by saying they were advising mauna loa not to pay 
the partnership filed suit for collection on december   and filed a motion for summary judgment 
the court heard the motion for summary judgment on february  the partnership s motion was neither granted nor declined  but rather  the court allowed a day discovery period before making its decision 
the motion for summary judgment is now scheduled for may  waterside partners on july   waterside partners  a limited partner  filed a suit asking that it be awarded its costs and expenses for prosecution of a lawsuit and a proxy contest related to a proposed merger involving the partnership 
a hearing was held on the motion for attorney s fees and expenses on january   and the court ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to any attorney fees or expenses 
the plaintiff appealed to the supreme court of delaware  which decided on november  to uphold the lower court ruling 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the partnership has market risk exposure on its credit agreement due to its variable rate pricing that is based on rates based on libor  the farm credit discount note rate and the farm credit medium term note rate 
as of september   a one percent increase or decrease in the applicable rate under the credit agreement will result in an interest expense fluctuation of approximately
