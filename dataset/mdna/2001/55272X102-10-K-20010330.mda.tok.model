general the company was incorporated in maryland on july   and began operations on april  on april   the company and three partnerships america first participating preferred equity mortgage fund limited partnership prep fund  america first prep fund limited partnership prep fund  america first prep fund pension series limited partnership pension fund  consummated a merger transaction whereby their pre existing net assets and operations or majority interest in the pre existing partnership were contributed to the company in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
for financial accounting purposes  prep fund  the largest of the three partnerships  was considered the predecessor entity the predecessor and its historical operating results are presented in the financial statements contained herein 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
prep fund was deemed to be the acquirer of the other partnerships under the purchase method 
accordingly  the merger resulted  for financial accounting purposes  in the effective purchase by prep fund of all the beneficial unit certificates bucs of prep fund and approximately of the bucs of pension fund 
pension fund was liquidated and dissolved during december  as the surviving entity for financial accounting purposes  the assets and liabilities of prep fund were recorded by the company at their historical cost and the assets and liabilities of prep fund and pension fund were adjusted to fair value 
the excess of the fair value of stock issued over the fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill in the accompanying balance sheet of the company 
concurrent with the merger  the company entered into an advisory agreement with america first mortgage advisory corporation the advisor and adopted an investment policy which significantly differed from that pursued by the predecessor partnerships 
this strategy includes leveraged investing in adjustable rate mortgage securities and mortgage loans 
the company began implementing this investment strategy in the second quarter of during the period from the consummation of the merger through december   the company purchased mortgage securities with a face value at the time of purchase of approximately million mortgage securities with a face value of approximately million were purchased during the year ended december  
the company has elected to become subject to tax as a real estate investment trust reit under the code beginning with its taxable year and  as such  anticipates distributing annually at least effective january  of its taxable income  subject to certain adjustments 
generally  cash for such distributions is expected to be largely generated from the company s operations  although the company may borrow funds to make distributions 
since the merger  the company has made dividend and distribution payments of  and per share for  and  respectively 
such amounts include per share distributed through the first year of operations ie through the first quarter of which the company committed to distribute to shareholders as part of the merger transaction 
a portion of distributions received by shareholders in and consisted in part of a dividend and in part of a cash merger payment 
there is no commitment by the company to distribute amounts in excess of taxable income beyond the first year of operations 
for tax purposes  a portion of the dividend declared on december   and paid on january   will be treated as a tax event for shareholders 
similarly  for tax purposes  the dividend declared on december   and paid on february   was treated in its entirety as a tax event for shareholders 
the company s operations for any period may be affected by a number of factors including the investment assets held  general economic conditions affecting underlying borrowers and  most significantly  factors which affect the interest rate market 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the merger  other related transactions and on going implementation of the change in investment strategy will materially impact the company s future operations as compared to those of the predecessor 
accordingly  the currently reported financial information is not necessarily indicative of the company s future operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of capital consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements  principal payments received on its portfolio of mortgage securities and cash provided by operations 
principal uses of cash include the acquisition of investment securities  the payment of operating expenses and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
during the year ended december   the company acquired mortgage securities  corporate debt securities and corporate equity securities for million 
financing for these acquisitions was provided primarily through the utilization of repurchase agreements  supplemented by cash flow from operations of million 
the company also received principal payments of million on its mortgage securities during and had proceeds of million from the sale of mortgage securities  corporate equity securities and corporate debt securities 
in addition  the company received proceeds of million from the sale of the underlying real estate of an unconsolidated real estate limited partnership 
such proceeds were reinvested in the real estate limited partnership and utilized to acquire another multifamily housing property 
other uses of funds in consisted of dividend payments of million and million for the acquisition of  shares of its own common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program as described below 
the company s borrowings under repurchase agreements totaled million at december   and had a weighted average borrowing rate of as of such date 
at december   the repurchase agreements had balances of between million and million 
these arrangements have original terms to maturity ranging from one month to twelve months and annual interest rates based on libor 
to date  the company has not had any significant margin calls on its repurchase agreements that were related to a decrease in the value of its collateral 
in connection with the company s  share repurchase program  the company purchased and retired  shares during the year ended december   at an aggregate cost of  since implementing the stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of  through december   the company has purchased and retired  shares at an aggregate cost of the company may raise additional equity dependent upon market conditions and other factors 
the company believes it has adequate financial resources to meet its obligations as they come due and fund dividends as well as to actively pursue its investment policy and share repurchase program 
results of operations year ended december   compared to during the year ended december   total interest income earned by the company increased million compared to total interest income earned in this increase is primarily attributable to a growth in the company s average interest earning assets from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also contributing to the increase was a growth in the yield on the company s interest earning assets from per annum in to per annum in the company s interest expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to due to a increase in the average repurchase agreement balance from million in to million in  as well as an increase in the average interest cost from per annum in to per annum in the company had outstanding borrowings of million at december  compared to million at december  the company s interest rate margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  as a result of the narrowing of such margin  net interest and dividend income decreased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income from other investments increased from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in such income for the year ended december  is a gain of approximately million which resulted from the sale of the underlying real estate of an unconsolidated real estate limited partnership 
included in such income for the year ended december  is approximately million attributable to a gain recognized by a non consolidated subsidiary s sale of its undivided interests in the net assets of four assisted living centers 
excluding such sales  income from other investments increased million due to higher income generated by the company s investments in unconsolidated real estate limited partnerships 
during the year ended december   the company realized a net gain of million on the sale of investments compared to a net gain of million during the year ended december  such gains resulted from the sale of corporate debt and equity securities and the sale and or payoff of several pools of fixed rate mortgage securities 
general and administrative expenses of the company decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of approximately million of such decrease is due to expenses incurred in by a consolidated subsidiary which was liquidated in december the remaining million decrease is primarily attributable to net decreases in various general and administrative expenses  including various servicing fees  filing fees and printing costs 
year ended december   compared to during the year ended december   total interest income earned by the company increased million compared to total interest income earned by the company and its predecessor in this increase is attributable to the growth in the company s interest earning assets pursuant to its investment strategy 
in addition  the yield on the company s interest earning assets increased from per annum in to per annum in the company s interest expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to an increase in funds borrowed to finance the company s asset growth 
the company had outstanding borrowings of million at december  compared to million at december  the company s interest cost averaged per annum in compared to per annum in the company s interest rate margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  income from other investments increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  approximately million of such increase is attributable to the sale by a non consolidated subsidiary of its undivided interests in the net assets of four assisted living centers 
the remaining decrease of approximately million is due to a reduction in the amount of income generated on the company s investments in real estate limited partnerships 
during the year ended december   the company realized a gain of million on the sale of investments whereas the company realized a gain of million during the comparable period in the majority of the gain realized in was due to the payoff of a participating loan acquired by the company in the merger 
general and administrative expenses of the company in increased million as compared to that of the company and the predecessor in approximately million of such increase is attributable to non recurring incentive compensation earned by the company s advisor as a result of the sale by a non consolidated subsidiary of its undivided interests in the net assets of four assisted living centers as described in note to the company s consolidated and combined financial statements 
the remaining increase of approximately million was due to i an increase of million in incentive compensation earned by the advisor due to the improved financial results of the company  and ii an increase of million in base management fees earned by the advisor primarily due to the company operating a full year in compared to operating approximately nine months in offset by iii a decrease of million in other general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to the difference in scope of the company s operations in compared to that of the company and predecessor in forward looking statements when used in this form k  in future sec filings or in press releases or other written or oral communications  the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the company cautions that such forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and that various factors including regional and national economic conditions  changes in levels of market interest rates  credit and other risks of lending and investment activities  and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the company s financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to shareholders to realize attractive total rates of return through stock ownership of the company 
while the company does not seek to avoid risk  it does seek  to the best of its ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks it does undertake 
interest rate risk the company primarily invests in fixed rate  hybrid and adjustable rate mortgage investments 
the hybrid investments represent fixed rate coupons for a given period and variable rate coupons thereafter 
the company s debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration which are periodically refinanced at new market rates 
most of the company s adjustable rate assets are dependent on the one year cmt rate and debt obligations are generally dependent on libor 
these indexes generally move in parallel  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
the company s adjustable rate investment assets and debt obligations reset at various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of the company s debt obligations occurs more quickly than on the company s assets 
therefore  on average  the company s cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does its earnings rate on the assets 
further  the company s net income may vary somewhat as the yield curve between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies 
as of december   the company s investment assets and debt obligations will prospectively reprice based on the following time frames assets debt obligations amount percent of amount percent of total total investments investments investment type rate reset dates fixed rate investments adjustable rate investments obligations less than months greater than months and less than year greater than year and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years greater than years and less than years total weighted average roll date of adjustable rate investments obligations months month market value risk substantially all of the company s investments are available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie market value with the adjustment to fair value reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income which is included in the equity section of the company s balance sheet 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the market value of the company s assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk of the company arises from financing long maturity mortgage assets with short term debt 
the company had no long term debt at december  although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are matched within the company s operating policies  maturities are not matched 
the company s assets which are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  the company has not had difficulty rolling over its short term debt as it matures 
still  the company cannot give assurances that it will always be able to roll over its short term debt 
at december   the company had unrestricted cash of million available to meet margin calls on short term debt that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender over collateralization requirements 
such unrestricted cash is approximately of short term debt 
prepayment risk as the company receives repayments of mortgage principal  it amortizes into income its mortgage premium balances as a reduction to income and its mortgage discount balances as an increase to income 
mortgage premium balances arise when the company acquires mortgage assets at a price in excess of the principal value of the mortgages  or when an asset appreciates and is marked to market at a price above par 
mortgage discount balances arise when the company acquires mortgage assets at a price below the principal value of the mortgages  or when an asset depreciates and is marked to market at a price below par 
for financial accounting purposes  the premium is amortized based on the effective yield of the asset at each financial reporting date 
for tax accounting purposes  the premium is amortized based on the asset yield at the purchase date 
therefore  if prepayments are higher than anticipated  it is anticipated that the yield for financial accounting purposes will decline and there will be greater premium amortization under tax accounting requirements than for financial accounting purposes 
at december   unamortized mortgage premium balances of adjustable rate assets for financial accounting purposes was million of total assets and million for federal tax purposes of total assets 
in general  the company believes it will be able to reinvest prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds reinvested 
tabular presentation the information presented in the table below  projects the impact of changes in interest rates on projected net income and net assets as more fully discussed below based on investments in place on december   and includes all the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company acquires interest rate sensitive assets and funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the company generally plans to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
the table below includes information about the possible future repayments and interest rates of the company s assets and liabilities and constitutes a forward looking statement 
there are many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as assumed or that other events will occur that would affect the outcomes 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change the company s interest rate risk profile 
the table quantifies the potential changes in net income should interest rates go up or down shocked by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
the cash flows associated with the adjustable rate securities for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions  including prepayment vectors  repurchase rates  repurchase haircuts  yield on reinvestment of prepayment  and growth in the portfolio 
when interest rates are shocked  these prepayment assumptions are further adjusted based on management s best estimate of the effects of changes on interest rates or prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of the arm portfolio 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
as of december   all interest rate sensitive liabilities were scheduled to mature in change in percentage change percentage change interest rates in net income in net assets
