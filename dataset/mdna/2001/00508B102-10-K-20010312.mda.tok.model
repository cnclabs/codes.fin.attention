license fee revenues from sales of software products directly to end user customers are recognized as revenue after execution of a license agreement or receipt of a definitive purchase order and shipment of the product  fees are fixed or determinable  provided no vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivables is deemed probable 
our products do not require significant customization 
the majority of license fee revenues from direct sales to end user customers is from sales of specific individual products to such customers and is recognized upon shipment of the applicable product 
advance payments from end user customers  in arrangements in which the end user customer has the right to future unspecified products  are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated term of the period  typically one year  during which the end user is entitled to receive the products 
license arrangements with end user customers generally give the customer a perpetual license to use our software  are terminable by either party in the event of a material breach of the license agreement by the other party if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period  contain certain representations  warranties and indemnities and provisions designed to limit the parties liability under the license agreement

business application vendor s sell through 
service revenues are primarily comprised of revenue from maintenance agreements  consulting and training fees 
revenue from maintenance agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis as service revenue over the term of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
service revenues from consulting and training services are recognized upon completion of the work to be performed 
to date we have sold our products internationally primarily through our subsidiaries in europe and japan 
during  and  we derived  and of our total revenues  respectively  from sales outside north america 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in increasing revenues from international sales 
although we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america and to enter additional international markets  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
in order to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international distributors and increase the productivity of existing international distributors 
if we are not successful in expanding international operations in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult and unreliable 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license fees services total revenues cost of revenues license fees services total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss revenues our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues for any of the periods presented 
license fees 
revenues from license fees increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal the increases were due primarily to increased sales to new customers and increased follow on sales to existing customers and  to a lesser extent  increase in average selling prices for our products 
revenues from license fees from our indirect channel partners  including e 
business application vendors  resellers and distributors  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for  and  respectively 
services 
revenues from services increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and by to million in fiscal the increase in was due to increases in consulting revenues as a result of our acquisition of ost  and increases in maintenance and support related to increases in our installed customer base 
cost of revenues license fees 
cost of revenues from license fees consists primarily of product packaging  documentation and production costs  and localization of our software for international distribution 
cost of revenues from license fees decreased from million  or of revenues from license fees  in to  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal and increased to million  or of revenues from license fees  in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in existing customers purchasing additional licenses in which no shipments were required 
the decrease in cost of license fees revenues as a percentage of license fees revenues in fiscal was due to improved leverage in production and personnel costs and increases in the average selling price of our software 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to packaging and production costs to support increased sales  and  to lesser extent  increased localization expense and royalty fees paid for embedded third party technologies 
we expect cost of revenues from license fees to continue to grow in absolute dollars due to increasing licensing activity 
services 
cost of services revenues consists primarily of personnel and related costs  facilities costs incurred in providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
cost of services revenues increased from million  or of services revenues  in fiscal to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal and to million  or of services revenues  in fiscal the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of services revenues in fiscal was due to efficiency and economies of scale 
the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to increases in customer support personnel obtained in the ost acquisition and increased third party costs to support the growing needs of our customers 
the increase in cost of services as a percentage of services revenues in fiscal was due to integration costs relating to our acquisition of ost and building the infrastructure to support our growing service organizations 
we expect cost of services to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we continue to hire additional customer support personnel and consultants to support our customers demand for our services 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  promotional expenses  travel and facility expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by from million in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  higher sales commissions associated with increased revenues and increased marketing activities the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due to revenues increasing at a faster rate than sales and marketing expenses 
we expect that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel  establish additional sales offices  expand international distribution channels and increase promotional activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing

the decreases in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were due to revenues increasing at a faster rate than research and development expenses 
we believe that a significant level of investment in product development is essential to maintain product leadership and anticipates research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods for developing new products and providing enhancements to current products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for finance  human resources  information systems and general management  as well as legal and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by from million in fiscal to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal and by to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increases in personnel and related costs and professional fees necessary to manage and support our growth and facilities expansion 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional personnel to support expanded operations 
deferred compensation 
we recorded deferred compensation aggregating  in and these amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants 
there was no deferred compensation in and in fiscal  and  we recorded amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively 
all deferred compensation expense has been included in general and administrative expenses 
at december   we have approximately  remaining to be amortized over the corresponding vesting period of each respective option  generally five years 
upon cancellation of the underlying stock options  the unamortized portion has been offset against additional paid in capital 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
in connection with the acquisition of bv in june  we recognized million in goodwill and identified intangible assets 
in addition  we recognized million in goodwill and identified intangible assets in our acquisition of ost in february and million in goodwill and identified intangible assets in our acquisition of enterprisesoft in march in april  we purchased additional shares of actuate japan and became the majority shareholder 
we recognized million in goodwill as a result of consolidating actuate japan s financial statements 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill and identified intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods not exceeding four years 
in fiscal and  we recorded amortization expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
approximately million remains to be amortized 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  is comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income  net  increased from a net income of  in fiscal to million in fiscal  and decreased to  in fiscal the increase in was due to interest income earned on investment from net proceeds from our initial public offering in july the decrease in was due to lower interest income on a lower average annual investment base as we used cash to purchase ost  enterprisesoft and shares of actuate japan 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes on our pretax income was and in fiscal and  respectively 
we incurred losses prior to and no provision for income taxes was recorded 
in general  our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of largely as a function of benefits realized from prior years losses 
the increase of the effective tax rate as compared to the effective tax rate was primarily due to non deductible acquisition costs and goodwill amortization expenses related to corporate merger and acquisitions completed in fiscal liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through approximately million in net proceeds from the private sales of preferred stock  million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in july  and cash from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in fiscal and  we generated positive cash flow of million and million  respectively  from operating activities  and used  in cash in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in fiscal  cash was used primarily to purchase property and equipment for our newly relocated and expanded facilities in south san francisco  and for our acquisition of ost  which was offset by proceeds from maturity of short term investments 
in fiscal  cash was used primarily in the acquisition of bv and purchase of short term investments 
in fiscal  cash was used primarily for purchase of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal cash from financing activities in fiscal and primarily reflects the net proceeds from the exercise of options under our stock option plan and purchases of common stock under our stock purchase plan 
cash from financing activities in fiscal primarily reflect net proceeds from sales of common stock issued during the initial public offering 
we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity or obtain credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our japanese distributor  or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
recently issued accounting pronouncement in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  will be effective from our fiscal year this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial statements as we currently do not utilize derivative instruments 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab summarizes certain areas of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we adopted sab in our fiscal quarter beginning january  we believe that our current revenue recognition policy complies with sab the adoption of sab did not result in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb no 
 or fin fin clarifies the application of apb no 
and  among other issues  clarifies the following the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of the previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the application of fin has not had a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  and  we derived  and of our total revenues  respectively  from sales outside the united states 
approximately of the revenues from our us operations are overseas sales and are denominated in us dollars 
our exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies is limited 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country and may result in a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in was not material 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
