item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  the description of the company s business operations  and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of the matters discussed in this annual report contain forward looking statements regarding the company s future business that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including competitive pressures  adverse economic conditions and government regulations 
these issues  and other factors  which may be identified from time to time in the company s reports filed with the sec  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
in a restructuring of ffp partners motivated by federal income tax considerations and completed on december   the company acquired  as its initial assets  all of the assets and businesses formerly held by ffp partners  except that ffp partners retained the real estate used in the retail operations 
ffp partners also retained certain liabilities  principally bank debt and debt secured by the retained real estate 
all other obligations of ffp partners such as trade accounts payable  money orders payable  accrued expenses  deferred income taxes  obligations under capital leases and other debt secured by various equipment were transferred to the company 
the businesses transferred to the company include the operation of convenience stores  truck stops  and self service motor fuel concessions at independently operated convenience stores  motor fuel wholesaling activities  the sale of money orders through the outlets operated by the company and third party agents  and the operation of a motor fuel terminal and processing facility 
the real estate retained by ffp partners is leased to the company for use in the conduct of its retail convenience store and motor fuel operations 
the selected financial data that accompanies this discussion reflects the historical operations of ffp partners to which the company succeeded in connection with the aforementioned restructuring 
the financial data for years prior to is not considered comparable to subsequent years in the following respects rental expense for real properties retained by ffp partners in the december restructuring was incurred in  and  but not in prior years  depreciation expense related to such real properties was not incurred for  and  but was incurred in prior years  and interest income received by the company from its note receivable from ffp partners was included in and  but not in years prior to that note was repaid in full in october also in december  the company purchased convenience stores 
fourteen of the stores were sold to unrelated parties almost immediately thereafter  resulting in a net increase of stores 
the company also acquired additional convenience stores and truck stops in february the results from operations from these stores have had a positive impact on operating results and are expected to continue to have a similar impact in future years 
the company reports its results of operations using a fiscal year that ends on the last sunday in december 
most fiscal years have weeks  but some consist of weeks 
fiscal years though were week years  while fiscal year was a week year 
this variation in time periods most affects revenues and related costs of sales and salary costs  as other expenses such as rent and utilities are usually recorded on a monthly basis 
however  differences in the number of weeks in a fiscal year should be considered in reviewing the financial data 
business segments the company and its subsidiaries conduct business in two primary business segments i the operation of retail convenience stores  truck stops  and motor fuel concessions at independently operated convenience stores  money orders sales through company stores and third party agents  underground tank monitoring and testing  and motor fuel wholesaling activities the retail and wholesale operations  and ii the operation of a motor fuel terminal and processing facility the terminal operations 
each of these business segments is subject to differing opportunities and challenges

the acquisition of any additional stores will be dependent upon whether acceptable purchase prices  terms and properties can be found 
the company intends to continue implementing its strategy of selling converting certain of its company operated convenience stores to independent third party operators and continuing such outlets as gas only stores 
the company has targeted an additional company operated stores as suitable candidates for such transactions and will continue to search for qualified purchasers for these locations 
the company will endeavor to continue its improved operating performance at the terminal in income before income taxes from terminal operations improved to  in  reflecting a  improvement over a net loss before taxes in terminal operations of  gross revenues from terminal operations also increased significantly in to  before eliminating inter company sales of  compared to only  in before eliminating inter company sales of  a increase 
this improved performance principally resulted from increased volumes of motor fuel sales after the terminal was connected in fall to a motor fuel pipeline originating at the texas gulf coast 
in  the terminal operations were greatly expanded with a fuel blending operation at the terminal 
for this processing  the company purchases refined fuel products in much greater quantities and takes delivery via a pipeline from the texas gulf coast having a portal at the company s terminal 
the company then adds blend stock to the fuel  creating more volume  and resells the resulting products on a wholesale basis to its own retail stores and to third parties 
one of the key ingredients in the blending process at the terminal is natural gasoline  which greatly increased in price and became uneconomical during as a result  the blending operation at the terminal will be replaced with transmix processing for most of the operating results of this change cannot be assured 
as in past years  the company will seek new sources of revenue in at its store locations  its gas only stores  and locations that sell its money orders 
in so doing  the company will attempt to capitalize on its network of retail locations serving customers in small towns and larger cities in several states 
compared with the company earned net income of  in  a substantial improvement  over a net loss of  in major reasons for the improvement in earnings in  compared to  included the following o gross margins from motor fuel sales increased by  in o miscellaneous revenues rose by  in  with the major elements of that improvement being gain on sale conversion of convenience stores to gas only stores and net realized gain on sale of marketable securities  offset in part by net unrealized loss on marketable securities  net loss on fuel trading  and net loss from a aircraft jet fuel joint venture  and o extraordinary losses of   after taxes had been incurred in in connection with loan refinancing 
the company incurred a comprehensive loss in of  comprised of its net income of  minus a net unrealized loss on available for sale securities  after tax  of  in  the company s net loss equaled its comprehensive loss because it did not own any available for sale securities in the company s total revenues topped million dollars for the first time in total revenues increased to  in  a increase over total revenues of  total revenues increased primarily as a result of higher motor fuel sales prices  sales for an entire year at the stores acquired in february  and additional gallons of wholesale motor fuel sales at the terminal 
this increase in total revenues is broken down as follows increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages motor fuel sales    merchandise sales    miscellaneous revenues   total revenues    motor fuel sales increased to  in  an improvement of  compared to  in a breakdown showing the major components of this increase is shown in the table below increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages retail motor fuel sales convenience stores    gas only outlets    truck stops    total retail    wholesales motor fuel sales    terminal motor fuel sales    other motor fuel sales    total motor fuel sales    the gross margin from motor fuel sales also increased in to  an improvement of  compared to the gross margin of  gross margins increased in as a result of selling a much greater number of gallons at a higher average margin per gallon 
the major area of operations where additional motor fuel margins were earned was at the terminal 
a breakdown showing the major components of this increase is shown in the table below increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages retail motor fuel margin convenience stores   gas only outlets    truck stops   total retail   wholesales motor fuel margin   terminal motor fuel margin    other motor fuel margin total motor fuel margin    in gallons  the company sold  gallons of motor fuel in  an increase of  gallons compared to  gallons sold in retail motor fuel sales declined by  gallons to  gallons in  a decrease from sales of  gallons 
the decrease resulted principally from increased competition for retail sales 
wholesale motor fuel sales excluding sales at the terminal decreased in to  gallons  compared to  gallons in  a slight decrease of  
motor fuel sales to third parties at the terminal increased in from  gallons in to  gallons in  a large increase of  
this increase was obtained because the tie in of a pipeline transporting motor fuel from the texas gulf coast in fall of allowed additional fuel to be sold at the terminal for an entire year in these sales are highlighted in the following table increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages gallons sold retail    wholesale    terminal    other    total gallons sold    merchandise sales in were  a slight decrease compared to  in this  decrease occurred primarily as a result of the sale conversion of company operated convenience stores to gas only stores because the company does not sell merchandise at its gas only stores 
cigarette sales increased by as a result of the pass through of cigarette price increases caused by litigation against cigarette manufacturers 
average weekly merchandise sales per convenience store increased from  per convenience store in to  per convenience store in  a increase 
major categories of merchandise sales in the last two years were as follows increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages grocery sales    deli  fast food  and restaurant sales    soft drinks sales    beer and wine sales   cigarette sales    money order supplies and equipment sales tank monitoring equipment sales total merchandise sales    the company s gross profit on merchandise sales decreased to  in  a  decline from the merchandise gross profit of  this decrease primarily came from the reduced number of convenience stores in  but that was partially offset by additional merchandise gross profit realized from months of operations at the stores acquired in february and a slight increase in gross margin percentage on merchandise sales to in  compared to in miscellaneous revenues increased in to  a  increase compared to primary reasons were miscellaneous income in from the following sources with amounts in parenthesis gain on sale conversion of company operated stores  realized gains on sales of marketable securities  bond discount accretion  and money order sales income  offset in part by unrealized losses on marketable securities  fuel trading losses  and losses from an aircraft fuel joint venture 
miscellaneous revenues is one area of operations that the company emphasizes in its efforts to improve profitability 
direct store expenses those costs directly attributable to the operation of retail outlets  such as salaries and other personnel costs  supplies  utilities  rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance  and commissions paid to the operators of gas only stores decreased slightly by  in  compared to direct store expenses in this decrease occurred primarily as a consequence of the sale conversion in of company operated stores to gas only stores  which required lesser direct store expenses and offset a general rise in labor costs at company operated convenience stores 
general and administrative expenses increased by  in when compared to primary reasons for the increase were an increase in labor costs  additional legal and professional fees  and partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expenses 
bad debt expense was reduced by  in  compared to  as a result of the company s victory in litigation to recover certain money order bad debts previously written off in depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  in  reflecting depreciation of capital expenditures incurred by the company in the last few years  primarily related to depreciation of new gasoline pumps and inside equipment at certain company stores  depreciation of equipment acquired in the acquisition of convenience stores in february  depreciation of buildings obtained under transactions accounted for as capital leases in february  and amortization expense of financing costs incurred in february and december interest expense increased by  in  as compared to  as a result of borrowing under the company s revolving credit facility during the year 
additional borrowings have been necessitated because the company prepays certain purchases of motor fuel prior to that fuel being transported in a pipeline from the texas gulf coast to the terminal and because increased motor fuel prices result in higher inventory and trade receivable balances to be financed until they are collected 
interest income rose in by   compared to  primarily as a result of interest income earned on investments in corporate bonds  money market funds  an investment in a joint venture  which was terminated in early  and other liquid investments during in the company had earned interest income on its note receivable from ffp partners until it was repaid in october  and in interest income earned from marketable securities made up for that loss in interest income from the note receivable 
compared with the company incurred a loss before extraordinary items of  in  and a net loss of  in  compared to net loss of  in major reasons for the increased loss were the following gross margins from motor fuel retail sales decreased by cent per gallon in  interest expense increased by  in  and an extraordinary loss of   after taxes was incurred in connection with the refinancing as a result of writing off loan costs and paying prepayment penalties 
the company s total revenues topped the half billion dollars for the first time in  as total revenues increased to  a increase over total revenues of  total revenues increased as a result of higher pricing of motor fuel and cigarettes and increased sales resulting from the additional stores acquired in february this  increase in total revenues is broken down as follows increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages motor fuel sales    merchandise sales    miscellaneous revenues    total revenues    retail motor fuel sales increased by  gallons in over due to sales from the additional convenience stores acquired in february in addition  wholesale fuel sales increased by  gallons over the prior year 
total motor fuel sales  in dollars  increased by  in to  a improvement compared to  in the gross margin from motor fuel sales also increased in to  but only by increase compared to the gross margin of  gross margins also increased in as a result of the additional stores acquired in february and higher fuel prices in the company sold more motor fuel volume in  which offset a gross margin per gallon decline 
retail margins showed a cent per gallon decrease in compared to and was principally attributable to lower margins in the areas served by competing stores and truck stops 
wholesale per gallon margins were the same in when compared to  while the total wholesale gallons sold increased by 
for the first time  the company earned a margin on fuel sold from the terminal  cents per gallon margin on  gallons  calculated before reduction for inter company sales 
in addition  the motor fuel mix between retail sales and wholesale sales influenced the decline in per gallon margins 
retail motor fuel sales  which have higher per gallon margins than wholesale  declined from of total motor fuel sales in to in a breakdown showing the company s  increase in fuel sales is shown in the table below increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages retail motor fuel sales convenience stores    gas only outlets    truck stops    total retail    wholesale motor fuel sales    terminal motor fuel sales    other motor fuel sales   n a total motor fuel sales    merchandise sales improved to  in  a increase compared to  in this  increase resulted principally from a store increase in the average number of convenience stores operated in and higher cigarettes prices 
average weekly merchandise sales per convenience store increased by in to  per convenience store

miscellaneous revenues increased by in to  representing a  increase as compared to  primarily due to the greater number of stores in operation for the full year 
primary reasons for the increase were miscellaneous income in from the following sources realized  unrealized and discount income from trading securities  income from beverage agreement  lottery ticket revenue  and income from aircraft fuel joint venture  offset in part by there being no gain on asset disposition as in the prior year 
miscellaneous revenues is one area of operations that the company emphasizes in its efforts to improve profitability 
direct store expenses those costs directly attributable to the operation of retail outlets  such as salaries and other personnel costs  supplies  utilities  rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance  and commissions paid to the operators of the self service motor fuel outlets increased by  in  compared to direct store expenses in this increase was primarily attributable to the stores acquired in february general and administrative expenses decreased by  in compared to the primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in bad debt expense because the company had in incurred bad debts of  arising out its money order operations 
the company initiated litigation to recover those bad debts and recovered a substantial portion in depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  in reflecting the significant capital expenditures incurred by the company in the last few years  primarily related to the upgrading of the company s underground storage tanks to meet environmental regulatory requirements  the start of operations at the company s fuel terminal in mid  depreciation of equipment acquired in the acquisitions of convenience stores made in december and in february  and depreciation of buildings obtained under transactions accounted for as capital leases in february a  increase in interest expense in  as compared to  resulted primarily from additional long term debt incurred in and partially from higher interest rates in as a result of increasing interest rates in the past year  the company pursued long term fixed rate financing for a larger component in its capital structure 
most of the new debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of convenience stores in and convenience stores and truck stops in february the company s liquidity improved considerably in and is expected to allow the company to expand its retail  wholesale and terminal operations 
interest income rose significantly in by   compared to  primarily as a result of interest income earned on increasing investments in money market funds and other liquid investments during liquidity and capital resources the majority of the company s working capital is provided from three sources i liquid  short term investments  ii cash flows generated from its operating activities  and ii borrowings under its revolving line of credit facility 
the company believes that these investments  operating activities  and short term working capital facilities  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund current commitments for operating and capital expenditure programs  as well as to service debt requirements 
actual capital expenditures will be dependent on the level of cash flow generated from operating activities and the funds available from financings 
the company s notes payable at the end of and were  and  as summarized in the table below type of loan purpose of loan in thousands store note financing of gas only conversion sewer financing truck stop improvements vendor financing accounting software short term note investment in private company year financing purchase of stores   year financing purchase of stores year financing refinancing of bank debt   bank line of credit operations  total notes payable   less short term portion   long term notes payable   in june  the company refinanced its december purchase of convenience stores 
that financing consisted of fully amortizing loans in the aggregate original principal amount of  an interest rate fixed at per annum  maturity dates ranging from to months  and aggregate payments of principal and interest of  per month 
in june  the company refinanced all of its prior bank revolving credit facility and term loan and an equipment financing note 
that financing consisted of fully amortizing loans in the aggregate original principal amount of  an interest rate fixed at per annum  maturity date in months  and aggregate payments of principal and interest of  per month 
the company has utilized the loan proceeds to repay the above described loans and for general corporate purposes 
in october  ffp partners repaid all of its indebtedness of  then owed to the company and the company  in turn  repaid all of its debt of  to ffp partners 
the company had incurred that debt in february to purchase inventory and equipment at stores purchased by ffp partners and leased to the company at that time 
in december  the company obtained a revolving line of credit from a bank providing for borrowings of up to  with the amount available at any time limited to a borrowing base equal to of certain of its trade receivables plus of its inventory at the terminal  provided  however  that any amounts which would cause outstanding borrowings under the facility to exceed  are limited to of the net value of marketable securities from time to time in the company s trading account at a brokerage firm 
the net value at the brokerage firm was  at december  on that date  the borrowing base under the revolver was the lesser of a of certain of its trade receivables plus of its inventory at the terminal totaling  or b  the amount outstanding under the facility on that date was  the revolving credit facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus one percentage point  payable monthly on amounts borrowed  and matures in december the loans are subject to a loan agreement and a security agreement between the lender  the company and two subsidiaries of the company 
the agreement contains numerous  but typical  restrictive covenants including a financial covenant relating to the maintenance of a specified fixed charge coverage ratio of to  all as defined in the agreement 
the loan is secured by all of the company s trade accounts receivables and its inventory at the terminal 
the company is pursuing in the first quarter of  and has obtained a proposal for  a new revolving credit facility with another bank to provide for borrowings of up to  with the amount available at any time limited to a borrowing base equal to a percentage of its of certain of its trade receivables plus a percentage of its inventory at the terminal 
the company currently anticipates closing this new facility in the second quarter of and terminating its current revolving credit facility  which could require the payment of prepayment penalties 
under the proposal  the new facility would bear interest at either a the lender s floating prime rate plus one half percentage point  or b the floating libor rate plus basis points 
the loans would be payable monthly on amounts borrowed and mature in three years 
the loans would be subject to loan and security agreements  not yet negotiated  between the lender and two operating subsidiaries of the company  and be guaranteed by the company and its other subsidiaries 
the agreement will contain numerous  but typical  restrictive covenants including financial covenants not yet negotiated 
the loan will be secured by the company s trade receivables and its inventory at the terminal and its store locations 
when the company operated as a publicly traded limited partnership prior to  it made cash distributions to its partners from time to time to provide funds for them to pay income taxes on the company s income that was allocated to them 
with the change in the company s tax status to a corporation and the corporate emphasis on growth  management does not currently anticipate that any dividends will be paid on the company s common stock in the foreseeable future 
the company s cash balances at year end were  cash flows used in operating activities in were  primarily reflected in the increase in trade receivables  the receipt of interest bearing notes receivable in connection with the sale conversion of convenience stores to gas only stores  and a reduction in accrued expenses 
additional cash is now required to fund increased purchases of inventory for the terminal  often payable in advance of pipeline shipments to the terminal  and trade receivables on wholesale sales  which increased significantly during as a result of substantially higher motor fuel prices 
increases in trade receivables affect liquidity  even if the transactions giving rise to such receivables are profitable 
net cash flows used in investing activities were  in the principal component was capital expenditures for store and equipment improvements at company stores  new gasoline pumps and other equipment  and a pipeline connection at the terminal 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were  in  primarily from borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility at the end of the year  partially reduced by payments on long term obligations 
subject to obtaining satisfactory deal terms  in the company intends to increase significantly the outright sales of its convenience stores and or the sales of its convenience store to independent operators while retaining a motor fuel concession at those locations 
it has identified additional convenience stores that it will attempt to sell convert to gas only stores in such a manner 
the company will look for  but may not purchase  additional convenience stores to purchase in and beyond as the convenience store industry goes through as period of greater competition and consolidation 
any such acquisitions and dispositions could impact the company s financial results and liquidity 
the company is party to commodity futures contracts and forward contracts to buy and sell fuel  both of which are used principally to satisfy balances owed on exchange agreements 
both of these types of contracts have off balance sheet risk as they involve the risk of dealing with others and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts and the risk associated with unmatched positions and market fluctuations 
the open positions under these contracts were not significant at the end of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
over the last few years  the company s money order sales have increased significantly 
for example  money order payables at the end of were  compared to money order payables of  at the end of money order payables represent those sales of money orders for which the payee of the money order has not yet requested payment 
the company collects money order receipts on a daily basis on sales of money orders made by its own stores and relies on receiving timely payment from its third party money order sales agents 
the company s failure to receive money order payments on a timely basis from its money order agents could negatively impact the company s liquidity 
the company s working capital at the end of was  compared to  at the end of  an improvement of  
in past years  the company has been able to operate its business with minimal or negative working capital  principally because most of its sales are cash sales and it has received payment terms from vendors 
the need to prepay for pipeline fuel purchases for the terminal does require the company to maintain greater liquidity than before such pipeline purchases began 
the improvement in working capital resulted primarily from an increase in trade receivables  as illustrated in the following table in thousands additional trade receivables  reduced accrued expenses  reduced accounts payable  reduced cash and cash equivalents  additional money order payables  other items total change in working capital  the company believes that the availability of funds from its short term investments  store operations  its new revolving line of credit as discussed above  and its traditional use of trade credit will permit operations to be conducted in a customary manner 
inflation and seasonality the company believes that inflation can have a material effect on operating results 
one example is the upward pressure placed on wages caused by a low unemployment and a robust economy and  for store wages  by the federal minimum wage increases 
increased costs of motor fuel and merchandise can often be quickly reflected in higher prices to customers  but higher prices tend to reduce the demand for products 
the company s cost and prices for motor fuel increased significantly in as a result of a significant increase in the prices charged for refined fuel products  which in turn was caused by a significant increase in crude oil prices 
in addition  the cost of natural gasoline  an additive used in at the terminal in blending processes has greatly increased such that that particular blending process will most likely not be used at the terminal in as a result  operations at the terminal could be less profitable in than in management cannot make accurate predictions as to future increases in fuel or merchandise prices or in consumer demand for those products 
significant increases in the retail price of motor fuels tend to reduce fuel demand and the company s gross profit on fuel sales  reduce merchandise sales as fewer customers stop to purchase motor fuel  result in larger write offs of any bad debts on wholesale motor fuel sales that are not considered collectible  raise the possibility that third party operators of convenience stores and money order sales agents will become more likely to default in paying their obligations to the company  and raise financing costs to carry accounts receivable and inventories 
the company s businesses are normally subject to seasonal influences  with higher sales being experienced in the second and third quarters of the year as customers tend to purchase more motor fuel and convenience items  such as soft drinks  other beverages  and snack items  during the warmer months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risks related to variable interest rates and commodity prices 
the interest rate calculated under the company s line of credit facility is based on the prime rate of interest  which is subject to change and exposes the company to the possibility of increasing interest rates 
the company was obligated in the amount of  under that facility at the end of all of the company s other obligations at the end of were not subject to interest rate risk because such borrowings contain fixed rate financing 
the company s investments in marketable securities are also subject to risks related to interest rate increases  but the potential affect of such risks cannot be quantified with certainty 
the company is also subject to the market risk of increasing commodity prices and sometimes attempts to hedge that risk by purchasing commodity futures and forward contracts 
an attempt to mitigate that risk is subject to risk because the commodities subject to a futures contract are not the same commodities as those owned by the company in its business 
open positions under these futures and forward contracts were not significant at the end of or see note to the consolidated financial statements
