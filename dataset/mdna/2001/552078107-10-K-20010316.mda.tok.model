item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview general on march   lyondell completed the sale of the polyols business and ownership interests in its us po manufacturing operations to bayer for approximately billion 
as part of the transaction  lyondell and bayer entered into the po joint venture  a us po manufacturing joint venture  and the separate po technology joint venture  a joint venture with respect to certain related po sm technology 
lyondell recorded a million after tax gain on the sale 
during  total debt of billion was retired  primarily using net proceeds of the sale 
in addition  on december   lyondell and bayer formed a separate joint venture for the construction of the previously announced world scale po sm plant  known as po  located in rotterdam  the netherlands 
lyondell s operating income includes the intermediate chemicals and derivatives ic d business segment  consisting of the business acquired from arco chemical  prospectively from august  lyondell s activity in the petrochemicals  polymers and refining business segments is conducted through its interests in equistar and lcr 
the methanol business conducted through lmc is not a reportable segment for financial disclosure purposes 
lyondell accounts for its investments in equistar  lcr and lmc using the equity method of accounting 
net income net income of million in compares to a net loss of million in and net income of million in each year was affected by unusual items at lyondell  equistar and lcr as follows for the year ended december  in millions net income loss add deduct gains on asset sales extraordinary losses other unusual items adjusted net income loss net income for included a million after tax gain on the sale of assets to bayer and a million extraordinary loss on early debt retirement 
the net loss for included lyondell s million after tax share of an equistar gain on asset sale  a million extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt  an after tax  lifo related charge of million and lyondell s million after tax share of equistar restructuring and lcr renegotiated labor agreement charges 
earnings for included unusual charges of million after tax  related to the arco chemical acquisition  the renegotiated labor agreement at lcr and the formation of equistar 
the million increase in adjusted net income to million in from the adjusted net loss of million in was primarily due to lower net interest expense and higher equity earnings from equistar and lcr 
these benefits were partly offset by lower operating income for the ic d business segment 
the decrease in net interest expense reflected the retirement of billion of debt during  primarily using net proceeds of the sale to bayer 
equistar operating results improved due to higher petrochemicals margins in the increase in lcr operating results reflected higher deliveries and a more favorable mix of crude oil under the crude supply agreement 
the decrease in operating income for the ic d business was primarily due to the sale of the polyols business and lower margins for po and derivatives  partly offset by higher margins and volumes for mtbe and sm 
the million decrease from adjusted net income of million in to the adjusted net loss of million in was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower equity income from lcr and  to a lesser extent  from equistar 
the increase in interest expense reflected a full year of interest on debt related to the acquisition of arco chemical on july  this was only partly offset by the inclusion of a full year of operating income of the acquired business  which was included prospectively from august  lcr equity income decreased due to reduced deliveries and a less favorable mix of crude oil under the crude supply agreement  lower margins on crude oil purchased on the spot market and production unit outages in equistar equity income decreased primarily due to lower polymers margins  which reflected higher raw material costs in results of operations lyondell chemical company revenues  operating costs and expenses lyondell s operating results are reviewed in the discussion of the ic d segment below 
gain on sale of assets in  lyondell sold the polyols business and ownership interests in its us po manufacturing operations to bayer for approximately billion 
as part of the transaction  lyondell and bayer entered into the po joint venture and the separate po technology joint venture 
including post closing adjustments  the sale of assets to bayer generated a pretax gain of million  or million after tax 
unusual charges unusual charges  before tax  of million in primarily consisted of the write off of million of costs assigned to in process research and development in connection with the arco chemical acquisition 
income from equity investment in equistar lyondell s income from its equity investment in equistar was million in  million in and million in operationally  the increase of million from to was due to higher petrochemicals margins  which were partly offset by lower polymers margins 
in the petrochemicals segment  sales prices for ethylene increased more than costs for raw materials  leading to higher margins  primarily in the first nine months of in the polymers segment  margins were lower as sales price increases lagged behind raw material cost increases 
in the fourth quarter  margins in both segments were negatively affected by rapid increases in natural gas costs  which caused raw material and utility costs to increase  and a decline in sales prices due to decreased demand 
lyondell s equity income from equistar was also negatively affected by its share of restructuring and other unusual charges of million  which was partly offset by its share of gains on asset sales of million 
the decrease of million from to reflected lyondell s pretax share of equistar s restructuring and other unusual charges  which were million in compared to million in  as well as lower polymers margins  higher general and administrative expenses  and higher interest expense 
these were only partly offset by higher petrochemicals sales volumes and lyondell s share of gains on asset sales of million 
income from equity investment in lcr lyondell s income from its equity investment in lcr was million in  million in and million in the increase of million from to was primarily due to increased deliveries and an improved mix of crude oil under the crude supply agreement in the latter half of and higher margins on spot crude oil 
the higher spot margins primarily reflected a stronger gasoline market in although included a major planned turnaround  the effect was more than offset by the impact of unplanned production unit outages during the decrease of million from to was primarily due to reduced deliveries and a less favorable mix of crude oil under the crude supply agreement  lower spot margins  and the effects of the production unit outages in the second quarter interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in was principally due to the retirement of billion of debt  primarily using net proceeds from the sale to bayer 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to a full year of interest on debt related to the arco chemical acquisition on july  interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in reflected higher cash balances for part of the year as a result of proceeds from the asset sale to bayer 
income tax the effective tax rate  including extraordinary items  was a provision of in  compared to a benefit of in and a provision of in the tax rate of reflects  in part  the federal tax benefit from a restructuring of lyondell s european operations after the bayer transaction  primarily in the netherlands  and the attendant recognition of certain foreign exchange translation losses 
lyondell s income tax benefit was a result of the federal income tax benefit from a domestic loss incurred in  which was partially offset by tax provisions in foreign jurisdictions 
the higher effective tax rate in compared to a statutory rate of was due to lyondell s inability to claim foreign tax credits and limitations on the use of net operating losses for state tax purposes 
extraordinary items the extraordinary items for consisted of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and amendment fees of million and the payment of call premiums of million 
the total of million  or million after tax  related to the early retirement of billion of debt  primarily using net proceeds from the bayer asset sale 
the extraordinary item consisted of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and amendment fees totaling million  or million after tax  related to early retirement and partial refinancing of billion of debt 
during may  lyondell issued billion of fixed rate debt  billion of variable rate debt and million shares of common stock  using the net proceeds to reduce variable rate debt by a net billion 
pro forma on march   lyondell completed the sale of the polyols business and ownership interests in its us po manufacturing operations to bayer for approximately billion in cash 
the following condensed income statements present the unaudited pro forma consolidated operating results for and as if the transaction had occurred as of the beginning of and  respectively 
the pro forma income statements assume that net proceeds of billion were used to retire debt in accordance with the provisions of lyondell s credit facility and indentures as of the beginning of each period 
the operating results for exclude the after tax gain on the asset sale of million  or per share 
for the year ended december  in millions  except per share data sales and other operating revenues   operating income interest expense income from equity investments net income loss from continuing operations basic and diluted income loss per share from continuing operations 

the unaudited pro forma data presented above are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations of lyondell that would have occurred had such transactions actually been consummated as of the indicated dates  nor are they necessarily indicative of future results 
fourth quarter versus third quarter for the fourth quarter  lyondell reported a net loss before extraordinary item of million 
for the third quarter  lyondell s net income was million  excluding a post closing adjustment of the gain on the bayer asset sale and the effect of revising the income tax rate for the first six months of from to 
the decrease from the third to the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower operating income in the ic d segment and lower equity income from equistar 
the decrease in ic d operating income was primarily due to a sharp decline in mtbe margins due to lower sales prices and higher costs for butane  a key raw material 
in addition  the ic d segment was impacted by the effect of high natural gas prices on utility costs and a major turnaround at a plant in channelview  texas 
these factors more than offset a sales volume increase  primarily due to higher seasonal aircraft deicer sales 
equity income from equistar decreased to a loss in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in natural gas costs and  to a lesser extent  the slowing economy 
these conditions resulted in higher ngl raw material costs  higher natural gas based utility costs and lower product sales prices 
intermediate chemicals and derivatives ic d segment overview lyondell s operating results for include five months of operating results of the ic d business segment 
this segment consists of the business acquired from arco chemical  which is included in lyondell s operating results prospectively from august  beginning in early  the cost of raw materials began escalating  following the general trend in the commodity petrochemical industry 
benchmark prices of propylene  one of the major raw materials for this segment  more than doubled from the end of to the end of at the same time  approximately billion pounds of new po capacity  or over of existing world capacity  was added in late and early in europe 
this new capacity limited the ability to raise sales prices as the cost of propylene increased  putting pressure on margins during and in addition  lyondell sold the polyols business and ownership interests in its us po manufacturing operations to bayer on march  the following is a discussion of historical operating results for the years ended december  and and of the pro forma operating results for the year ended december  included in the unaudited pro forma combined historical results of lyondell and arco chemical see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited pro forma combined historical results give effect to the acquisition of arco chemical as if it had occurred at the beginning of the following table sets forth volumes  including processing volumes  included in sales and other operating revenues for this segment 
co product tertiary butyl alcohol tba is principally used to produce the derivative mtbe 
volumes for the polyols business  sold on march   are included through the date of sale 
bayer s ownership interest in the po joint venture represents ownership of an in kind portion of the po production of the po joint venture 
bayer s share of the po production from the po joint venture will increase from approximately billion pounds for the last nine months of to approximately billion pounds annually in and thereafter 
lyondell takes in kind the remaining po production and all co product sm and tba production from the po joint venture 
bayer s po volumes are not included in sales and are excluded from the table 
for the year ended december  volumes  in millions a po  po derivatives  tdi pounds    co products sm pounds    tba and derivatives gallons   millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues    unusual charges operating income a volumes and financial data are pro forma for the year ended december  revenues revenues in increased million  or  compared to  despite the march  sale of the polyols business 
the sale of the polyols business resulted in a decrease of million in sales revenues and a decrease of billion pounds in sales volumes  comparing to excluding the effect of polyols  sales revenues increased  primarily due to higher prices and volumes for mtbe and sm 
the higher mtbe prices and increase in mtbe sales volumes reflected higher gasoline prices  increased global demand  and tighter supplies 
new regulations in europe contributed to higher global demand  while new us reformulated gasoline standards affected supplies 
the higher sm prices and an increase in volumes reflected stronger demand in the first half of for  sales price increases for po and derivatives  excluding polyols  were tempered by new industry po capacity and the foreign exchange effects of a stronger us dollar 
po and derivatives volumes  excluding polyols  were essentially flat compared to due to the effect of new industry capacity in europe  which was primarily offset by higher us volumes 
actual revenues increased compared to pro forma revenues as a result of higher volumes  which were partly offset by lower average sales prices 
po  po derivatives and tdi volumes increased compared to driven by us economic growth  particularly in the automotive  housing and construction sectors  and continued improvements in asian economies 
asia accounted for about of lyondell s total po sales volumes 
sm volumes increased primarily due to higher exports to europe and asia as well as higher contractual amounts under long term sm processing arrangements 
tba and derivatives volumes increased due to higher global demand for mtbe 
average sales prices decreased in for po  po derivatives and tdi  despite higher average raw material costs 
the decrease reflects heightened competition in the po industry as a result of significant new european po capacity  which came on stream in late and early european sales prices were also negatively affected by the foreign exchange effect of a stronger us dollar 
unusual charges the period included pro forma net unusual charges of million  consisting of million related to the write off of in process research and development projects in connection with the arco chemical acquisition  million of lyondell severance costs  and a million reversal by arco chemical of its restructuring accrual 
operating income operating income of million in decreased from million in the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the polyols business and lower margins for po and derivatives  partly offset by higher margins and volumes for mtbe and sm 
po and derivatives product margins  excluding polyols  decreased as raw material costs  primarily propylene  rose in  while the new industry po capacity constrained price increases 
average benchmark propylene costs increased about compared to the improvement in mtbe margins reflected significantly higher prices primarily due to a stronger gasoline market 
decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as in research and development expense in primarily reflected the effects of the sale of the polyols business and benefits from cost reduction efforts 
excluding unusual charges  actual operating income of million decreased million or compared to pro forma operating income of million in operating income in reflected lower product margins due to lower sales prices and higher raw material costs 
the decrease in product margins was partly offset by a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  reflecting benefits of cost reduction efforts and a million reduction of estimated liabilities related to the arco chemical acquisition 
fourth quarter versus third quarter operating income in the fourth quarter decreased to million from million in the third quarter the decrease was due to a sharp drop in mtbe margins along with the effects of higher utility costs and a major planned turnaround at a po sm plant in channelview  texas 
spot market raw material margins for mtbe on the us gulf coast fell from about cents per gallon in the third quarter to about cents per gallon in the fourth quarter 
mtbe prices decreased about cents per gallon  primarily due to seasonal factors  while the cost of butane  the key raw material in mtbe  increased cents per gallon 
these factors more than offset an increase in po and derivatives sales volumes 
sales volumes for po  po derivatives and tdi increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 
this was primarily due to very strong aircraft deicer sales during the month of december along with continued volume growth in the solvents and butanediol product lines 
overall sales prices in the po business were flat compared to the third quarter  while propylene prices decreased about cents per pound 
the average price for contract chemical grade propylene in the fourth quarter was cents per pound compared to cents per pound in the third quarter 
equistar chemicals  lp overview general the three year period from to was marked by considerable volatility in the industry 
the fourth quarter marked a trough in the commodity petrochemical cycle due to a combination of new capacity  high inventory levels and the asian financial crisis 
in  ethylene and derivatives prices rebounded from year end lows as domestic ethylene demand grew by more than  while the industry experienced both planned and unplanned outages 
as a result  benchmark ethylene prices increased every quarter from the end of  peaking in mid raw material costs also began increasing during due to higher oil and gas prices 
these increases continued through into and remained at high levels during from the end of to the end of  the weighted average cost of raw materials for the industry rose 
surging natural gas costs late in increased both the costs of ngl based raw materials primarily ethane as well as the cost of utilities 
as a result  some us based producers  including equistar  idled plants that use ngl based raw materials 
also during  significant new industry ethylene capacity was added 
during the latter half of  demand began to weaken due to slower us economic growth 
as a result of these factors  benchmark ethylene prices declined in the fourth quarter net income equistar s net income of million increased million from net income  excluding unusual items  of million in the increase reflected the benefits of higher petrochemicals segment margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses partly offset by lower polymers segment margins and lower sales volumes in both segments 
the unusual items in included restructuring and other unusual charges of million and gains on asset sales of million 
petrochemicals margins improved in as average sales prices increased more than raw material costs 
however  polymers sales price increases in lagged behind raw material cost increases  leading to reduced margins 
lower volumes in both segments primarily reflected a slow down in demand in the latter half of equistar s net income  excluding unusual items  of million in decreased million from net income  excluding unusual items  of million in the decrease was attributable to lower polymers margins  higher general and administrative expenses  and higher interest expense in compared with these were only partly offset by higher petrochemicals sales volumes 
unusual items in included million of restructuring charges 
fourth quarter compared to third quarter equistar s net loss of million in the fourth quarter decreased from net income of million in the third quarter compared to the third quarter  equistar was affected by higher raw material and utility costs from an unprecedented increase in natural gas prices and lower selling prices for petrochemicals and polymers 
in the petrochemicals segment  operating income decreased from million in the third quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
ethylene cash margins in the fourth quarter were about half of third quarter levels due to a sharp rise in manufacturing costs and a decline in ethylene and propylene prices 
manufacturing costs were affected by higher ngl based raw material costs and higher utility costs 
costs of ngl based raw materials  primarily ethane  and utility costs were affected by the rapid increase in natural gas costs late in the fourth quarter reported ethylene cash margins for the us industry decreased from cents per pound in the third quarter to cents per pound in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the dramatic deterioration in profitability and reduced demand  there was a sharp reduction in industry operating rates  estimated by industry analysts at to of north american capacity 
in the polymers segment  the operating loss increased from million in the third quarter to million in the fourth quarter  reflecting a decline in margins and a drop in sales volumes from the third quarter 
polymers prices eroded more than the above noted decline in the price of ethylene  one of the principal raw materials for polymers 
average fourth quarter benchmark prices for polyethylene products were down approximately to from third quarter levels 
segment data the following tables reflect selected sales volume data  including intersegment sales volumes  and summarized financial information for equistar s business segments 
the addition of the occidental contributed business is reflected prospectively from may  for the year ended december  in millions selected petrochemicals products olefins pounds    aromatics gallons polymers products pounds    millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues petrochemicals segment    polymers segment    intersegment eliminations    total    cost of sales petrochemicals segment    polymers segment    intersegment eliminations    total    other operating expenses petrochemicals segment polymers segment unallocated restructuring and other unusual charges total operating income petrochemicals segment polymers segment unallocated total petrochemicals segment revenues revenues of billion in increased from billion in the increase was primarily due to higher average sales prices  as sales volumes were relatively flat compared to sales prices rose rapidly in  and remained at higher levels throughout  resulting in higher average prices in for example  average benchmark ethylene prices were higher in than in volumes were flat due to a slow down in demand in the latter half of  reflecting slower growth in the us economy 
as a result of the slower demand and the adverse effects of the rapid fourth quarter increase in natural gas costs  equistar idled some capacity in that uses ngl based raw materials 
revenues of billion in increased from billion in the increase was due to both higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes during as a result of rapidly rising prices throughout  which reflected stronger demand as well as increases in the underlying cost of raw materials  average sales prices for were about higher than average sales prices for sales volumes increased about during  reflecting a full year of the occidental contributed business and stronger demand 
operating income operating income of million in increased compared to million in gross margin as a percent of sales was flat at  as sales price increases  on average  kept pace with raw material cost increases 
generally  equistar was able to increase sales prices more than the increase in raw material costs per unit 
operating income of million in increased compared to million in  while gross margin as a percent of sales was flat at 
gross margin percentages were flat as sales prices increases  on average  kept pace with increases in raw material costs 
the benefit from increased sales volumes was only partly offset by the effects of the production unit outage in the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to inclusion of a full year of operations of the occidental contributed business  which was added in mid may polymers segment revenues revenues of billion in increased compared to revenues of billion in due to higher sales prices partly offset by lower sales volumes 
average sales prices were higher  primarily in response to higher raw material costs for ethylene and propylene 
sales volumes declined due to a combination of a planned maintenance turnaround at the morris  illinois plant in the second quarter and a slow down in demand in the latter half of  reflecting slower growth in the us economy 
revenues of billion in decreased slightly from revenues primarily due to lower sales volumes 
sales volumes decreased due to the shut down of less efficient hdpe and other polymer product capacity  plant maintenance and the sale of the concentrates and compounds business in industry sales prices  which began decreasing during the fourth quarter  continued in a downward trend throughout  but then increased during as raw material costs increased 
as a result  average sales prices were comparable from to operating income the operating loss of million in decreased from operating income of million in the decrease was primarily due to substantially lower margins for compared to as raw material cost increases outpaced sales price increases 
gross margin as a percent of sales was negative in compared to in operating income of million in decreased compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to substantially lower margins for compared to as raw material cost increases outpaced sales price increases 
gross margin as a percent of sales decreased to in from in unallocated items the following discusses expenses that were not allocated to the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
other operating expenses this caption includes general and administrative expenses and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
unallocated expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase from to was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefit expenses and costs associated with year preventive measures 
the decrease from to reflects the reduction in compensation and employee benefit expenses and year costs  as well as savings realized from the consolidation of certain administrative functions under the shared services agreement with lyondell 
restructuring and other unusual charges restructuring and other unusual charges were million in and million in during  equistar recorded a charge of million associated with a decision to shut down certain polymer reactors and severance costs related to these shutdowns and consolidation of certain administrative functions between lyondell and equistar 
the decision to shut down the polymer reactors was based on their high production costs  market conditions in the polyethylene industry and the flexibility to utilize more efficient reactors to meet customer requirements 
approximately million of the total charge was an adjustment of the asset carrying values of the reactors 
the remaining million represented severance and other employee related costs for approximately employee positions that were eliminated 
the eliminated positions  primarily administrative functions  resulted from opportunities to consolidate such services among lyondell and equistar and  to a lesser extent  positions associated with the shut down polymer reactors 
equistar made severance payments of million in as of december   substantially all of the employee terminations had been completed and the remaining liability was eliminated 
equistar incurred and recorded million of restructuring charges related to the addition of the occidental contributed business in interest expense  net and other income net interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense increased from to due to higher levels of debt as a result of the addition of the occidental contributed business in mid may interest expense also increased from to and from to due to the february refinancing of million of bank debt with senior unsecured notes  which carry a higher fixed rate of interest 
other income of million in primarily consisted of net gains on asset sales  including the sale of the concentrates and compounds business in april lyondell citgo refining lp refining segment overview pdvsa oil reduced deliveries to lcr under the crude supply agreement from the  barrels per day contract rate to  barrels per day  beginning in august in may  the deliveries were further reduced to  barrels per day 
deliveries were increased to  barrels per day in april  to  barrels per day in july and restored to the  barrels per day contract level in october a stronger gasoline market in helped improve the margins that lcr realized on its spot purchases of crude oil 
lcr experienced major unplanned outages of a coker unit and a fluid catalytic cracker unit during the second quarter  and had a major planned turnaround in the second quarter the following table sets forth  in thousands of barrels per day  sales volumes for lcr s refined products and processing rates at the refinery for the periods indicated for the year ended december  refined products sales volumes gasoline diesel and heating oil jet fuel aromatics other refined products total refined products volumes crude processing rates crude supply agreement coked other heavy crude oil coked other crude oil total crude processing rates revenues revenues for lcr  including intersegment sales  were billion in  billion in and billion in the increase in compared to is primarily due to higher sales prices 
sales volumes increased 
prices of refined products increased in  pushed by higher average benchmark crude oil prices that were higher than for crude oil prices increased sharply in  and remained at higher levels throughout  resulting in a higher average price in than in sales volumes and crude supply agreement processing rates were higher in compared to as pdvsa oil increased deliveries of crude supply agreement crude oil during after having reduced deliveries in and again in the revenue increase in compared to was due to higher prices partly offset by lower volumes 
prices of refined products increased in as crude oil prices escalated rapidly 
the lower sales volumes and processing rates in primarily reflect the lower deliveries of crude oil under the crude supply agreement and  to a lesser extent  the effect of the second quarter unplanned production unit outages 
net income lcr s net income was million in  million in and million in the improvement in compared to was due to increased deliveries and an improved mix of crude supply agreement crude oil  higher spot margins  reflecting a stronger gasoline market in  and higher margins for reformulated gasoline due to industry supply shortages 
these improvements were partly offset by higher fuels and utility costs and interest expense 
while the second quarter was negatively impacted by a major planned turnaround  this was more than offset by the effect of unplanned production unit outages in the second quarter the decrease in from primarily reflected reduced processing of extra heavy crude oil as a result of lower deliveries and a less favorable mix of crude oil received from pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement  partially offset by increased processing of spot crude 
margins on the crude oil purchased in the spot market were also lower compared to the operating results were also negatively affected by costs and lower operating rates related to the unplanned outages during the second quarter the and periods included pretax charges of million and million  respectively  associated with lcr s renegotiated labor agreement 
interest expense lcr s net interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense increased in due to fees and higher interest rates associated with the refinancing of lcr s debt in may and september fourth quarter versus third quarter lcr had net income of million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter lcr benefited from continued excellent operating reliability and delivery of contract levels of crude oil under the crude supply agreement in the fourth quarter 
compared to the third quarter  the benefit of higher margins on spot crude was more than offset by higher utility costs 
the third quarter also benefited from the processing of inventoried crude oil volumes  which did not recur in the fourth quarter 
processing of crude supply agreement crude oil averaged  barrels per day during the fourth quarter 
the crude supply agreement processing rate was lower than the crude supply agreement delivery rate due to the timing of crude oil receipts  which resulted in the processing of a higher ratio of spot market crude oil during the quarter 
total crude processing rates in the fourth quarter averaged  barrels per day 
financial condition operating activities cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in the period reflects the effects of the asset sale to bayer and higher working capital 
efforts to reduce working capital have been hampered by the escalation in sales prices and raw material costs 
although working capital metrics such as days of working capital  receivables collection efficiency and inventory turnover have all improved  these benefits have been offset by the effects of higher sales prices and raw material costs  requiring additional investment in working capital that reduces funds available for debt reduction 
cash provided by operating activities in included customer advances and tax refunds totaling approximately million 
investing activities on march   lyondell completed the sale of the polyols business and ownership interests in its us po manufacturing operations to bayer for approximately billion 
as part of the transaction  lyondell and bayer entered into the po joint venture and the separate po technology joint venture 
in addition  on december   lyondell and bayer formed a separate joint venture for the construction of po  the previously announced world scale po sm plant located in the netherlands 
lyondell sold a interest in the po project  based on project expenditures to date  to bayer for approximately million 
lyondell and bayer each contributed their interest in po into the joint venture and each will bear of the costs going forward to complete the project 
the plant is expected to start up in the second quarter of lyondell and bayer do not share marketing or product sales under either the po joint venture or po during the third quarter  construction began on a new million pound per year bdo facility in europe known as bdo the construction is being financed by a third party lessor  who will retain ownership of the facility and  upon completion in the second quarter of  lease it to a subsidiary of lyondell by means of an operating lease 
in the transaction documents for bdo  lyondell agreed to comply with certain financial and other covenants that are substantially the same as those contained in the credit facility 
a breach of those covenants could result in  among other things  lyondell having to pay the project costs incurred to date 
as of december   lyondell was in compliance with all of those covenants 
however  given the poor current business environment  lyondell is seeking amendments to the transaction documents consistent with the amendments being sought to its credit facility 
lyondell anticipates that the amendments will become effective prior to march  see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the proposed amendments to the credit facility 
lyondell made capital expenditures of million in  including initial spending on the po facility and expansion of a tdi plant in france 
lyondell s pro rata share of equistar s and lcr s capital expenditures was million and million  respectively 
lyondell s capital budget is million  and its pro rata share of equistar s and lcr s projected capital spending is million and million  respectively 
the higher capital amounts reflect increased spending for po by lyondell  cost reduction and business opportunity projects at equistar  and higher spending for regulatory compliance  maintenance and cost reduction projects at lcr 
distributions from affiliates in excess of earnings for were million  principally from lcr 
contributions and advances to affiliates of million in included contributions and loans of million and million  respectively  to lcr for capital projects 
financing activities lyondell used the net proceeds of the sale to bayer to significantly reduce its variable rate debt 
during  lyondell used the net proceeds to repay the billion outstanding balance of term loan a  the million outstanding balance of term loan f and million of the outstanding balance of term loan b 
additionally  lyondell repaid the million outstanding balance of the debentures  which matured in november  and reduced the outstanding balance of term loan b by an additional million 
lyondell also made million of other scheduled debt repayments and paid million in debt amendment fees and million of term loan b call premiums 
lyondell paid regular quarterly dividends of 
per share of common stock in for a total of million 
liquidity and capital resources at december   lyondell had cash on hand of million 
lyondell also had million available under its revolving credit facility that extends until july current maturities of long term debt are million 
aggregate maturities of long term debt are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and billion thereafter 
lyondell s credit facility and the indentures under which lyondell s senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes were issued contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict sale and leaseback transactions  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  dividends and investments  sales of assets and mergers and consolidations 
in addition  the credit facility requires lyondell to maintain specified financial ratios and consolidated net worth  in all cases as provided in the credit facility 
the breach of these covenants could permit the lenders under lyondell s credit facility and indentures to declare the loans immediately payable and could permit the lenders under lyondell s credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
for more detailed information  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and the full text of the credit facility and the indentures  which have been filed as exhibits to this form k 
lyondell secured an amendment to certain financial covenants in the credit facility in february designed to increase its financial and operating flexibility in the near term 
lyondell was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility and the indentures as of december  however  given the poor current business environment  lyondell is seeking an amendment to the credit facility that would further increase its financial and operating flexibility  primarily by making certain financial ratio requirements less restrictive 
lyondell anticipates that the amendment will become effective prior to march  in addition to amending certain financial convenants in the credit facility  the february amendment to the credit facility eliminated a cross default provision in the credit facility that could have been triggered by a default by lcr under its debt instruments 
on may   lyondell and citgo  as partners of lcr  arranged interim financing for lcr to repay the million outstanding under the lcr construction facility 
on september   lyondell and citgo completed the syndication of one year credit facilities for lcr  including a million term loan to replace the interim financing and a million revolving credit facility to be used for working capital and other general business purposes 
lyondell and citgo  as partners of lcr  have agreed to pursue a refinancing of the indebtedness  although the final terms have not been determined 
based on previous experience of refinancing lcr s debt and the current conditions of the financial markets  the management of lcr  lyondell and citgo anticipate that this debt can be refinanced prior to its maturity 
equistar had outstanding debt of billion at december  lyondell remains liable on million of equistar debt for which equistar assumed primary responsibility in connection with its formation 
at december   equistar and lcr had combined outstanding debt of billion to unrelated parties and combined equity of approximately billion 
the ability of the joint ventures to distribute cash to lyondell is reduced by their respective debt service obligations 
equistar s credit facility contains covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict sale and leaseback transactions  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  sales of assets and mergers and consolidations  and require equistar to maintain certain specified financial ratios  in all cases as provided in the credit facility 
the breach of these covenants could permit the lenders to declare the loans immediately payable and to terminate future lending commitments 
furthermore  a default under equistar s debt instruments involving more than million of indebtedness would constitute a cross default under lyondell s credit facility 
for more detailed information  please see the full text of the equistar and lyondell credit facilities  which have been filed as exhibits to this form k 
equistar was in compliance with all covenants under its debt instruments as of december  however  given the poor current business environment  equistar is seeking an amendment to its credit facility that would increase its financial and operating flexibility  primarily by making certain financial ratio requirements less restrictive 
equistar anticipates that the amendment will become effective prior to march  lyondell believes that conditions will be such that cash balances  cash generated from operating activities and funds from lines of credit will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements for scheduled debt repayments  necessary capital expenditures and dividends 
current business outlook given high energy and raw material costs and a weakening domestic economy  lyondell expects first quarter consolidated operating results to be roughly comparable to the fourth quarter in the ic d segment  mtbe margins have improved from fourth quarter levels 
po and derivatives margins could benefit if propylene costs continue declining  however volumes will be adversely affected by weaker demand due to the economy 
despite the shutdown of equistar s port arthur facility  which will result in a first quarter charge for severance and shutdown activity  equistar expects first quarter operating results to improve over the fourth quarter raw material costs are trending downwards  and equistar is implementing price increases in both the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
success in implementing the price increases will depend on industry demand levels and the strength of the economy 
lcr profits and production will be down in the first quarter due to unplanned downtime and high natural gas costs 
although pdvsa oil informed lcr that the venezuelan government has instructed that production of certain grades of crude oil be reduced effective february   lcr has not been advised of any reductions in deliveries to lcr and would continue to dispute any such reduction 
lcr cannot predict the level of reductions  if any  that may be forthcoming 
industry forecasts project that operating results will be negatively affected by high raw material costs  a slowing economy and industry wide ethylene capacity additions 
these forecasts predict that higher raw material costs and uncertain economic growth will continue to pressure profit margins in the first half of in addition  industry ethylene capacity currently under construction is scheduled to start up late in the second quarter and is forecast to put pressure on ethylene pricing and margins in the latter half of lyondell management feels that the market has already factored in the impact of the new industry capacity  and that the key to any improvement will be economic growth to generate additional demand and lower energy and raw material costs

european monetary union on january   the euro became the official currency for the member countries of the european union participating in monetary union 
euro banknotes and coins will be introduced on january  and the former national currency banknotes and coins will be withdrawn by july  at the latest 
lyondell converted its systems to invoice customers in euros beginning january  due to year priorities and the planned conversion of lyondell s european business and financial systems to enterprise software from sap america  inc in july  it is anticipated that the full conversion of systems to the euro will not be completed until july based upon the assessments completed to date  european monetary union has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on lyondell s consolidated financial statements 
lyondell s european based revenues are approximately billion on an annual basis 
environmental matters various environmental laws and regulations impose substantial requirements upon the operations of lyondell 
lyondell s policy is to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  which include  among others  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla as amended  rcra and the clean air act amendments 
lyondell does not specifically track all recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
such costs are included in cost of sales 
lyondell  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures also make capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations 
such capital expenditures totaled  in the aggregate  approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
all such expenditures were funded by cash generated from operations 
lyondell is also subject to certain assessment and remedial actions at its own plant sites under rcra and at cercla sites 
the liability under rcra and various state and foreign government regulations primarily relates to the lcr refinery  five current lyondell plant sites and three former plant sites 
under cercla  the liability primarily relates to three federal sites 
lyondell is also involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to a minimal number of other cercla sites 
lyondell estimates  based upon currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with the latter cercla sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant 
in addition  lyondell has negotiated an order with the tnrcc for assessment and remediation of groundwater and soil contamination at the lcr refinery 
as of december   lyondell s environmental liability for future assessment and remediation costs at the above mentioned sites totaled million 
the liabilities per site range from less than million to million and are expected to be incurred over the next two to seven years 
lyondell spent million to million annually for each of the last three years for environmental remediation matters 
lyondell estimates that expenditures will also be approximately million in in the opinion of management  there is currently no material range of loss in excess of the amount recorded for these sites 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in other cercla  rcra  tnrcc or other comparable state or foreign law investigations  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters 
the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the epa 
the texas natural resource conservation commission has submitted a plan to the epa to reach and demonstrate compliance with the ozone standard by the year compliance with the provisions of the plan will result in increased capital investment and higher operating costs for equistar  lyondell  and lcr during the next several years 
as a result of these rules  lyondell estimates that capital expenditures will increase to approximately million in and will increase further in the timing and amount of these expenditures are subject to regulatory and other uncertainties  including litigation  as well as obtaining the necessary permits and approvals 
for periods beyond  additional environmentally related capital expenditures will be required  which could total between million and million for lyondell  equistar and lcr before the deadline 
lyondell s share of such expenditures would total between million and million 
in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  while studies by federal and state agencies and other organizations have shown that mtbe is safe for use in gasoline  is not carcinogenic and is effective in reducing automotive emissions  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern that mtbe may  in certain limited circumstances  affect the taste and odor of drinking water supplies  and thereby lead to possible environmental issues 
certain federal and state governmental initiatives have sought either to rescind the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or ban the use of mtbe 
at the federal level  a blue ribbon panel appointed by the epa issued its report on july  that report recommended  among other things  reducing the use of mtbe in gasoline 
during  the epa announced its intent to seek legislative changes from congress to give the epa authority to ban mtbe over a three year period 
such action would only be granted through amendments to the clean air act 
additionally  the epa is seeking a ban of mtbe utilizing rulemaking authority contained in the toxic substance control act 
it would take at least three years for such a rule to issue 
recently  however  senior policy analysts at the us department of energy presented a study stating that banning mtbe would create significant economic risk 
the presentation did not identify any benefits from banning mtbe 
the epa initiatives mentioned above or other governmental actions could result in a significant reduction in lyondell s mtbe sales 
the company has developed technologies to convert tba into alternate gasoline blending components should it be necessary to reduce mtbe production in the future 
see items and business and properties intermediate chemicals and derivatives overview 
additionally  the clean air act specified certain emissions standards for vehicles beginning in the model year and required the epa to study whether further emissions reduction standards for vehicles were necessary 
new standards for gasoline were finalized in and will require refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by  with some allowances for a conditional phase in period that could extend final compliance until a new on road diesel standard was adopted in late and will require refiners to produce low sulfur diesel fuel by these rules could result in increased capital investment and higher operating costs for lcr 
equistar s olefins fuel business may also be impacted if these rules increase the cost for processing fuel components

subsequently  the fasb delayed the effective date by one year 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  amending certain provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending upon whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current period earnings 
the statement is effective for the calendar year sfas no 
implementation did not have a significant effect on the financial statements of lyondell  equistar or lcr 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in the financial statements 
the statement was effective for lyondell s fourth quarter of lyondell  equistar and lcr were in compliance with the provisions of sab no 
therefore  implementation of sab no 
did not have an impact on their financial statements 
forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in this report  including those set forth in items and business and properties  this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those set forth in item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although lyondell believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  they do involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  and lyondell can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
lyondell s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  uncertainties associated with the united states and worldwide economies  current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the united states and in other countries  substantial chemical and refinery capacity additions resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins  the availability and cost of raw materials  lyondell s ability to implement cost reductions  and operating interruptions including leaks  explosions  fires  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  spills and releases and other environmental risks 
many of such factors are beyond lyondell s or its joint ventures ability to control or predict 
management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward looking statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels 
all forward looking statements in this form k are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this report 
item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of lyondell s products and raw materials  as well as those of equistar  lcr and lmc  are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of lyondell s profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
lyondell tries to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
these include increasing the olefins plants raw material flexibility  entering into multi year processing and sales agreements  moving downstream into olefins derivatives products whose pricing is more stable  and the use of the deemed margin contract at lcr 
lyondell has not used derivative instruments for commodity price hedging purposes 
equistar has entered into over the counter derivatives for crude oil to help manage its exposure to commodity price risk with respect to crude oil related raw material purchases 
as of december   the outstanding over the counter derivatives covered million barrels  mature from january through july  and cover from approximately in january to approximately in july of equistar s crude oil related raw material requirements for those periods 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in crude oil prices from those in effect at year end  the loss in earnings for the combined derivatives contracts would be million 
lyondell s pretax share would be approximately million 
sensitivity analysis was used for this purpose 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 
equistar does not engage in any derivatives trading activities 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures result from cash flows between us and foreign operations and transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a foreign operating entity 
lyondell is using foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the exposure related to euro denominated capital commitments related to the construction of the po plant in the netherlands 
although lyondell uses these types of contracts to reduce foreign exchange exposures with respect to capital commitments denominated in euros  there can be no assurance that such hedging techniques will protect lyondell s capital commitments from adverse exchange rate fluctuations or that lyondell will not incur material losses on such contracts 
furthermore  these contracts are not designed to protect lyondell s reported results against exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   lyondell had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the notional amount of million euros approximately million 
assuming a hypothetical unfavorable change in the euro exchange rate from that in effect at year end  the foreign exchange loss on these contracts would be million 
sensitivity analysis was used for this purpose 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the effects of the underlying operating transactions 
lyondell does not engage in any derivatives trading activities 
interest rate risk lyondell is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt 
during  lyondell reduced variable rate debt from billion at december  to billion at december   thereby reducing its exposure to interest rate risk 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates from those in effect at year end  the increase in annual interest expense on the variable rate debt would be approximately million 
at december   equistar and lcr had variable rate debt of million and million  respectively  excluding the note payable by lcr to lyondell 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates from those in effect at year end  lyondell s share of the increase in annual interest expense on the variable rate debt would be approximately million 
sensitivity analysis was used for both of the above analyses 
regulatory risk certain federal and state governmental initiatives in the us have sought either to rescind the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or ban the use of mtbe 
lyondell does not expect the recent proposals to have a significant impact on mtbe margins and volumes in the near term 
in europe  mtbe demand is benefiting from new legislation in the european union  which may offset any potential decline in the us should it become necessary to reduce mtbe production over the longer term  lyondell would need to make capital expenditures to convert its mtbe plants to production of alternate gasoline blending components 
the profit margins on such alternate gasoline blending components could differ from those historically realized on mtbe 
see items and business and properties intermediate chemicals and derivatives overview 
new air pollution standards promulgated by federal and state regulatory agencies in the us  including those specifically targeting the eight county houston galveston region  will affect a substantial portion of the operating facilities of lyondell  equistar and lcr 
compliance with these standards will result in increased capital investment and higher operating costs for lyondell  equistar and lcr during the next several years
