under this method of accounting  encompass historical results for periods prior to the merger are the same as building one s historical results 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein for further discussion of the merger 
the company reflecting the operations of both building one and groupmac has historically derived revenues from providing services for electrical  mechanical and other systems to electrical mechanical industrial and residential customers and providing janitorial and maintenance management services 
the company recognizes maintenance  repair and replacement revenues  including janitorial and maintenance management services  as services are performed  except for service contract revenue  which is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
the company generally accounts for revenues from fixed price installation and retrofit contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
cost of services consists primarily of components  parts and supplies  salaries and benefits of service and installation technicians  subcontracted services  depreciation  fuel and other vehicle expenses and equipment rentals 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits for management  administrative salaries and benefits  advertising  office rent and utilities  communications and professional fees

the company has or will eliminate business units by closing  selling or merging them with other encompass locations 
excluding the results of the units to be eliminated  the gross profit of the company would have been million for the year ended december   million higher than reported results including these units  and million for the year ended december   million lower than reported results including these units 
gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this decline primarily resulted from the decreased profitability of the business units to be eliminated and from a local management focus on achieving targeted growth levels that drove significant revenue growth at the expense of margin preservation 
in addition  management believes that  during the first half of  issues related to the merger caused a significant amount of distraction among the operating leadership of the company 
in addition  the merger resulted in a higher proportion of revenues for the year ended december  from mechanical and industrial companies  which traditionally have lower gross margins than electrical companies

seasonality and cyclicality a significant portion of the company s business involves installation of mechanical and electrical systems in newly constructed commercial  industrial and residential facilities 
the portion of the company s business related to new construction is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
specifically  the demand for the company s contracting services involving new construction is generally lower during the winter months  when construction activities are reduced as a result of inclement weather in many areas of the united states 
in addition  the demand for mechanical maintenance  repair and replacement services tends to also be lower in the winter months due to lower air conditioning usage during these months 
accordingly  the company expects its revenues and operating results generally will be lowest in the first fiscal quarter of the year 
historically  the construction industry has also been highly cyclical 
the level of new construction in the commercial and industrial sectors is affected by  among other things  local and national economic conditions  interest rates  inflationary concerns  capital market activities and governmental activities at the regional and national levels 
factors impacting the level of new residential construction tend to be regional in nature  and include general employment and personal income levels  the availability and cost of financing for new home buyers and the general economic outlook for a given geographic region 
the company performs contracting services related to new construction in a variety of industries including  among others  data and telecommunications  automotive  heavy industrial  residential housing  retail  health care  education  petrochemical refining  and sports and entertainment 
consequently  management believes that a temporary slowdown in new construction related to any one of these industries would not likely have a material impact on the company s financial condition 
however  concurrent downturns in new construction in multiple industries or geographic regions  or prolonged slowdowns in specific industries or geographic regions  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  including its financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
inflation inflation did not have a significant effect on the results of operations for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations and growth from proceeds from building one s initial public offering in late  internally generated working capital and borrowings from commercial banks or other lenders

at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants required under the new credit facility 
to date  neither the terms of the new credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which the senior subordinated notes were issued nor the debt represented thereby have materially restricted the company s ability to finance operations or capital needs or to respond to changes in the company s business or competitive activity
