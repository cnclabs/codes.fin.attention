item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s businesses fall into six general categories consumer mort gage originations  mortgage related investments  bc insurance  processing and technology  capital markets and bb insuran ce 
see business mortgage originations segment  business mortgage related investments segment  business bc insurance s egment  business processing and technology segment  business capital markets segment and business bb insurance segment 
t he company intends to continue its efforts to expand its operations in each of these areas 
a strong production capability and a growin g servicing portfolio are the primary means used by the company to reduce the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rat es because the effect of interest rate changes on loan production income is countercyclical to their effect on servicing income

marketing expenses for fiscal increased to million  up from million for fiscal the increase was primarily related to the growth in the company s origination volume of non trad itional loan products 
insurance net losses are attributable to insurance claims in the bb insura nce segment 
insurance losses were million for fiscal and are due to the acquisition of balboa on no vember  these losses will increase or decrease during a period depending primarily on the volume of claims caused by natural d isasters 
other operating expenses were million for fiscal as compare d to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of balboa  partially offset by a reductio n in reserves for bad debt due primarily to improved property values nationally 
in fiscal  the company initiated a corporate reorganization re lated to its servicing operations 
as a result of the reorganization  future state income tax liabilities are expected to be le ss than the amounts that were previously recorded as deferred income tax expense and liability in the company s financial state ments 
the expected reduction in tax liabilities was reflected as a reduction in deferred state income tax expense in fiscal quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk 
from an e nterprise perspective  the company manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination consumer and institutional operatio ns and mortgage related investments  which are counter cyclical in nature 
in addition  the company utilizes various financial instru ments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed pipeline  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs  mbs retained in securitizations  trading securities and debt securities 
the overall o bjective of the company s interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from cha nges in interest rates 
the company does not speculate on the direction of interest rates in its management of interest rate risk 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the company perfor ms various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on its interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate scenarios including selected hypothetical instantaneous paralle l shifts in the yield curve 
various modeling techniques are employed to value the financial instruments 
for mortgages loans  mbs and mbs forward contracts and cmos  an option adjusted spread oas model is used 
the primary assumptions used in this model ar e the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing m odel is used 
the primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
msrs and residual interests ar e valued using discounted cash flow models 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credi t losses 
utilizing the sensitivity analyses described above  as of february   the company estimates that a permanent reduction in interest rates  all else being constant  would result in no aft er tax loss related to its trading securities or to its other financial instruments and msrs combined 
these sensitivity analyse s are limited by the fact that they are performed at a particular point in time  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptio ns used  including prepayment forecasts  and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financi al performance in such a scenario 
consequently  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as a forecast 
an additional  albeit less significant  market risk facing the company i s foreign currency risk 
the company has issued foreign currency denominated medium term notes see note f 
the company manages the foreign currency risk associated with such medium term notes by entering into currency swaps 
the terms of the currency swaps ef fectively translate the foreign currency denominated medium term notes into us dollars  thereby eliminating the associated f oreign currency risk subject to the performance of the various counterparties to the currency swaps 
as a result  potential c hanges in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on fu ture earnings  fair values or cash flows 
inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the consumer mortgage originations  mortgage related investments and capital markets segments 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  loan production decreases  particul arly from loan refinancings 
although in an environment of gradual interest rate increases  purchase activity may actually be stim ulated by an improving economy or the anticipation of increasing real estate values 
in such periods of reduced loan productio n  production margins may decline due to increased competition resulting primarily from over capacity in the market 
in a higher interest rate environment  mortgage related investment earnings are enhanced because prepayment rates tend to slow down thereby e xtending the average life of the company s servicing portfolio and reducing amortization and impairment of the msrs  and because t he rate of interest earned from the custodial balances tends to increase 
conversely  as interest rates decline  loan production  pa rticularly from loan refinancings  increases 
however  during such periods  prepayment rates tend to accelerate principally on the portion of the portfolio having a note rate higher than the prevailing mortgage rates  thereby decreasing the average life of the co mpany s servicing portfolio and adversely impacting its mortgage related investment earnings primarily due to increased amortization and impairment of the msrs  and decreased earnings from residual investments 
the servicing hedge is designed to mitigate the i mpact of changing interest rates on mortgage related investment earnings 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
th ese trends reflect the general national pattern of sales and resales of homes  although refinancings tend to be less seasonal and mor e closely related to changes in mortgage rates 
sales and resales of homes typically peak during the spring and summer seasons an d decline to lower levels from mid november through february 
in addition  delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the win ter months 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal financing needs related to its mortgage banki ng operations are the financing of its mortgage loan inventory  investment in msrs and available for sale securities 
to meet th ese needs  the company currently utilizes commercial paper supported by revolving credit facilities  medium term notes  mbs repurch ase agreements  subordinated notes  pre sale funding facilities  redeemable capital trust pass through securities  convertible debe ntures  securitization of servicing fee income and cash flow from operations 
in addition  in the past the company has utilized whol e loan repurchase agreements  servicing secured bank facilities  private placements of unsecured notes and other financings  direc t borrowings from revolving credit facilities and public offerings of common and preferred stock 
the company strives to maintain suffi cient liquidity in the form of unused  committed lines of credit to meet anticipated short term cash requirements as well as to prov ide for potential sudden increases in business activity driven by changes in the market environment 
certain of the debt obligations of cci and chl contain various provisi ons that may affect the ability of cci and chl to pay dividends and remain in compliance with such obligations 
these provisions include requirements concerning net worth and other financial covenants 
these provisions have not had  and are not expected to have  an adverse impact on the ability of cci and chl to pay dividends 
the principal financing needs of ccm consist of the financing of its inventory of securities and mortgage loans and its underwriting activities 
its securities inventory is financed primarily th rough repurchase agreements 
ccm also has access to a million secured bank loan facility and a secured lending facility with chl the primary cash needs for the bb insurance segment are to meet short te rm and long term obligations to policyholders ie  payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally com missions and the purchases of new investments 
to meet these needs  balboa currently utilizes cash flow provided from operations as well as through partial liquidation of its investment portfolio from time to time 
the company continues to investigate and pursue alternative and supplementa ry methods to finance its operations through the public and private capital markets 
these may include such methods as mortgage lo an sale transactions designed to expand the company s financial capacity and reduce its cost of capital and the additional securitiza tion of servicing income cash flows 
in connection with its derivative contracts  the company may be requir ed to deposit cash or certain government securities or obtain letters of credit to meet margin requirements 
the company consider s such potential margin requirements in its overall liquidity management 
in the course of the company s mortgage banking operations  the company sells the mortgage loans it originates and purchases to investors but generally retains the right to service the loans  thereby incr easing the company s investment in msrs 
the company views the sale of loans on a servicing retained basis in part as an investment vehicle 
significant unanticipated prepayments in the company s servicing portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the compa ny s future operating results and liquidity 
cash flows operating activities 
in fiscal  the company s operating activities used cash of approximately billion on a short term basis to support an increase in trading securities and other financial instrum ents  primarily securities purchased under agreements to resale 
in fiscal  operating activities provided cash of approximately billion 
investing activities 
the primary investing activity for which cash w as used by the company was the investment in msrs and available for sale securities 
net cash used by investing activities was billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities amoun ted to billion for fiscal and net cash used by financing activities amounted to billion for fiscal the increase in cash flow from financing activities was primarily used to fund the company s investment in msrs and available for sale securi ties and the increase in trading securities and other financial instruments 
prospective trends applications and pipeline of loans in process for the month ended april   the company received new loa n applications at an average daily rate of million 
as of april   the company s pipeline of loans in process wa s billion 
this compares to a daily application rate for the month ended april  of million and a pipeline of loan s in process as of april  of billion 
the size of the pipeline is generally an indication of the level of near term futur e fundings  as historically to of the pipeline of loans in process has funded 
in addition  at april   the comp any had committed to make loans in the amount of billion  subject to property identification and approval of the loans the l ock n shop r pipeline 
at april   the lock n shop r pipeline was billion 
future application levels and loan funding s are dependent on numerous factors  including the level of demand for mortgage loans  the level of competition in the market  the dir ection of mortgage rates  seasonal factors and general economic conditions 
market factors loan production increased from fiscal to fiscal this in crease was primarily due to an increase in loan purchase production of to billion during the same period driven by an increase in the company s market share 
the prepayment rate in the servicing portfolio decreased from for fisca l to for fiscal the company s california mortgage loan production as measured by pr incipal balance constituted and of its total production during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
some regions i n which the company operates have experienced slower economic growth  and real estate financing activity in these regions has been impacted negatively 
the company has striven to diversify its mortgage banking activities geographically to mitigate such effec ts 
the delinquency rate in the company s servicing portfolio  excluding sub se rvicing  increased to as of february  from as of february  this increase was prim arily the result of changes in portfolio mix and aging 
sub prime loans which tend to experience higher delinquency rates than pr ime loans represented approximately of the total portfolio as of february   up from as of february  in addition  the weighted average age of the fha and va l oans which also tend to experience higher delinquency sales than conventional loans in the portfolio increased to months at february  from months in february  delinquency rates ten d to increase as loans age  reaching a peak at three to five years of age 
related late charge income has historically been sufficien t to offset incremental servicing expenses resulting from increased loan delinquencies 
the percentage of loans in the company s servicing portfolio  excluding su b servicing  that are in foreclosure increased to as of february  from as of february  because the compan y services substantially all conventional loans on a non recourse basis  related credit losses are generally the responsibility of the investor or insurer and not the company 
while the company does not generally retain credit risk with respect to the prime credit quality first mortgage loans it sells  it does have potential liability under representations and warranties made to purchaser s and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties  the company may be required to repur chase a mortgage loan and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan will be borne by the company 
similarly  government loans s erviced by the company of the company s servicing portfolio as of february  are insured by the fha or partially guara nteed against loss by the va 
the company is exposed to credit losses to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the va is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
for fiscal  and  the losses on va loans in excess of the va gua rantee were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company retains credit risk on the ho me equity and sub prime loans it securitizes  through retention of a subordinated interest or through a corporate guarantee of los ses up to a negotiated maximum amount 
as of february   the company had investments in such subordinated interests amountin g to million and had reserves amounting to million related to such corporate guarantees 
servicing hedge as previously discussed  the company s servicing hedge is designed to prot ect the value of its investment in msrs from the effects of increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining inter est rates 
in periods of increasing interest rates  the value of the servicing hedge generally declines and the value of msrs gen erally increases 
the historical correlation of the servicing hedge and the msrs has been very high 
however  given the complexi ty and uncertainty inherent in hedging msrs  there can be no assurance that future results will match or approximate the historical pe rformance of the servicing hedge 
implementation of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued st atement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  amended by statement no 
 deferral of the effecti ve date of fasb statement no 
and statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment to fasb statement no 
collectively  fas 
fas requires companies to record derivatives on their balan ce sheets at fair value 
changes in the fair values of those derivatives would be reported in earnings or other comprehensive inco me depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is tha t the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of assets or liabilities or cash f lows from forecasted transactions 
this statement was effective for the company on march  at the date of initial application  the company recorded certain transition adjustments as required by fas there was no impact on net income as a result of suc h transition adjustments 
however  such adjustments resulted in the company reducing the carrying amount of derivative assets by million and recognizing million of derivative liabilities on its balance sheet 
management believes that the company s hedg ing activities are highly effective over the long term 
however  the implementation of fas could result in more volatility in quarterly reported earnings as a result of market conditions that temporarily impact the value of the derivatives while not reduc ing their long term hedge effect 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  account ing for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which replaces fas of the same title 
fas revises certain standards in the accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral  and requires some disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collate ral that were not required by fas  however  fas carries over most of fas s provisions 
the collateral and disclosure pro visions of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the february  financial statements for the co mpany include the disclosures required by fas the other provisions of fas are effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  management does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company
