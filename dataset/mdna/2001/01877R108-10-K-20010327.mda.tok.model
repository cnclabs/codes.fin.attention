item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the partnership and its predecessor should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note organization and presentation 
we are a diversified producer and marketer of coal to major us utilities and industrial users 
in  our total production was million tons and our total sales were million tons 
the coal we produced in was approximately low sulfur coal  medium sulfur coal and high sulfur coal 
at december   we had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland and west virginia 
we believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans 
in addition  there are substantial unleased reserves on adjacent properties that we intend to acquire or lease as our mining operations approach these areas 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage was consumed by electric utilities with the balance consumed by cogeneration plants and industrial users 
our largest customers in were aei  seminole  tva  and vepco 
we have had relationships with three of these customers for at least years 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage  including approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal sales tonnage  was sold under long term contracts 
the balance of our sales were made on the spot market 
our long term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices 
in  approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices  also known as scrubbers  to remove sulfur dioxide 
one of our business strategies is to continue to make productivity improvements to remain a low cost producer in each region in which we operate 
our principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits  equipment  materials and supplies  maintenance  royalties and excise taxes 
unlike most of our competitors in the eastern us  we employ a totally union free workforce 
many of the benefits of the union free workforce are not necessarily reflected in direct costs  but we believe are related to higher productivity 
in addition  while we do not pay our customers transportation costs  they may be substantial and often the determining factor in a coal consumer s contracting decision 
our mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern us we believe this gives us a transportation cost advantage compared to many of our competitors 
results of operations in comparing to and to  the partnership and predecessor periods for have been combined 
since the partnership maintained the historical basis of the predecessor s net assets  management believes that the combined partnership and predecessor results for are comparable with the interest expense associated with the debt incurred concurrent with the closing of the ipo is applicable only to the partnership period

compared with coal sales 
coal sales for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in the illinois basin operations and at the restructured pontiki operation  which were directly offset by planned reduced participation in low margin  coal export brokerage markets 
the brokerage business is not expected to be material in the future 
tons sold remained consistent at million for and tons produced decreased to million for from million for transportation revenues 
transportation revenues for decreased to million from million for the decrease of million was primarily attributable to planned reduced participation in coal export brokerage markets  which generally have higher transportation costs 
no margin is realized on transportation revenues 
other sales and operating revenues 
other sales and operating revenues increased to million for from million for the increase of million resulted from the introduction of a third party coal synfuel production facility at the hopkins county coal mining complex 
hopkins county coal provided the coal feedstock and received various fees for operating the third party s coal synfuel facility and providing other services 
we assisted the third party with marketing the coal synfuel and received a fee for such services 
synfuel shipments continue in on a month to month basis  currently contemplated through mid  with customer interest through however  future shipments are dependent upon  among other things  receiving a new favorable private letter ruling from the irs 
in late october  the irs issued rev 
proc 
 suspending issuance of private letter rulings for most coal synfuel plants while a review is conducted concerning whether current tax rules adequately address the evolving synfuel industry 
the irs requested public comment on rev 
proc 
by november  the irs indicated it will provide substantial guidance in the form of a general revenue ruling or a tax regulation to address tax credits granted under section of the internal revenue code 
until such guidance is received from the irs  we cannot give any assurance that future benefits will be received from the coal synfuel production facility 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million was a result of a start up expenses related to the opening of the newly developed gibson county coal mining complex during the fourth quarter of  b higher sales volumes in the illinois basin operations  c increased production volumes at the restructured pontiki operation  and d prolonged adverse mining conditions at the mettiki longwall mine 
transportation expenses 
see transportation revenues above concerning the decrease in transportation expenses 
outside purchases 
outside purchases declined to million for from million for the decrease of million was the result of lower coal export brokerage volumes 
see coal sales above concerning the decrease in coal export brokerage volumes 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were comparable for and at million 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense were comparable for and at million and million  respectively

unusual items 
the partnership was involved in litigation with seminole with respect to seminole s termination of a long term contract for the transloading of coal from rail to barge through the mt 
vernon terminal in indiana 
the final resolution between the parties  reached in conjunction with an arbitrator s decision rendered during the third quarter  included both cash payments and amendments to an existing coal supply contract 
the partnership recorded income of million  which is net of litigation expenses and impairment charges relating to certain mt 
vernon transloading facility assets 
additionally  the partnership recorded an expense of million related to other litigation matters 
the net effect of these unusual items was million 
see item financial statements 
note unusual items 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes was million for compared to million for the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a start up expenses related to the opening of the new gibson county coal mining complex during the fourth quarter of  b increased operating expenses as a result of prolonged adverse mining conditions encountered at the mettiki longwall mining complex and c additional interest expense associated with the debt incurred concurrent with the closing of the ipo  partially offset by unusual items recorded during see unusual items described above 
income tax expense 
the partnership s earnings or loss for federal income taxes purposes will be included in the tax returns of the individual partners 
accordingly  no recognition is given to income taxes in the accompanying financial statements of the partnership 
the predecessor was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of arh 
federal and state income taxes were calculated as if the predecessor had filed its return on a separate company basis utilizing an effective income tax rate of 
ebitda income from operations before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and depletion and amortization increased to million for compared with million for the million increase was primarily attributable to the unusual items recorded during  see unusual items described above  and the increased production and sales volumes at the restructured pontiki mine  which was partially offset by increased operating expenses as a result of adverse mining conditions at the mettiki longwall mining complex 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  income before income taxes  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda has not been adjusted for unusual items 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow and does not represent the measure of cash available for distribution  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make mqds 
the partnership s method of computing ebitda also may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies  or ebitda may be computed differently by the partnership in different contexts ie  public reporting versus computation under financing agreements 
compared with coal sales 
coal sales for declined to million from million for the decrease of million was primarily attributable to lower coal export brokerage volumes partially offset by improved results from the restructured pontiki mining complex and full year benefits from the capital invested at hopkins county coal 
the lower brokerage volumes were largely attributable to reduced participation in coal export brokerage markets 
the brokerage business is not expected to be material in the future 
because coal brokerage operations generate lower margins than direct coal sales  changes in the levels of brokerage activity have a greater impact on revenues and outside purchases than on margins 
tons sold decreased less than to million tons for from million tons for tons produced increased to million tons for from million tons for transportation revenues 
transportation revenues for decreased to million from million for the decrease of million was primarily attributable to planned reduced participation in coal export brokerage markets  which generally have higher transportation costs 
no margin is realized on transportation revenues 
other sales and operating revenues 
other sales and operating revenues declined to million for from million from the decrease of million was primarily due to lower volumes at the mt

unusual items 
in response to market conditions  the pontiki mining complex ceased operations and terminated substantially all of its workforce in september during the idle status period  which ended in november  pontiki incurred a net loss of approximately million consisting of estimated amounts for increased workers compensation claims of million and severance payments consistent with the worker adjustment and retraining notification act of million  as well as the costs associated with maintaining an idled mine of million 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes increased to million for compared to million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to improved productivity  which included the benefits of the restructured operation at pontiki following the idle status period of the mine  which resulted in the million unusual item recorded in as discussed above  and the capital investments at the hopkins county operation  partially offset by the losses incurred at mt 
vernon due to the dispute with seminole

income from operations before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  and depletion and amortization increased to million for compared with million for the million increase was attributable to the same factors that contributed to the increase in income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to the decrease in coal inventory of approximately million and the special gp retaining approximately million of trade receivables in conjunction with the ipo and concurrent transactions that occurred on august  net cash used in investing activities of million in was principally attributable to capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities of million for was principally attributable to capital expenditures and the purchase of us treasuries in conjuction with the ipo and concurrent transactions that occurred on august  net cash used in financing activities was million for compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for cash used in financing activities during was a direct result of four mqds paid in of per unit on common and subordinated units outstanding 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was principally attributable to net cash provided by the ipo and concurrent transactions that occurred on august capital expenditures capital expenditures increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the development of the new gibson county coal mining complex  which commenced production in november during  the partnership liquidated approximately million of us treasury notes to fund various qualifying capital expenditures with the remaining expenditures funded through cash generated from operations 
the partnership approved an extension of its existing pattiki mine into adjacent coal reserves 
the extension involves capital expenditures of approximately million during the period and is expected to allow the pattiki mine to continue its existing production level for the next years 
we currently expect that our average annual maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we currently expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and the utilization of the revolving credit facility described below 
notes offering and credit facility concurrently with the closing of the ipo  the special gp issued and the intermediate partnership assumed the obligations with respect to million principal amount of senior notes due august  senior notes 
the special gp also entered into  and the intermediate partnership assumed the obligations under a million credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility consists of three tranches  including a million term loan facility  a million working capital facility and a million revolving credit facility 
the partnership has borrowings outstanding of million under the term loan facility  but no borrowings outstanding under either the working capital facility or the revolving credit facility at december   and the weighted average interest rates on the term loan facility at december   and  was and  respectively 
the credit facility expires august the senior notes and credit facility are guaranteed by alliance coal  llc and all of its subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit facility is further secured by a pledge of treasury securities  which  upon written notice  are released for purposes of financing qualified capital expenditures of the intermediate partnership or its subsidiaries 
the senior notes and credit facility contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants  including the amount of distributions by the intermediate partnership and the incurrence of other debt 
accruals of other liabilities we had accruals for deferred credits and other liabilities  including current obligations  totaling million and million at december  and these accruals were chiefly comprised of workers compensation benefits  black lung benefits  and costs associated with reclamation and mine closing 
these obligations are self insured and were funded at the time the expense was incurred 
the accruals of these items were based on estimates of future expenditures based on current legislation and related regulations and other developments 
thus  from time to time  the partnership s results of operations may be significantly effected by changes to these deferred credits and other liabilities 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note reclamation and mine closing costs and note pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
we are required to pay black lung benefits to eligible and former employees under the blba 
we also are liable under various state statutes for similar claims 
we provide self insured accruals for these benefits 
we had accrued liabilities of million for these benefits at december   and we accrue for reclamation and mine closing costs 
we estimate the costs and timing of future reclamation and mine closing costs and record those estimates on a present value basis 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million at december  and for these costs 
we accrue for workers compensation claims resulting from traumatic injuries based on actuarial valuations and periodically adjust these estimates based on the estimated costs of claims made 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million at december  and for these costs 
inflation inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the partnership adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and be measured at fair value 
the partnership currently has no identified derivative instruments or hedging activities 
accordingly  this standard had no material effect on the partnership s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
during the fourth quarter  the partnership adopted financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
accordingly  the partnership reflects the cost of transporting coal to customers through third party carriers as transportation expenses and the corresponding reimbursement of these costs through customer billings as transportation revenues in the consolidated and combined statements of income 
these amounts were previously offset 
there was no cumulative effect on net income and the prior periods consolidated and combined statements of income have been reclassified to comply with this presentation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk almost all of the predecessor s transactions were  and almost all of the partnership s transactions are  denominated in us dollars  and as a result  the partnership does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
the partnership does not  engage in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions 
the intermediate partnership assumed obligations under the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are at variable rates and as a result the partnership has interest rate exposure 
the table below provides information about the partnership s market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
the fair values of long term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  based upon the partnership s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of december  and the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments are as follows in thousands fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate     weighted average interest rate term loan floating rate       weighted average interest rate fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate    weighted average interest rate term loan floating rate       weighted average interest rate
