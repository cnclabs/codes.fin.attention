liquidity and capital resources huttig has depended primarily on the cash generated from its own operations to finance its needs 
the combination of income from operations and cash generated from improved working capital management has been used to finance capital expenditures and seasonal working capital needs 
huttig s working capital requirements are generally greatest in the first eight months of the year and huttig generates cash from working capital reductions in the last four months of the year 
a continuing management focus to improve inventory turnover and accounts receivable and accounts payable days outstanding resulted in reduced working capital of million from december  to december  inventory turns averaged in compared to in and in prior to the spin off  to the extent internal funds generated were insufficient  huttig borrowed from crane and to the extent cash generated by huttig was greater than current requirements  the cash was returned to crane 
in particular  huttig historically had borrowed from crane to finance acquisitions  but has typically been able to generate cash sufficient to finance all other needs 
in  capital expenditures of million were financed from cash generated from operations 
during april  the company closed on a new million secured revolving credit facility 
the rate on the facility is libor plus a variable rate based on the company s ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
at december   the company had outstanding three interest rate swap contracts having a total notional amount of principal of million 
the swap contracts currently provide for a fixed weighted average rate of on million of the company s revolving credit borrowings 
the remainder of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are currently at a floating rate of libor plus basis points 
the proceeds from the million facility were used to retire a previously existing million facility and a million term loan 
in conjunction with the refinancing of the previously existing facility  the company recorded an extraordinary expense of million for the write off of unamortized loan fees 
huttig expects to continue to finance seasonal working capital requirements and acquisitions through cash from operations and the page of secured million credit facility 
cyclicality and seasonality huttig s sales depend heavily on the strength of the national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets 
the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects  which are a function of many factors beyond huttig s control  including interest rates  employment levels  availability of credit  prices of commodity wood products and consumer confidence 
future downturns in the markets that huttig serves could have a material adverse effect on huttig s operating results or financial condition 
in addition  because these markets are sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy in general  future downturns in the economy could have a material adverse effect on huttig s financial condition and results of operations 
huttig s first quarter and  to a lesser extent  its fourth quarter  are typically adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases 
because much of huttig s overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  its profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
the effects of winter weather patterns on huttig s business are offset somewhat by the increase in residential construction activity during the same period in the deep south  southwest and southern california markets in which huttig participates 
environmental regulation huttig is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
huttig has been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the clean up of contamination at two sites 
in addition  some of huttig s distribution centers are located in areas of current or former industrial activity where environmental contamination may have occurred  and for which huttig  among others  could be held responsible 
huttig does not believe that its contribution to the clean up of the two sites will be material or that there are any material environmental liabilities at any of its distribution center locations 
huttig believes that it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations regulating the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment 
however  there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on huttig s financial condition or results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk huttig has exposure to market risk as it relates to effects of changes in interest rates 
the company had million and of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the libor rate would have had an unfavorable impact of million on the company s earnings and cash flows during the year ended december  huttig s exposure to interest rate fluctuation is mitigated by the interest rate swap agreements it has in place 
the total notional amount of the swap agreements is million with a weighted average interest rate of huttig does not generate significant income from non us sources and accordingly  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not generally have a direct effect on huttig s financial position 
huttig is subject to periodic fluctuations in the price of wood commodities 
profitability is influenced by these changes as prices change between the time huttig buys and sells the wood 
in addition  to the extent changes in interest rates affect the housing and remodeling market  huttig would be affected by such changes
