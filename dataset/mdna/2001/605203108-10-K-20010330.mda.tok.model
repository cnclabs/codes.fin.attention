overview in may  we  the berg group members  john kontrabecki  and certain other persons entered into an acquisition agreement providing  among other things  for our acquisition of interests as the sole general partner in the operating partnerships 
at the time  the operating partnerships held approximately million rentable square feet of r d property located in silicon valley 
the agreement also provided for the parties to enter into the pending projects acquisition agreement  the berg land holdings option agreement and the exchange rights agreement  following stockholder approval 
effective july   we consummated our acquisition of the general partnership interests in the operating partnerships 
we effected our purchase of the general partnership interests by issuing to each of the operating partnerships a demand note bearing interest at per annum  aggregating million of principal payable no later than july  the demand notes 
effective july   all limited partnership interests in the operating partnerships were converted into  op units  representing ownership of approximately of the operating partnerships  upon consummation of the acquisition 
each op unit may be exchanged for one share of common stock pursuant to certain exchange rights and is treated as a share of common stock on a fully diluted basis and also represents our minority ownership interests 
at december   we owned a general partnership interest in the operating partnerships  taken as a whole  on a weighted average basis 
on december   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share to a number of accredited investors to complete our may private placements

however  the interest income earned by the operating partnerships  which is interest expense to us  in connection with this debt  is included in the calculation of minority interest as reported on the consolidated statement of operations  thereby reducing our net income by this same amount 
at present  our only means for repayment of this debt is through distributions received from the operating partnerships in excess of the amount of dividends to be paid to our stockholders

no portion of the distribution was paid on shares acquired by the berg group and its co investors 
in connection with that distribution  the amex halted trading of the common stock on october  neither the amex nor we set a deadline for the resumption of trading  nor did the amex provide guidance beyond declaring its desire that we have a firm commitment to acquire a controlling interest in the r d properties of the berg group and to raise additional capital

during  we reduced debt outstanding by utilizing proceeds from new borrowings  issuing  shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million and utilizing cash provided by operating activities 
capital expenditures the properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
for the years ended december  through december   the recurring tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions incurred with respect to new leases and lease renewals of the properties previously owned or controlled by members of the berg group averaged approximately million annually 
we will have approximately  rentable square feet under expiring leases from january  through december  we expect that the average annual cost of recurring tenant improvements and leasing commissions  related to these properties  will be approximately million during we believe we will recover substantially all of these sums from the tenants under the new or renewed leases through increases in rental rates 
until we actually sign the leases  however  we cannot assure you that this will occur 
capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required to be made to the properties 
tenant improvements and leasing costs may also fluctuate in any given period year depending upon factors such as the property  the term of the lease  the type of lease and the overall market conditions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by the company  but cannot be assured that we will be able to meet our requirements on favorable terms 
see policy with respect to certain activities financing policies 
funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo represents net income loss before minority interest of o 
p unit holders  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative for net income as a measure of profitability nor is it comparable to cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of funds available to meet our cash needs  including our need to make cash distributions to satisfy reit requirements 
our definition of ffo also assumes conversion at the beginning of the period of all convertible securities  including minority interests that might be exchanged for common stock 
our ffo does not represent the amount available for management s discretionary use  as such funds may be needed for capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
furthermore  ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define ffo exactly as we do 
ffo for the years ended december  and is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net income   add minority interest   depreciation   less gain loss on sale of security ffo   the minority interest for unrelated parties was deducted from total minority interest in calculating ffo 
overview of distribution policy we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of common stock based on our funds available for distribution fad  which is calculated as ffo less straight lined rents  leasing commissions paid and capital expenditures made during the respective period 
our ability to make such distributions will be affected by numerous factors including  most importantly  the receipt of distributions from the operating partnerships 
fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the actual return that we will realize and the amount available for distributions to stockholders will be affected by a number of factors  including the revenues received from our properties  our operating expenses  the interest expense incurred on borrowings and planned and unanticipated capital expenditures 
we anticipate that cash available for distribution will exceed earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes  as the latter figure takes into account non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  that we will incur 
distributions  other than capital gain distributions  by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes most likely will be taxable to us stockholders as ordinary dividend income unless a stockholder is a tax exempt entity 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non taxable reduction of the us stockholder s basis in the common stock to the extent of such basis  and thereafter as taxable gain 
the percentage of such distributions in excess of earnings and profits  if any  may vary from period to period 
distributions will be determined by our board of directors and will depend on actual fad  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
for a discussion of the risk that we will not meet our distribution objectives  see part i item business risk factors stockholders are not assured of receiving cash distributions from us 
the calculation of fad for the years ended december  and is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands ffo   less straight lined rents   leasing commissions  capital expenditures  fad   for year  the total distributions of per share of common stock are to be classified for income tax purposes as ordinary income 
distributions that are declared and recorded during the calendar year and paid within days of the end of the year are included in that year s distributions 
policies with respect to certain activities we have adopted policies with respect to investment  financing  conflicts of interest and other activities 
these policies have been formulated by our board of directors  are set forth in our charter  bylaws  operating partnership agreements or agreements with the berg group  and generally may be amended or revised from time to time  subject to applicable agreement terms  at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of the stockholders 
among other things  these policies provide that so long as the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  at least of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  which is calculated based on all outstanding shares of common stock and all shares of common stock that could be acquired upon the exercise of all outstanding options to acquire our voting stock  as well as all shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of all op units  the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee as a director  and of the holders of a majority of the op units is required for us to take title to assets  other than temporarily in connection with an acquisition prior to contributing such assets to the operating partnerships  or to conduct business other than through the operating partnerships  or for us or the operating partnerships to engage in any business other than the ownership  construction  development and operation of real estate properties  or for certain fundamental corporate actions  including amendments to our charter  bylaws or any operating partnership agreement and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of the operating partnerships  changes in certain policies with respect to conflicts of interest must be consistent with legal requirements  certain policies with respect to competition by the berg group are imposed pursuant to provisions of the acquisition agreement that cannot be amended or waived without the approval of the independent directors committee of our board of directors  we cannot take any action intended to terminate our qualification as a reit without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors  and we cannot undertake certain other specified transactions  including the issuance of debt securities  and borrowings in excess of specified limits  or the amendment of our charter and bylaws  without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors 
investment policies we expect to pursue our business and investment objectives principally through the direct ownership by the operating partnerships of our properties and future acquired properties 
development or investment activities are not limited to any specified percentage of our assets 
we may also participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures or other types of co ownership 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interests 
while we will emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion and subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification  invest in mortgage and other real estate interests  including securities of other real estate investment trusts 
we have not previously invested in mortgages or securities of other real estate investment trusts  and we do not have any present intention to make such investments 
financing policies to the extent that our board of directors determines to seek additional capital  we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings  debt financing or retention of cash flow  or through a combination of these sources  after consideration of provisions of the code requiring the distribution by a reit of a certain percentage of its taxable income and taking into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income 
it is our present intention that any additional borrowings will be made through the operating partnerships  although we may incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnerships 
borrowings may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property  and may have full or limited recourse to all or any portion of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property 
we have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole 
we may also determine to finance acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the issuance of additional op units in the operating partnerships  shares of common stock or other securities 
in the event that the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  it has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock  preferred stock or other capital stock  including securities senior to the common stock  in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that we issue any shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for  shares of common stock  subject to limited exceptions  such as the issuance of common stock pursuant to any stock incentive plan adopted by us or pursuant to limited partners exercise of the exchange rights or the put rights  the limited partners will have the right to purchase common stock or such securities in order to maintain their respective percentage interests in us on a fully diluted basis 
if the board of directors determines that we will raise additional equity capital to fund investments by the operating partnerships  we will contribute such funds to the operating partnerships as a contribution to capital and purchase of additional general partnership interest  however  holders of op units will have the right to participate in such funding on a pro rata basis 
in the event that holders of op units sell their op units to us upon exercise of their put rights  we are authorized to raise the funds for such purchase by issuing additional shares of common stock 
alternatively  we may issue additional shares of common stock in exchange for the tendered op units 
our board of directors also has the authority to cause the operating partnerships to issue additional op units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration  as it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that the operating partnerships issue new op units for cash  but not property  the limited partners holding op units in an operating partnership will have the right to purchase op units in order  and to the extent necessary  to maintain their respective percentage interests in that operating partnership 
the new op units will be exchangeable for common stock pursuant to the exchange rights or may be tendered to us pursuant to the put rights 
disposition policies we have no current intention of disposing of any of our properties  although we reserve the right to do so 
the tax basis of the limited partners in the properties in the operating partnerships is substantially less than current fair market value 
accordingly  prior to the disposition of their op units  upon a disposition of any of the properties  a disproportionately large share of the gain for federal income tax purposes would be allocated to the limited partners 
for a more detailed discussion of these tax effects  see federal income tax considerations tax aspects of the operating partnerships 
consequently  it may be in the interests of the limited partners that we continue to hold the properties in order to defer such taxable gain 
in light of this tax effect  the operating partnership agreements provide that  until january  or until the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  less than of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  which is calculated based on all outstanding shares of common stock and all shares of common stock that could be acquired upon the exercise of all outstanding options to acquire our voting stock  as well as all shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of all op units  if earlier  mr 
berg and clyde j 
berg may prohibit the operating partnerships from disposing of properties which they designate in a taxable transaction 
mr 
kontrabecki has a similar right with respect to seven of the properties  which right will lapse before the end of the ten year period if his beneficial ownership interest falls below  op units 
the limited partners may seek to cause us to retain the properties even when such action may not be in the interests of some  or a majority  of our stockholders 
the operating partnerships will be able to effect tax free  like kind exchanges under section of the code  or in connection with other non taxable transactions  such as a contribution of property to a new partnership  without obtaining the prior written consent of these individuals 
the approval of a majority of our directors  including mr 
berg or his designee  will be required to sell all or substantially all of our assets 
the consent of the holders of a majority of the op units will be required to effect a sale or sales of all  or substantially all  of the assets of any of the operating partnerships 
impact of recently issued accounting standards we do not believe that recently issued accounting standards will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and variable rate debt to finance our operations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our current and future debt obligations 
we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations of interest rates on our floating rate debt  and pricing on our future debt 
the following table provides information about the principal cash flows  weighted average interest rates  and expected maturity dates for debt outstanding as of december  the current terms of this debt are described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
average interest rates are based on implied libor for the respective time period 
fair value approximates book value for fixed rate debt 
of the projected fair value of secured notes payable  approximately million represents the prudential secured loan 
for variable rate debt  the table presents the assumption that the outstanding principal balance at december  will be paid upon maturity in march for fixed rate debt  the table presents the assumption that the outstanding principal balance at december  will be paid according to scheduled principal payments and that we will not prepay any of the outstanding principal balance 
thereafter total fair value variable rate debt dollars in thousands secured notes payable related parties    average interest rate fixed rate debt secured notes payable         average interest rate the variable rate debt represented and and the fixed rate debt represented and of all debt outstanding for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all of the debt is denominated in united states dollars 
the weighted average interest rate for variable rate debt was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate for fixed rate debt was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary market risk we face is the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
during  the primary market risk we faced was the market risk resulting from increasing libor based interest rates 
the berg group line of credit is tied to a libor based interest rate that was approximately million  or  of the total million of debt as of december  as a result  we pay lower rates of interest in periods of decreasing interest rates and higher rates of interest in periods of increasing interest rates 
at december   we had no interest caps or swaps
