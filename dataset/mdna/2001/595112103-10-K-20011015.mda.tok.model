results of operations amounts in millions except per share amounts net sales semiconductor operations    web hosting operations other consolidated net sales    operating income loss semiconductor operations  web hosting operations other operating income loss  income loss from continuing operations  net loss from discontinued pc operations net income loss  earnings loss per share from continuing operations diluted net income loss per share diluted activity in other primarily reflects transactions associated with residual assets from the company s former flat panel display and radio frequency identification devices operations that were effectively terminated in see notes to consolidated financial statements operating segment information 
net sales substantially all of the company s net sales for all periods presented were derived from semiconductor operations 
the company s results of operations for were significantly affected by a precipitous decline in average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products 
average selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products declined by approximately for as compared to  and decreased by approximately for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the decrease in average selling prices led to significantly lower net sales 
the decrease also led to charges to cost of goods sold for the write downs of the company s work in process and finished goods semiconductor memory inventories of million and million in the fourth and third quarters of  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of such inventories to their lower of cost or market value 
net sales decreased by for as compared to  primarily due to the significant decline in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor memory products 
megabit shipments increased by approximately for the same period 
the company achieved higher megabit sales for these comparative periods through ongoing transitions to smaller die size versions of existing memory products shrink versions  shifts to higher density products and increases in total wafer outs 
the company s primary memory product in was the meg synchronous dram sdram  which constituted of net sales 
the company s primary memory product in and was the meg sdram  which constituted and  respectively  of net sales 
the company s aggregate work in process and finished goods inventories of semiconductor memory products  as measured in megabits  increased approximately as of the end of compared to the prior year end 
this increase in inventory was primarily due to weak industry demand for memory products and increases in megabit production 
the increases in production resulted from increases in total wafer outs and ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiency and product and process transitions to next generation devices 
in addition  the consolidation of kmt s financial statements with those of the company contributed to the increase in inventory 
if industry demand for semiconductor memory products does not improve  the company s megabit inventories could continue to increase 
net sales increased by for as compared to  primarily due to a increase in total megabits of semiconductor memory sold and  to a lesser extent  a increase in average selling prices 
gross margin change change amounts in millions gross margin  as a of net sales substantially all of the company s gross margin for all periods presented was attributable to semiconductor operations 
the decrease in gross margin percentage for as compared to was principally due to the decrease in average selling prices per megabit of memory 
average selling prices for the company s memory products are currently below their manufacturing costs 
as a result  the company recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of to write down the carrying value of semiconductor memory inventories to their estimated market values 
the company incurred a similar write down of million in the third quarter of the company s gross margin percentage increased for as compared to  primarily due to decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs resulting from continued improvements in manufacturing efficiency and  to a lesser extent  a increase in average selling prices 
manufacturing cost improvements were achieved principally through transitions to shrink versions of existing products and shifts to higher density products 
subject to specific terms and conditions  the company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by its joint venture wafer fabrication facility  tech semiconductor singapore pte 
ltd 
tech 
tech supplied approximately  and of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in  and  respectively 
the company purchases semiconductor memory products from tech at prices determined quarterly  generally based on a discount from average selling price realized by the company for the immediately preceding quarter 
the company performs assembly and test services on products manufactured by tech 
the company also provides certain technology  engineering  and training support to tech 
all transactions with tech are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from tech 
the company realized lower gross margins on sales of tech products than for products manufactured by its wholly owned facilities in  and selling  general and administrative change change amounts in millions selling  general and administrative as a of net sales the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for as compared to resulted primarily from the contribution charge of million for the market value of the company s remaining equity interest in interland contributed to the foundation in the fourth quarter of the increase in sg a for as compared to was also due to increased legal costs associated with product and process technology rights litigation and patent prosecution and depreciation expense associated with the company s business software systems  partially offset by decreased performance based compensation expense 
see notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies 
the increase in sg a expenses for as compared to resulted primarily from increased employee compensation costs  attributable to higher levels of performance based pay and increased administrative personnel 
additionally  selling  general and administrative costs in included a million charge for the market value of interland common stock contributed by the company to the foundation  increased selling costs resulting from higher semiconductor production volumes and increased legal costs associated with product and process technology rights litigation and patent prosecution 
sg a for the company s web hosting operations  which were operated through mei  was  and of total sg a for  and  respectively 
research and development change change amounts in millions research and development as a of net sales research and development expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed  the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to is primarily due to an increased number of development wafers processed and higher compensation expenses reflective of an increased number of personnel 
process technology research and development efforts are focused on 
and 
line width process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company s transition to next generation products 
in addition to process technology  the company continues to emphasize product designs which utilize advanced process technology 
currently these designs include further shrink versions of the company s meg and meg sdrams 
efforts towards the design and development of new products are concentrated on the company s meg sdrams  ddr sdram  flash and sram memory products 
other research and development efforts are devoted to the design and development of embedded memory and advanced dram technology adt products 
the company is also developing technologies designed to enable customers to more rapidly adopt the company s advanced memory architectures 
other operating expense income other operating expense for includes losses of million from the write off of certain costs related to the company s lehi facility and losses of million  net of gains  on write downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment 
other operating income for includes a gain of million on the sale of the company s facility located in richardson  texas and losses of million  net of gains  on write downs and disposals of other semiconductor equipment 
other operating expense for includes charges of million relating to the company s former flat panel and radio frequency identification devices operations and losses of million  net of gains  from the write down and disposal of semiconductor equipment 
other non operating expense income other non operating expense for includes a million loss on mei stock issued to effect the interland merger and a charge of million to write down the carrying value of the company s equity interest in interland contributed to the foundation to market value 
in addition  the company recognized charges totaling million resulting from market value adjustments for derivative financial instruments to purchase electricity and natural gas 
other non operating income for includes a gain of million from the contribution to the foundation of interland common stock owned by the company 
interest income and expense interest income was higher for as compared to due to the company s higher levels of cash and liquid investments in interest expense was lower for as compared to  primarily as a result of the conversions of debt to equity in the third quarter of and the first quarter of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes were converted into equity in the third quarter of and the company s million face amount  convertible subordinated notes were converted into equity in the first quarter of income tax provision benefit the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate primarily reflects the statutory corporate income tax rate  the net effect of state taxes  the tax effect of earnings or losses by domestic subsidiaries not consolidated with the company for federal income tax purposes and the effect of foreign income at non us tax rates 
in addition  includes the benefit of a million change in the prior year s accrual for income taxes upon filing of the tax returns 
the company s future effective income tax rate will vary based on fluctuations in the mix of income and losses among tax jurisdictions with differing rates 
minority interests minority interests for  and includes minority shareholders interest in the spectek component recovery business and the web hosting operation 
the component recovery business was purchased by the company from mei on april   at which time it became a wholly owned operation of the company and  as a result  the company no longer recorded minority interest in the earnings of the component recovery business after april  approximately million  million and million of minority interest is attributable to the earnings of the component recovery business for  and  respectively

sfas no 
supersedes previous guidance for financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
the adoption of sfas no 
is effective for the company in the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products 
average selling prices have declined significantly in recent periods 
the company s principal source of liquidity during was net cash flow from operations of million which reflects a decrease in trade receivables  partially offset by an increase in the level of semiconductor memory inventories 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received million from the issuance of warrants to purchase its common stock 
during  the company expended  million for property  plant and equipment 
as of august   the company had cash and liquid investments totaling  million  representing a decrease of million from august  the deconsolidation of mei had the effect of decreasing cash and liquid investments by million  as mei s financial results are no longer consolidated into the company s financial results 
on april   the company completed the acquisition of kmt and  in connection therewith  the company assumed million in debt and capital lease obligations 
as of october   the company had received million of income taxes receivable reflected on the balance sheet date of august  in the first quarter of  the company s convertible subordinated notes due october  with a face amount of million  were converted into million shares of common stock  resulting in a reclassification of million from debt to equity 
the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  it must continue to invest in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
the company has historically utilized external sources of financing to fund operations and capital improvement projects and has a shelf registration statement in place pursuant to which the company may from time to time issue debt or equity securities for up to billion 
the company may also seek to raise funds through issuing securities not covered by the existing shelf registration statement 
the company expects capital spending to approximate billion in if market conditions do not improve and the company is unable to secure external financing  the company may be required to adopt various cash conservation measures  which may have an adverse impact on the company s future results of operations or financial position 
as of august   the company had commitments extending into of approximately million for equipment purchases and software infrastructure  and approximately million for the construction of facilities 
the company has pledged million as cash collateral to secure tech s fully drawn revolving line of credit 
certain factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
if average selling prices for our memory products do not increase significantly  we expect to continue to record significant losses average selling prices for our memory products in the fourth quarter of decreased approximately compared to the third quarter 
in four of the last five fiscal years we experienced decreases in average selling prices  as follows decline in  decline in  decline in and decline in we are unable to predict pricing conditions for any future period 
average selling prices for our memory products are currently below our manufacturing costs  and accordingly our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are being adversely affected 
if average selling prices do not improve to a level that exceeds cost  we would expect to continue to record significant losses on product sales 
in addition  to the extent the estimated market price of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarterly reporting date is below the cost of these products  we must recognize a charge against operations to write down the carrying value to market value 
if average selling prices of memory products do not improve to a level that exceeds our costs  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations or make adequate capital investments our cash flow from operations depends primarily on average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs of our semiconductor memory products 
average selling prices for our memory products are currently below our manufacturing costs 
to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  we must invest significant capital in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
if average selling prices do not improve to a level that exceeds our costs  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to sustain our operations 
current economic and political conditions may harm our business deteriorating global economic conditions and the effects of ongoing military actions against terrorists may cause significant disruptions to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business  results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected 
in addition  our ability to raise capital for purposes of research and development  capital expenditures and ongoing operations is dependent upon ready access to capital markets 
during times of adverse global economic and political conditions  investor confidence in and accessibility to capital markets could decrease 
if capital markets are not available to us over an extended period of time  we could be unable to fund operations  invest in capital expenditures and fully carry out our research and development efforts  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
if the current downturn in the semiconductor memory market persists  we may need to pursue cash conservation measures which may reduce the scale and efficiency of our operations if the current semiconductor industry downturn persists  we will be required to pursue cash conservation measures  including but not limited to  reductions in our capital spending and reductions in our workforce 
any such measures may reduce the scale and efficiency of our operations 
the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive some of our competitors receive government subsidies 
to the extent that these practices continue  they may have the result of prolonging the current imbalance in supply and demand in the semiconductor memory industry 
in addition  the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 
we face intense competition from a number of companies  including elpida memory  inc  hynix semiconductor  inc  infineon technologies ag and samsung semiconductor  inc some of these competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market  invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 
like us  these competitors aggressively seek to improve yields  reduce die size and decrease mask levels in their product designs 
these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressures on prices 
we are dependent on the personal computer pc market as most of the memory products we sell are used in pcs or peripherals 
if the growth rate of either pcs sold or the amount of memory included in each pc decreases  sales of our memory products could decrease in  we sold most of our memory products to pc or peripheral markets 
drams are the most widely used semiconductor memory components in pcs 
in recent periods  the growth rate of pcs sold has slowed significantly or declined 
in addition  the growth rate in for the average amount of memory included in each pc sold declined compared to several years prior to these declining growth rates affected our results of operations 
if we experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of either pcs sold or the average amount of memory included in each pc  sales of our memory products could decrease and our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if any one of our major pc customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we supply several major pc customers with more than of their memory requirements 
aggregate sales to three of our pc customers approximated of our net sales in if any one of our major pc customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
increased worldwide dram production could lead to further declines in average selling prices for dram we and our competitors constantly seek to improve yields  reduce die size and use fewer manufacturing steps 
these improvements increase worldwide supply of dram 
in addition  we and several of our competitors are evaluating plans to manufacture semiconductors in facilities that process millimeter mm wafers 
mm wafers have approximately greater usable surface area than mm wafers  the current industry standard 
the widespread use of mm wafers in the industry  which is expected to occur within the next two to five years  could lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of dram 
increases in worldwide supply of dram also result from dram fab capacity expansions  either by way of new facilities  increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to dram production 
increases in worldwide supply of dram  if not offset by increases in demand  could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if our tech joint venture experiences financial difficulty  or if our supply of memory products from tech is interrupted  our results of operations could be adversely affected tech currently supplies us with approximately of our total megabits of memory produced 
we have agreements to purchase all of the production from tech subject to specific terms and conditions 
any reduction in supply could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
tech has historically been required to seek additional external financing to fund its ongoing operations and transition to next generation technologies 
tech is expected to require financing in the immediate future in order to continue operations  therefore our source of supply may be interrupted if tech is unable to obtain required financing 
we have pledged million as cash collateral to secure current tech financing 
we may not be able to reduce per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past in recent years  we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our manufacturing processes  including reducing the die size of our existing products 
in future periods  we may not be able to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at historical rates 
our ability to reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in future periods may be affected because of the following our ability to complete product and process technology upgrades in our international and joint venture facilities  our manufacturing yields may decrease as we implement more complex technologies  our ability to ramp the latest reduced die size versions of existing devices or new generation devices to commercial volumes  or any reduction in the scale of our operations  which would result in losing economies of scale 
an adverse determination that our products and processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business  results of operation and financial condition from time to time  others have asserted  and may in the future assert  that our products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights 
in this regard  we are currently engaged in litigation with rambus  inc rambus relating to certain of rambus patents and certain of our claims and defenses 
lawsuits between rambus and us are pending in the united states  germany  france  the united kingdom and italy 
on august   we filed a declaratory judgment action against rambus in the us district court for the district of delaware 
on february   we amended our complaint 
pursuant to our complaint  we are seeking relief under the federal antitrust laws for violations by rambus of section of the sherman act  a declaratory judgment that a certain rambus patents are not infringed  are invalid and or are unenforceable  b we have an implied license to rambus patents  and c rambus is estopped from enforcing its patents against us because of its conduct in the joint electron device engineering council standards setting body  and damages and declaratory relief for rambus breach of contract  fraud  deceptive trade practices  negligent misrepresentation  and conduct requiring the application of equitable estoppel 
on february   rambus filed an answer and counterclaim 
rambus denies that we are entitled to relief and has alleged willful infringement by us of eight rambus patents 
we cannot predict the outcome of these suits 
a determination that our manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and or require us to make material changes to its products and or manufacturing processes 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements 
some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments 
we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 
we face risks associated with our foreign sales and operations that could adversely affect our operating results foreign sales approximated of our consolidated net sales in in addition  we have or support manufacturing operations in italy  singapore  japan and scotland 
our foreign sales and foreign operations are subject to a variety of risks  including currency fluctuations  export duties  changes to import and export regulations  and restrictions on the transfer of funds  political and economic instability  problems with the transportation or delivery of our products  employee turnover and labor unrest  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and compliance with a variety of foreign laws 
these factors may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
interruptions in our supply of raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards 
we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials  however  only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards 
various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers  photomasks  chemicals  gases  lead frames and molding compound 
in addition  any transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials 
although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted our operations in the past  shortages may occur from time to time in the future 
also  lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past 
if our supply of raw materials is interrupted or our lead times extended  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
products that do not meet specifications or that contain  or are rumored to contain  defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex  it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications  contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses 
if  despite design review  quality control and product qualification procedures  problems with nonconforming  defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products  we could be adversely affected in one or both of the following ways we may need to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product  and we may encounter adverse publicity  which could cause a decrease in sales of our products 
if our manufacturing process is interrupted  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance 
difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields or interrupt production and affect our ability to deliver products on time or cost effectively 
additionally  if production at a fabrication facility is interrupted for any reason  we may be unable to meet our customers demand and they may purchase products from other suppliers 
the resulting loss of revenues and damage to customer relationships could be significant 
if we are unable to successfully transition our operations to mm wafer manufacturing processes  the results of our operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we have in the past reduced our per megabit manufacturing costs by transitioning to larger wafer sizes 
by transitioning to larger wafers  we should be able to produce significantly more die for each wafer at a slightly higher cost for each wafer  resulting in substantially reduced costs for each die 
several of our competitors are evaluating plans to shift part or all of their memory manufacturing operations to mm wafers in the near future 
some of these competitors have established pilot mm wafer lines 
if these competitors are able to transition operations to mm wafers before us  we could be at a cost disadvantage 
our transition to mm wafer processing will require us to make substantial capital investments  which will depend on our ability to generate funds from operations or to obtain funds from external sources 
we may also experience disruptions in manufacturing operations and reduced yields during our initial transition stage to larger wafer sizes 
if we are unable to successfully transition to mm wafer processing at the appropriate time  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected
