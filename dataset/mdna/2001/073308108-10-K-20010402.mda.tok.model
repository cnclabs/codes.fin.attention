we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since the commencement of our online marketing business  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we had net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have been funded primarily through the issuance of preferred stock  borrowings  and public offerings of our common stock 
we raised net proceeds of million and million during our public offerings in november and in march  respectively 
on february   we acquired trivida in exchange for  shares of our common stock  net of an escrow claim of  shares 
in addition  we assumed options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the purchase price of million has been allocated to  of net liabilities and million of intangible assets  including goodwill 
the intangible assets are being amortized over three years which will result in amortization expense of approximately million per year 
we also incurred additional expenses totaling approximately  in primarily relating to employee severance and other restructuring charges in connection with the integration of trivida 
results of operations revenue through december   revenue has included bfast integration  monthly service and optional customer service fees and bselect fees

revenue increased to million in from million in as a result of providing services to additional new customers as well as increased volume from existing customers 
on an ongoing basis  we perform detailed analyses and monitor individual customer accounts to evaluate collectibility 
when we identify an account with a collection risk  we defer the related revenue until the collection of cash 
we did not incur any significant accounts receivable writeoffs during cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of expenses related to the operation of our hosting services 
these expenses primarily include depreciation and operating lease expense for systems and storage equipment  costs for third party data center facilities and costs for internet connectivity to our customers and their marketing partners

also included are the costs for marketing programs to promote our services to our current and prospective customers  as well as programs to recruit marketing partners for our current customers 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in approximately million of the increase was due to increased direct sales and telesales personnel and related expenses primarily resulting from the addition of new employees 
in addition  approximately  of the overall increase was spent to establish a recruitment program to assist customers in attracting marketing partners and approximately  related to incremental general marketing efforts 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in as the result of the establishment of direct sales and internal telesales groups and the use of third party public relations services 
client services expenses client services expenses primarily relate to the cost of assisting our customers in managing their relationships with marketing partners  as well as providing marketing integration  training and technical support to our customers

we also provide similar services to our customers affiliates on an optional basis for additional fees 
client services expense increased to million in from million in as a result of adding new employees to the client services group to support our growing customer base and to provide additional services to our existing customers 
client services expenses increased  to million in from  in as we began to develop a service function to provide support services for our growing customer base and the number of customers began to increase

the product development group designs and develops the underlying technologies for our services and the engineering group develops and manages the infrastructure necessary to support our services 
development and engineering expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to personnel and related cost increases of million resulting from the addition of new employees  including the employees assumed in the acquisition of trivida 
development and engineering expenses increased to million in from  in as a result of an increase in product development and engineering personnel 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses principally consist of payroll and related costs and professional fees related to our general management  finance and human resource functions 
general and administrative expenses increased by in to million from million in approximately million of the increase was due to the addition of new employees  and approximately million of the increase was due to an increase in professional service fees relating to legal and investor relations fees associated with our continued domestic and international growth 
additionally  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  in connection with our regular review of outstanding receivables and non income taxes increased by approximately  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from  in as a result of a million increase in personnel costs  including the costs associated with the addition of new employees  and a  increase in professional services fees associated with being a public company 
equity related compensation expenses equity related compensation expenses are noncash charges representing the difference between the exercise price of options to purchase common stock granted to our employees or the price paid for restricted stock sold to our employees and the fair value of these shares as of the date of grant  as determined for financial reporting purposes 
these expenses are recorded over the vesting period of the applicable option or stock award 
these expenses also include the fair value of options granted to consultants as of the date of grant  as determined for financial reporting purposes 
these fair values were determined in accordance with accounting principles board opinion and statement of financial accounting standards equity related compensation expenses were million in  million in and million in on january   we issued  shares of restricted stock to employees who had previously requested to participate in a stock for options benefit program the program 
under the provisions of the program  participating employees exchanged two stock options issued under be free s stock incentive plan for one share of restricted stock with a purchase price of per share 
the first of the restricted stock purchased vests months from the original stock option grant date 
an additional vests each year after the first vest date  for the next three years 
in connection with the program  the company will record unearned compensation for restricted stock granted to employees below fair market value of up to million 
the company will recognize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the restricted stock 
amortization and merger related expenses amortization and merger related expenses of million are the result of the acquisition of trivida in february these expenses include  of one time acquisition related costs  primarily for employee severance  and million of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired 
we are amortizing the intangible assets acquired  which total million  on a straight line basis over three years and expect to recognize amortization expense of approximately million per quarter through february we periodically evaluate the potential impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets resulting from acquisitions 
we evaluated whether the intangible assets  including goodwill  have been impaired and perform these evaluations on a quarterly basis 
we have not identified an impairment at december  in future periods  our evaluations may result in all or a portion of the intangible assets being written off 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net consists of interest income earned on our cash and marketable securities balances partially offset by interest expense on our borrowings 
net interest income of million in resulted from interest income of million from the investment of a portion of the proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings which was partially offset by interest expense on lease obligations of  net interest income of  was recognized in interest income of million in from the investment of a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering was partially offset by interest expense of  relating to debt obligations 
net interest expense of  was recognized in extraordinary item the balance of deferred financing costs of  associated with a million subordinated debt financing resulted in an extraordinary loss upon the early extinguishment of the debt in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million at december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
in  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million and marketable securities increased by million 
this reflects our continued efforts to invest excess cash  obtained primarily through our public offerings  in marketable securities which yield a higher return than cash and cash equivalents 
cash used in operating activities was million in this use of cash resulted from our net loss of million which included million in noncash depreciation and amortization expense and million in equity related compensation  an increase in accounts receivable of million  a cash use for accounts payable totaling million and an increase of other assets of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to the growth in our customer base and a deterioration of our accounts receivable aging 
the deterioration is attributable to longer payment cycles experienced from some of our customers 
on an ongoing basis  we perform detailed analyses and monitor individual customer accounts to evaluate collectibility and establish a provision for doubtful accounts 
revenue is deferred when collection is not reasonably assured 
we believe that the increase in the collection period of our accounts receivable does not indicate a significant increase in the collection risk associated with our accounts receivable balances 
the use of cash resulting from the increase in other assets is primarily attributable to interest receivable from investments in marketable securities 
the cash used in accounts payable was primarily due to the payment of liabilities assumed in the acquisition of trivida  offset by timing differences in vendor payments 
these amounts were partially offset by cash provided from the increase in accrued expenses of approximately million primarily resulting from timing differences in the processing of the payment of our merchants partner commissions which were made subsequent to december  cash used in investing activities was million in purchases and sales of marketable securities in totaled million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures totaled million in these capital expenditures were largely related to the purchase of additional system and storage equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million in this cash was provided through the issuance of common stock in our secondary offering in exchange for net proceeds of million  proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the employee stock purchase plan and exercise of options and warrants totaling million and payments on notes receivable from stockholders of  these amounts were partially offset by payments on capital lease arrangements totaling million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and borrowings will be sufficient to meet our debt service  operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
while we do not anticipate that this would be necessary  if cash were insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to raise additional funds through additional borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value

we will adopt sfas no

 in fiscal year factors that may affect future results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results 
our limited operating history makes the evaluation of our business and prospects difficult we introduced our first online marketing services and recorded our first revenue from these services in the third quarter of accordingly  you have limited information about our company with which to evaluate our business  strategies and performance and an investment in our common stock 
before buying our common stock  you should consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  particularly those companies whose business depends on the internet 
we have a history of losses and expect future losses our accumulated deficit as of december  was million 
our current business has never achieved profitability and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future in light of the level of our amortization of intangible assets and planned operating and capital expenditures 
as a result of our acquisition of trivida  we currently expect to record amortization expense of approximately million per year during the next three years 
we also expect to experience negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted in a timely manner  our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects would be materially and adversely affected 
to support our current and future lines of business  we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing  including an expansion of those functions in europe 
we also intend to increase our expenditures relating to technology  infrastructure and client services and product development activities 
the timing of our investments and expansion could cause material fluctuations in our results of operations 
we also plan to purchase additional capital equipment  which will result in additional depreciation expense 
our losses will increase in the future  in part because of the amortization of intangible assets  and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 
we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if the internet fails to grow as an advertising  marketing and sales medium  our future revenue and business prospects would be materially and adversely affected our future revenue and business prospects depend in part on a significant increase in the use of the internet as an advertising  marketing and sales medium 
internet advertising and marketing is new and rapidly evolving  and it cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media or marketing programs to gauge its effectiveness 
as a result  demand for and market acceptance of internet advertising and marketing solutions are uncertain 
further  the internet is still emerging as a significant channel for selling goods and services to consumers 
our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected if the internet does not become further accepted as an advertising and marketing medium or if consumers do not increasingly purchase goods and services online 
the adoption of internet advertising and marketing services  particularly by entities that have historically relied upon more traditional methods  requires the acceptance of a new way of advertising and marketing 
these customers may find internet advertising and marketing to be less effective for meeting their business needs than other methods of advertising and marketing 
because our business model is new and unproven  we do not know if we will generate significant revenue on a sustained basis or achieve profitability substantially all of our revenue is derived from a new business model 
our revenue depends on whether the online marketing that we facilitate generates sales or traffic for our customers 
in contrast  others earn fees based merely on placing online advertisements for customers 
our customers marketing partners may not generate substantial volumes of sales or traffic for our customers 
similarly  our customers product and service offerings may not be sufficient to attract or retain their marketing partners 
in these situations  we may lose revenue and  ultimately  customers 
if the assumptions underlying our business model are not valid or we are unable to implement our business plan  achieve the predicted level of market penetration or obtain the desired level of pricing of our services for sustained periods  our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
system disruptions and failures may result in customer dissatisfaction  customer loss or both  which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business the continued and uninterrupted performance of the computer systems used by us  our customers and their marketing partners is critical to our success 
customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them 
these failures could affect our ability to deliver and track promotions quickly and accurately to the targeted audience and deliver reports to our customers and their marketing partners 
sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our services significantly 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our computer systems against damage from fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failures  vandalism and similar unexpected adverse events 
in addition  interruptions in our services could result from the failure of telecommunications providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time required 
our critical computer hardware and software is housed at exodus communications  inc  a third party provider of internet hosting and communication service 
any system wide failure by us or exodus  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  despite our efforts to implement network security measures  our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering 
we do not carry enough business interruption insurance to compensate for any significant losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
we have experienced systems outages in the past  during which we were unable to route transactions to our customers from their marketing partners or provide reports 
we expect to experience additional outages in the future 
to date  these outages have not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in the future  a prolonged system wide outage or frequent outages could cause harm to our reputation and could cause our customers or their marketing partners to make claims against us for damages allegedly resulting from an outage 
the expansion of our existing data centers and the opening of additional data centers may not eliminate systems outages or prevent the loss of sales when system outages occur 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations could result in material harm to our business and expose us to material liabilities 
intense competition in our markets may reduce the number of our customers and the pricing of our services we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we compete against larger public companies as well as against similar sized  private companies 
we face competition in the online marketing services market in general  as well as in the affiliate marketing program and site personalization segments specifically 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition from current and potential competitors 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
in addition  our current and potential competitors may bundle their products with other marketing software or services in a manner that may discourage users from purchasing services offered by us 
also  many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
some customers may regard information about their online sales and traffic to be too sensitive to share with anyone outside their company  including be free 
if this view became widespread  our business and prospects would be materially and adversely affected our services require our customers to permit us access to their catalog  transactional and fulfillment systems  so we can track  store and analyze the sales and traffic that result from their promotions on their marketing partners internet sites 
some online customers may regard this information as too important from a business or competitive perspective to share with any third party  including be free 
if this view became widespread  businesses might forgo our marketing services entirely or seek to establish and manage their own marketing services using internal resources 
this would materially and adversely affect our business and prospects 
any breach of our system s security measures that results in the release of confidential customer data could cause customer dissatisfaction  customer loss  or both and expose us to lawsuits third parties may attempt to breach our security 
if they are successful  they could obtain our customers or their marketing partners confidential information  including marketing data  sales data  passwords  and financial account  performance and contact information 
a breach of security could materially and adversely affect our reputation  business and prospects 
we rely on encryption technology licensed from third parties 
our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss or theft of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
we may be liable for any breach in our security and any breach could harm our reputation  reduce demand for our services or cause customers to terminate their relationships with us 
if our system produces inaccurate information  we may experience customer dissatisfaction  customer loss  or both and be exposed to lawsuits software defects or inaccurate data may cause incorrect recording  reporting or display of information to our customers  their marketing partners or both 
inaccurate information could cause our customers to over pay or under pay their marketing partners 
as a result  we could be held liable for any damages incurred by our customers or their marketing partners 
in addition  we provide an optional payment service for our customers 
software defects and inaccurate data may cause us to send payments to the wrong party  in the wrong amounts  or on an untimely basis  any of which could cause liability for us  lead to customer dissatisfaction  or both 
our services depend on complex software that we have internally developed or licensed from third parties 
software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released  which can adversely affect performance or result in inaccurate data 
we may not discover software defects that affect our new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
in addition  our services depend on our customers and their marketing partners supplying us with data regarding contacts  performance and sales 
they may provide us with erroneous or incomplete data 
to be competitive  we must continue to develop new and enhanced services  and our failure to do so may adversely affect our prospects our market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new service introductions  change in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing services obsolete 
our revenue growth depends upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new services and service enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we have experienced delays in releasing new services and service enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
to date  these delays have not had a material effect on our business 
if we experience material delays in introducing new services and enhancements  customers may forgo purchasing or renewing our services and purchase those of our competitors 
if government regulations and legal uncertainties related to doing business on the internet cause a decline in e commerce and internet advertising and marketing  our business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and marketing are becoming more prevalent 
the united states congress has enacted internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights and taxation 
other laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  content  taxation and quality of products and services  among other items 
the governments of states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where legislation has been enacted 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising and marketing services 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
the internet generates privacy concerns which could result in market perceptions or legislation which could harm our business  result in reduced sales of our services  or both we gather and maintain anonymous data related to consumer online browsing and buying behavior 
when a user first views or clicks on a customer s promotion managed by our system  we create an anonymous profile for that user and we add and change profile attributes based upon that user s behavior on our customer s internet site and its marketing partners internet sites 
privacy concerns may cause visitors to avoid internet sites that track behavioral information and even the perception of security and privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our services 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify users that the data captured after visiting internet sites may be used to direct product promotions and advertising to that user 
for example  the united states and the european union recently enacted privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of some user information 
the united states and other countries may adopt additional legislation or regulatory requirements 
if privacy legislation is enacted or consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
to date  these regulations and privacy concerns have not materially restricted the use of our services or our business growth 
however  they may limit our ability to utilize the personalization technology that we obtained through our acquisition of trivida or our ability to expand successfully our operations in europe and in other foreign countries 
if a significant number of internet users use software to block online advertising  our business and prospects could decline materially software programs exist that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a user s computer 
widespread adoption of this software by internet users would significantly undermine the commercial viability of internet advertising and marketing 
this development could cause our business and prospects to decline materially 
if a significant number of internet users opt out of online profiling or use software to prevent online profiling  our business prospects could decline materially we gather and maintain anonymous data related to consumer online browsing and buying behavior 
when a user first views or clicks on a customer s promotion managed by our system  we create an anonymous profile for that user and we add and change profile attributes based upon that user s behavior on our customer s internet site and its marketing partners internet sites 
we host an internet site which allows consumers to opt not to have their anonymous profile gathered and maintained by us 
also  software programs exist that limit or prevent the use of cookies which are required for us to gather the anonymous data 
widespread use of the opt out capability or adoption of this software by internet users could significantly undermine the commercial viability of our bselect onsite service 
this development could cause our business prospects to decline materially 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law and assignment of invention and confidentiality agreements 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
if this occurs  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we have also filed applications to register various servicemarks 
we cannot assure you that any of our servicemark registrations will be approved 
if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  we could be exposed to significant liability we cannot assure you that our patent or any future patents or servicemark registrations we receive will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we do not infringe any intellectual property rights of third parties or that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
there have been a number of patents granted relating to online commerce  advertising and affiliate marketing programs 
further  we believe that an increased number of such patents may be filed in the future 
to date  we have not been notified that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  but in the future third parties may claim that we infringe on their past  current or future intellectual property rights 
any such claim brought against us or our customers  whether meritorious or not  could result in loss of revenue  be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
if we were unable to enter into such royalty or licensing agreements  it could result in the significant modification or cessation of our business operations 
if we are not able to overcome the challenges of our planned international expansion  our revenue and our prospects for profitability may be materially and adversely affected we are expanding  and plan to continue to expand  our international operations and international sales and marketing efforts 
to date  we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our services and in marketing  selling and distributing our services internationally 
we provide online marketing services for several customers in europe and we intend to offer our services in additional european countries 
our success in these markets will depend on the success of our customers in these countries 
international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including 
the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  
changes in regulatory requirements  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  
political and economic instability  
compliance with foreign regulations regarding internet privacy concerns  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and 
seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and some other parts of the world 
we may not achieve the expected benefits of our acquisition of trivida in february  we acquired trivida  a provider of personalization services to online merchants and content sites 
in june  we introduced bselect onsite  our first service utilizing trivida s personalization technology 
our failure to successfully address the challenges associated with this acquisition  including the further development and integration of these services with our existing services  could have a material adverse affect on our ability to market services based on these personalization technologies 
we plan to devote significant resources to the development of personalization services 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market personalization services  we may not achieve enhanced revenue and other anticipated benefits from the trivida acquisition 
the success of this acquisition will depend on 
the acceptance of personalization services in online marketing among online merchants  their marketing partners and internet users  
the addition of new functionality to the trivida product 
retaining the software developers and other key employees of trivida  and 
developing  integrating and marketing personalization services  our failure to successfully address these factors may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  including a reduction in our intangible assets  and could result in a decline in our common stock price 
we depend on a limited number of hardware and software vendors for essential products 
if we were unable to purchase or license these essential products on acceptable terms or if we had to obtain substitutes for these essential products from different vendors  we might suffer a loss of revenue due to business interruption and might incur higher operating costs 
we buy and lease hardware  including our servers and storage arrays from sun microsystems and emc corporation 
we also license software  including our servers operating systems  internet server technology  database technology  graphical user interface technology and encryption technology  primarily from sun microsystems  microsoft corporation  oracle corporation and powersoft 
if these vendors change the terms of our license arrangements with them so that it would be uneconomical to purchase our essential products from them  or if they were unable or unwilling to supply us with a sufficient quantity of properly functioning products  our business could be materially and adversely affected due to business interruption caused by any delay in product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified and the cost of integrating new technology 
we may be exposed to liability for information displayed on our customers internet sites or within their marketing partners internet sites because the provision of our services requires us to provide a connection to the internet sites of our customers and their marketing partners  we may be perceived as being associated with the content of these internet sites 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by our customers and their marketing partners 
as a result  we may face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the materials displayed on our customers sites and on their marketing partners sites and e mail messages 
for example  if one of our customers is sued for posting information on its internet site that is alleged to be defamatory  we may also be named as a defendant in that legal action based solely on our limited association with that customer s internet site 
as a result  we could be involved in legal proceedings and disputes that are costly to resolve  regardless of their lack of merit 
we may also suffer a loss of customers or reputational harm based on this information or resulting from our involvement in these legal proceedings 
furthermore  some foreign governments have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the united states 
our insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
there is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims  if successfully asserted against us  could exceed the total of our coverage limits 
there is also a risk that a single claim or multiple claims asserted against us may not qualify for coverage under our insurance policies as a result of coverage exclusions that are contained within these policies 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate and the price of our common stock could fall if quarterly results are lower than the expectations of securities analysts or stockholders we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
if our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or stockholders  however  the price of our common stock could fall 
we have experienced significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results and may continue to experience significant fluctuation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of two years or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material
