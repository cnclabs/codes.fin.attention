due to the short term maturities of our investments  we believe there is no significant risk arising from interest rate fluctuations 
we are actively managing our investment portfolios to increase return on investments  but  in order to ensure safety and liquidity  will only invest in instruments with credit quality and which are traded in a secondary market 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies
