for a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value would be recorded in earnings immediately 
if the derivative is designated in a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recorded in earnings

seasonality the company s combined business is modestly seasonal overall 
the greatest seasonalities exist with the dealerships in the northeast united states  for which the second and third quarters are the strongest with respect to vehicle related sales

effects of inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenue or profitability 
the company does not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of its products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 
the company finances substantially all of its inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on the prime rate or libor 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation 
the company does not believe that it would be placed at a competitive disadvantage should interest rates increase due to increased inflation since most other automobile dealers have similar floating rate borrowing arrangements

based on the average aggregate outstanding amounts under floor plan financing arrangements during the year ended december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to the company s annual floor plan interest expense 
during  the company entered into swap agreements pursuant to which a notional million of the company s floating rate debt has been exchanged for fixed rate debt for a period of five years 
the fixed rate interest to be paid by the company is based on libor  as adjusted  and amounts to approximately 
for fixed rate debt including the notes  certain seller financed promissory notes and obligations under certain capital leases  interest rate changes effect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact the company s earnings or cash flows
