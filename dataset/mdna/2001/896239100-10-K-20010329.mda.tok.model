item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent business developments effective as of july   trimble completed the acquisition of the spectra precision wholly owned businesses formerly owned by thermo electron corporation thermo electron  collectively known as the spectra precision group for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  subject to a final adjustment in the purchase price as provided for in the acquisition agreements 
the acquisition included of the stock of spectra precision inc  a delaware corporation  spectra precision srl  an italian corporation  spectra physics holdings gmbh  a german corporation  and spectra precision bv  a netherlands corporation 
the acquisition also consisted of certain assets and liabilities of spectra precision ab  a swedish corporation  including of the shares of spectra precision sa  a french corporation  spectra precision scandinavia ab  a swedish corporation  spectra precision of canada ltd  a canadian corporation  and spectra precision handelsges mbh  an austrian corporation 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of how this acquisition was financed 
the spectra precision group develops instruments and systems that provide positioning solutions for two market segments  engineering construction and agriculture 
within those segments are four major customer applications surveying  construction site positioning  construction and agricultural machine control  and software 
spectra precision group products generally measure distances very accurately by means of a light beam 
in addition  they have capabilities that provide the capability to uniquely solve positioning problems such as the determination of angles with high accuracy 
the company expects that the acquisition of the spectra precision group will strengthen trimble s position as a leading provider of positioning solutions worldwide 
the acquisition also gives trimble one of the most comprehensive product portfolios in the industry  strengthens its distribution network  and serves as a platform for future growth 
the complementary product lines and technologies of trimble and the spectra precision group  should help the combined company to become a leader in the engineering and construction  agriculture  and fleet and asset management market segments 
in addition  the spectra precision group s well established and extensive distribution network should extend trimble s reach into new segments of its target market segments both domestically and internationally 
although there was very little overlap between each of the companies product offerings  two areas of overlap were identified and the company has announced plans to discontinue trimble s tts optical survey family and the spectra precision group s elta and geotracer gps receivers 
as part of the acquisition of the spectra precision group  trimble has identified approximately million of annual cost synergies 
we expect to realize to million of these benefits in fiscal and realize the full benefit in fiscal and beyond 
however  the company is still in the early stages of combining trimble and the spectra precision group and this involves certain inherent risks  including the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value  diversion of management s attention  difficulties in coordinating the management of operations at new sites  and the possible loss of key employees of acquired operations 
the company s profitability may suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage this acquisition  or if we do not generate sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses associated with this acquisition 
trimble s current strategy for the on going integration of the spectra precision group is to focus on leveraging existing technologies  distribution  and marketing resources and identifying and taking advantage of synergies between the companies 
the company s initial priorities for the combined entities are centered on the following o the reconciliation and alignment of distribution channels and the achievement of our market targets and cost synergies 
the largest portion of the cost synergies result from the consolidation of redundant facilities 
o defining the basic corporate organization  reporting and structure 
this included the announcement by trimble in august of its new segment and management organization 
as part of the august announcement  the engineering and construction division of trimble is headquartered from our dayton  ohio facility 
trimble s agriculture and component technologies divisions continue to operate from our sunnyvale  california facility 
the mobile positioning and communications market of the fleet and asset management division is headquartered from our sunnyvale  california facility 
the gis market of the fleet and asset management division is headquartered in new zealand 
o coordinating manufacturing facilities 
the manufacturing facilities acquired  as a result of the acquisition of the spectra precision group  support the engineering and construction divisions and report through that segment management 
as part of integrating the two companies  trimble reorganized management responsibilities in the third quarter of fiscal year by realigning its reportable market segments from the previous two segments precision positioning group ppg and mobile timing and technologies group mtt to five segments i engineering and construction  ii agriculture  iii fleet and asset management  iv component technologies  and v portfolio technologies 
the engineering and construction segment includes the spectra precision group surveying and construction markets and the land survey  marine survey  mining and construction markets that had been under trimble s ppg segment 
the agriculture segment includes the spectra precision group agriculture market and the agriculture market that had been under trimble s ppg segment 
the fleet and asset management segment includes the mapping and gis market that had been under trimble s ppg segment  as well as  the mobile positioning market that had been under trimble s mtt segment 
the component technologies segment includes the embedded  ivn and timing markets that had been under trimble s mtt segment 
the portfolio technologies segment includes air transport  military  commercial marine and advance technology markets that had been under trimble s mtt segment 
in the engineering and construction segment  we focus on centimeter positioning  data collection management  wireless communication  and machine guidance and control 
in the agriculture segment we focus on precise machine guidance  yield monitoring  variable rate application of fertilizer and chemicals  and water management 
in the fleet and asset management segment we focus on asset tracking  fleet management  intelligent transportation systems  and public safety through integration of our technologies  information technology and wireless communication 
in the component technologies segment we provide our gps technology to various applications automotive navigation  and timing systems for oems 
we intend to establish and sustain our leadership position in each of these market segments by offering products that are differentiated by unique product capabilities provided by our positioning technology  complemented by the additional value provided by our software and finally by the value provided by our distribution channels in providing high quality service and support 
in many cases  we emphasize application specific systems that solve end user problems in its targeted market segments 
effective as of november   trimble completed the acquisition of tripod data systems  inc  an oregon corporation for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  which is subject to a final adjustment in the purchase price as provided for in the acquisition agreements 
the purchase price was in the form of shares of the common stock of trimble 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
tripod data systems operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of trimble 
tripod data systems is a leading developer of data collection software for the land survey  construction and gis markets 
tripod data systems has three core business components 
the company develops software for data collection applications  manufactures rugged windows ce based handheld data collectors such as their tds ranger  and develops software for pen computer applications 
the company expects that the acquisition of tripod data systems will strengthen trimble s ability to aggressively address a number of targeted markets including land survey  construction and gis 
on march   the company sold its air transport systems ats business to honeywell 
the ats business was a part of our portfolio technologies segment 
the sale to honeywell consisted of the trimble  the ht and two other product lines  which were included in the ats business 
results excluding one time  acquisition  and discontinued operation adjustments the income from operations measurement utilized by management excludes certain one time and acquisition related charges and discontinued operations adjustments that management believes are not reflective of on going operations

o these increases were partially offset due to continued delivery problems related to critical part shortages in our supply chain 
engineering and construction revenues decreased in fiscal from fiscal the decrease is due to the following o sales were impacted from the change in commission structure for some of our products from commission dealers to buy sell dealers in fiscal under the buy sell arrangement  the product is discounted to the dealer  as opposed to end user pricing with commissions recorded under sales and marketing expense 
o in the fourth quarter of  delivery problems due to critical part shortages in our supply chain  and transitional issues with outsourcing our manufacturing  had a negative impact on revenue for the fiscal year ended agriculture agriculture revenues increased by in fiscal over fiscal the increase in revenue compared to is due to the following o revenues generated since the purchase of the spectra precision group in july  which accounted for approximately million for the period july  through december  o introduction of new products  including the aggps field computer  the aggps  and the pso plus parallel swathing option with data logging 
o strong growth in demand for gps agriculture products in general 
o these increases were partially offset due to continued delivery problems related to critical part shortages in our supply chain 
agriculture revenues were not broken out separately for fiscal year because it is impracticable to do so 
therefore there is no comparison of the increase in revenue in the agriculture segment from fiscal to fiscal the results of this division were included in the engineering and construction segment for fiscal fleet and asset management fleet and asset management revenues decreased by in fiscal over fiscal the revenue change compared to is due to the following o asset management and tracking product revenues were down due to continued delivery problems related to critical part shortages in our supply chain 
o these decreases were partially offset by increased demand in our mapping products  especially our new geoexplorer used for gis data collection and data maintenance 
in addition  unit sales for our crosscheck family of products increased by over prior year 
fleet and asset management revenues increased by in fiscal from fiscal the increase is due primarily to the growth of revenue in our pathfinder proxr and pathfinder proxrs products  based on volume growth 
component technologies component technologies revenues increased by in fiscal over fiscal the revenue change compared to is due to the following o strong demand for gps embedded applications such as vehicle tracking and safety and security 
o the above increases were partially offset by continued delivery problems related to critical part shortages in our supply chain 
component technologies revenues increased by in fiscal from fiscal the increase is due primarily to strong growth in our automotive and timing markets 
portfolio technologies portfolio technologies revenues decreased by in fiscal over fiscal the revenue decrease compared to is due to the following o decreases in revenues for military and air transport products 
o trimble s decision to exit the commercial marine business in the fourth quarter of and the sale of the last of such products in the second quarter of portfolio technologies revenues decreased by in fiscal from fiscal the decrease is due to the following o trimble decided to exit the commercial marine business in the fourth quarter of and sold the last of such products in the second quarter of o commercial air transport was down  due to decreases in market demand and the successful conclusion of shipments in fiscal to american airlines and continental airlines through our honeywell alliance  which were not repeated in fiscal o military systems declined due to the completion of our cugr contract in the first quarter of which sales were not repeated in export sales 
export sales from domestic operations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in  and in sales to unaffiliated customers in foreign locations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in  and in trimble anticipates that export revenue and sales made by its subsidiaries in locations outside the us will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue 
for this reason  trimble is subject to the risks inherent in these sales  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval  and tariffs or other barriers 
even though the us government announced on march   that it would support and maintain the gps system  and on may  eliminated the use of selective availability s a a method of degrading gps accuracy there may be a reluctance in certain foreign markets to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
trimble s results of operations could be adversely affected if the company were unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us no single customer  including the us government and its agencies  accounted for or more of the company s total revenues in  or it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by the company may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin varies due to a number of factors  including product mix  domestic versus international sales  customer type  the effects of production volumes and fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs  and new product start up costs 
the gross margin percentage on product sales  not including a million charge for inventory purchase accounting adjustments for the acquisition of the spectra precision group  was in and for  compared with in fiscal the fiscal gross margin percentage increased over fiscal year due to the favorable product mix of engineering and construction and agriculture products  which yield higher margins through the integration of software and wireless communications 
in addition  it was favorably impacted by the cost benefits of outsourcing our manufacturing to solectron 
these increases were partially offset by higher costs to acquire components due to the worldwide component shortages 
the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflect improved manufacturing cost controls achieved through the consolidation of the manufacturing organization  resulting in improved efficiencies and reduced inventory 
in addition gross margins in the second half of fiscal were favorably impacted by the cost benefits of outsourcing our manufacturing to solectron 
because of product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors  current level gross margins cannot be assured 
trimble expects that in the future a higher percentage of its business will be conducted through alliances with strategic partners 
as a result of volume pricing and the assumption of certain operating costs by the partner  margins on this business are likely to be lower than sales directly to end users 
operating expenses 
the following table shows operating expenses for the periods indicated 
it should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below fiscal years ended december  december  january  in thousands research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    restructuring charges  amortization of goodwill other purchased intangibles  total    research and development 
research and development spending increased in absolute dollars during fiscal  representing of revenue  compared with in and in the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in are due primarily to the purchase of the spectra precision group in july  which accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the increase was also due to approximately million less of cost reimbursement funds received for projects 
there were also increases in our facilities costs of approximately million 
the increases are partially offset by decreases in our expense of approximately million related to personnel  temporary help and consulting 
the dollar decrease from to is due to trimble s receiving approximately million more funds from cost reimbursement projects in as compared to also  there were decreases in our expenses of approximately million related to electronics parts  depreciation  travel  personnel  and other supplies as part of the company s restructuring plans which were implemented in the last half of fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal  representing of revenues  as compared with in and in the primary reason for the dollar and percentage increase in expenses from to is the purchase of the spectra precision group in july  which had approximately million in sales and marketing expenses recorded in the period subsequent to trimble s acquisition 
the primary reason for the dollar and percentage decline in expenses from to is decreases of approximately million in personnel  consultants  travel  advertising  trade shows  expensed demo equipment  and other office supplies as part of the company s restructuring plan  which was implemented in the last half of fiscal in addition  sales commissions were lower as a percentage of sales  due to the change in dealer structure for some of our product lines from commission dealers to buy sell arrangements 
trimble s future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete  and on our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products 
in addition  we have encountered significant competition in selected markets  and we expect such competition to intensify as the market for gps applications receives acceptance 
several of trimble s competitors are major corporations with substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources 
increased competition may result in reduced market share and is likely to result in price reductions of gps based products  which could adversely affect trimble s revenues and profitability 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased during fiscal  representing of revenues  compared with in both and the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to an allowance for doubtful accounts charge in fiscal related to certain customers in south america which was not repeated in fiscal we also had decreases of approximately million in expenses related for personnel  legal  facilities  equipment and other office supplies 
the decreases were partially offset by approximately million of the spectra precision group s expenses included since its purchase in july the increase in absolute dollars from to is due to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain customers in south america for  and an increase in building rental costs due to the renewal of many of our building leases 
this increase was partially offset by space consolidations as part of our restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of restructuring reserves 
acquisition restructuring reserves 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements  as a result of the acquisition of the spectra precision group  the company accrued approximately million for costs to close certain duplicative office facilities and combine operations and relocate certain employees 
these costs were accrued as part of the preliminary allocation of the purchase price 
the facility consolidation and employee relocations will result from primarily combining certain office facilities and duplicative functions  including management functions  of the spectra precision group 
the company has not yet finalized its plans to consolidate facilities and to relocate employees  nor has it finalized a determination of the total costs to be incurred upon the termination of certain office facility leases or its ability to sublease vacated office space 
accordingly  unresolved issues could result in an increase or decrease in the liabilities for facility consolidation  the discontinuance of overlapping product lines  employee relocation  and related tax and legal expenses 
these adjustments  if any  will be reported as an increase or decrease in goodwill 
through december   the company had charged  which consisted of inventory write offs related to the discontinuance of overlapping product lines against the reserve  and the accrual for future costs to be incurred was million at december  the company anticipates on utilizing this reserve by the end of fiscal the elements of the reserve at fiscal year end on the balance sheet are as follows in thousands employee relocation expense inventory obsolescence  legal and tax expense  restructuring expenses  subtotal  restructuring charges 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements during the year ended january   the company recorded a restructuring charge of million classified as operating expenses 
these charges were a result of the company s reorganization to improve business processes and to decrease organizational redundancies  to improve management accountability and to improve the company s focus on profitable operations 
as a result of the reorganization  the company downsized its operations  including reducing headcount and facilities space usage  and canceled its enterprise wide information system project and certain research and development projects 
the impact of these decisions was that significant amounts of the company s fixed assets  prepaid expenses  and purchased technology were impaired and certain liabilities incurred 
the company wrote down the related assets to their net realizable values and made provisions for the estimated liabilities 
the elements of the charges in fiscal and the amounts remaining at december   on the balance sheet are as follows in thousands total charged to amounts paid amounts paid amounts paid remaining in expense in written off written off written off accrued liabilites fiscal in fiscal in fiscal in fiscal as of december  employee termination benefits    facility space reductions   erp system abandonment    subtotal     goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
amortization expense of goodwill and other intangibles increased for the year ended december  by approximately million related to the purchase of spectra precision group 
nonoperating income expense  net 
nonoperating income expense  net  includes interest income and expense  as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign exchange losses were  in fiscal  compared with gains of  in and gains of  in trimble s policy is to hedge its exposure to foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consolidated results of operations 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward contracts offset gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions 
interest income increased in from as well as in from the higher interest income in and is due primarily to the increased interest income received on cash and short term investments because of higher average balances 
interest expense increased in fiscal due to financing obtained for the acquisition of the spectra precision group 
interest expense includes interest on a million credit facility and an million subordinated sellers note both issued in july see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt 
income tax provision 
trimble s effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal years  and are  and  respectively 
the and income tax rates are less than the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to the realization of the benefits from prior net operating losses and previously reserved deferred tax assets 
the income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate  due primarily to foreign taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net operating losses 
inflation 
the effects of inflation on trimble s financial results have not been significant to date 
litigation trimble is involved in a number of legal matters as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while trimble does not expect to suffer significant adverse effects from these litigation matters or from unasserted claims  the nature of litigation is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that it will not do so 
liquidity and capital resources at december   trimble had cash and cash equivalents of million and had no short term investments 
trimble s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased from the prior year  due to the purchase of the spectra precision group in july trimble s long term debt consists of million outstanding under senior secured credit facilities  and a million subordinated promissory note 
in the past  trimble has relied primarily on cash provided by operating and financing activities and net sales of short term investments to fund capital expenditures  the repurchase of the company s common stock  and other investing activities 
management believes that its cash  and cash equivalents balances  together with its new credit facility  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
in fiscal  the cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to cash provided of million in the corresponding period in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal arose from the company s net income  plus depreciation and amortization and increase in accounts payable and offset partially by increases in inventories and increases in accounts receivable 
trimble s ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in a large part on revenues  the rate of collections of accounts receivable  and the successful management of the company s manufacturing relationship with solectron corporation 
cash provided by sales of common stock in fiscal year represents the proceeds from purchases made by employees pursuant to trimble s stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan and totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  effective as of july   trimble completed the acquisition of the spectra precision group for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the acquisition was financed with million in seller subordinated debt  million of debt provided through a syndicate of banks  and million of the company s then available cash on hand 
the company also expects to incur up to million of total costs and expenses in connection with the acquisition of which approximately million has already been incurred to date 
in order to finance the acquisition of the spectra precision group  fund the company s on going working capital requirements  and pay related fees and expenses of the acquisition  trimble i obtained a new senior secured credit facility  ii issued an million subordinated seller promissory note  iii terminated its existing million unsecured revolving credit facility and iv prepaid its existing million outstanding subordinated promissory notes 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements under acquisition financing 
in and  trimble approved a discretionary program whereby up to a total of million shares of its common stock could be repurchased on the open market by the company to offset the potential dilutive effects to earnings per share from the issuance of additional stock options 
during and  trimble purchased a total of million shares at a cost of million 
during fiscal and fiscal  no shares were repurchased under the discretionary program 
trimble s current credit facility limits the amount of its common stock it can repurchase 
the company is allowed to repurchase shares of its common stock only up to of net income in the previous fiscal year 
the company presently expects fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million  primarily for computer equipment  software  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
trimble has evaluated the issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency euro for initial implementation as of january   and during the transition period through january  trimble does not currently believe that the introduction of the euro will have a material effect on its foreign exchange and hedging activities 
trimble has also assessed the potential impact the euro conversion will have in regard to its internal systems accommodating euro denominated transactions 
trimble will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction over time  based on currently available information 
trimble does not currently anticipate any adverse impact of the euro conversion on the company 
certain other risk factors difficulties in integrating new acquisitions could adversely affect our business 
critical to the success of our growth is the effective and timely integration of acquired businesses into our organization 
if our integration efforts are unsuccessful  our businesses will suffer 
we have recently acquired the spectra precision group 
the acquisition presents unique product  marketing  research and development  facilities  information systems  accounting  personnel and other integration challenges 
this transition is still in its early stages and involves certain risks  including the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses  the inability to realize anticipated synergies or cost reductions or other value  diversion of management s attention  difficulties in scaling up production at new sites and coordinating management of operations at new sites  and loss of key employees of acquired operations 
also  our information systems and those of the companies we acquire are often incompatible  requiring substantial upgrades to one or the other 
further  our current senior combined management is a combination of the prior senior management teams of trimble and the spectra precision group several of whom have not previously worked with other members of management 
the benefits to us of the acquisition and our success  as a whole  depends upon our succeeding in each of these and other integration challenges 
nevertheless  the integration of our business with another may result in unanticipated operations problems  expenses and liabilities and the diversion of management attention our sales force is and will be in the future a combination of our sales force and the sales forces of the businesses we acquire  which must be effectively integrated for us to remain successful 
our acquisition of the spectra precision group has resulted in sales forces differing in products sold  marketing channels used and sales cycles and models applied 
accordingly  we may experience disruption in sales and marketing in connection with our efforts to integrate our various sales and marketing forces  and we may be unable to efficiently or effectively correct any such disruptions or achieve our sales and marketing objectives if we fail in these efforts 
furthermore  it may be difficult to retain key sales personnel 
as a result  we may fail to take full advantage of the combined sales forces efforts  and one company s sales approaches and distribution channels may be ineffective in promoting another entity s products  all of which may materially harm our business  financial condition or operating results 
risks associated with sole suppliers and limited sources 
with the selection of solectron corporation in august as an exclusive manufacturing partner for many of our gps products previously manufactured out of our sunnyvale facilities  trimble is substantially dependent upon a sole supplier for the manufacture of its products 
under the agreement with solectron  trimble provides to solectron a twelve month product forecast and places purchase orders with solectron sixty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to trimble customers 
although trimble purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable  the terms of the agreement would require trimble to purchase from solectron all material inventory not returnable or usable by other solectron customers 
accordingly  if trimble inaccurately forecasts demand for its products  trimble may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from solectron to meet customers delivery requirements or trimble may accumulate excess inventories 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of our critical asics 
we have experienced shortages of such supplies in the past 
our reliance on sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing 
the disruption or termination of any of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
fluctuations in annual and quarterly performance 
our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
results in any period could be affected by changes in market demand  competitive market conditions  market acceptance of new or existing products  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the cost and availability of components  our ability to manufacture and ship products  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization effectively  our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees and general economic conditions 
due to the foregoing factors  our operating results in one or more future periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations 
in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our revenues have historically tended to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of shipments of products under contracts and the sale of licensing rights 
a significant portion of trimble s quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of a quarter 
if orders are not received  or if shipments were to be delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  the operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 
future revenues are difficult to predict  and projections are based primarily on historical models  which are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
despite the fluctuations in its quarterly sales patterns  the company s operating expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis 
as a result  if expected sales are deferred for any reason  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
trimble s gross margin is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  product pricing  cost of components  foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs 
for example  since engineering construction and agriculture products generally have higher gross margins than component technologies products  absent other factors  a shift in sales toward engineering construction and agriculture products would lead to a gross margin improvement for trimble 
on the other hand  if market conditions in the highly competitive engineering construction and agriculture market segments forced us to lower unit prices  we would suffer a decline in gross margin unless we were able to timely offset the price reduction by a reduction in production costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins 
either of these events could have a material effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks of managing future growth 
any significant growth in our sales or any significant expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our management  financial  manufacturing and other resources and may require us to implement and improve a variety of operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls 
while trimble plans significant expansion of its sales  accounting  manufacturing  and other information systems to meet these challenges  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that any existing or new systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our systems  procedures and controls will be designed  implemented or improved in a cost effective and timely manner 
any failure to implement  improve and expand such systems  procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
competition 
trimble s markets are highly competitive 
our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price  quality and performance of our products  the level of customer service  the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets 
within each of our markets  we encounter direct competition from other gps  optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger domestic and international competitors and new market entrants  some of which may be current trimble customers 
the competition in the future  may  in some cases  result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement this strategy successfully  or that any such products will be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors  many of whom have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition through price reductions or loss of market share 
risks associated with international operations and sales 
our customers are located throughout the world 
in addition  we have significant offshore operations  including manufacturing facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations 
our offshore operations include facilities in australia  canada  china  france  germany  great britain  japan  mexico  new zealand  sweden  russia  singapore and others 
our international presence exposes us to risks not faced by wholly domestic companies 
specifically  we face the following risks  among others  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  particularly in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and research facilities  difficulties in staffing and management  language and cultural barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities in the summer months in europe and some other countries  integration of foreign operations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  currency fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although we implemented a program to manage foreign exchange risks through hedging and other strategies  there can be no assurance that this program will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain foreign markets  there may be reluctance to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
volatility of stock price 
our common stock has experienced and can be expected to experience substantial price volatility in response to actual or anticipated quarterly variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments related to patents or other intellectual property rights  developments in our relationship with customers  suppliers  or strategic partners and other events or factors 
in addition  any short fall or changes in revenue  gross margins  earnings  or other financial results from analysts expectations could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
additionally  certain macro economic factors such as changes in interest rates as well as market climate for the high technology sector could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock 
dependence on proprietary technology  risk of patent infringement claims 
trimble s future success and competitive position is dependent upon its proprietary technology  and we rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the patents owned or licensed by us will not be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by trimble  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by trimble 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by trimble to protect its technology will prevent the misappropriation of such technology 
the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
trimble recognizes that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign our products 
we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but we cannot be certain they do not do so 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
dependence on new products 
trimble s future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products  enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products 
however  there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or  if developed  will achieve significant customer acceptance 
if we were unable to successfully define  develop and introduce competitive new products  and enhance existing products  our future results of operations would be adversely affected 
development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products 
the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to the future success of trimble 
in some of our markets for example  engineering construction where we currently have a market leadership position  a delay in new product introductions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
no assurance can be given that we will not incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products 
in addition  some of our products are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold 
for example  ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european union 
an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
strategic alliances and external investments 
we are continuously evaluating alliances and external investments in technologies related to our business  and have entered into many strategic alliances including making relatively small strategic equity investments in a number of gps related technology companies 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products and alliances and strategic investments entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale  or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  iii loss of key employees of acquired operations  and iv inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we also believe that in certain emerging markets our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain strategic alliances with established system providers and industry leaders 
our failure to form and maintain such alliances  or the preemption of such alliances by actions of other competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets 
no assurances can be given that we will not incur problems from current or future alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
dependence on key customers 
we currently enjoy strong relationships with key customers 
an increasing amount of our revenue is generated from large oems such as philips vdo  nortel  caterpillar  cnh global formerly case corporation  bosch  and others 
a reduction or loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to realize value from these relationships in the future 
dependence on key markets and successful identification of new markets 
trimble s current products serve many applications in engineering construction  agriculture  fleet asset management  component technologies  and portfolio technologies market segments 
no assurances can be given that these market segments will continue to generate significant or consistent demand for our products 
existing market segments could be significantly diminished by new technologies or products that replace or render obsolete our technologies and products 
trimble is dependent on successfully identifying new markets for its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify new high growth markets in the future 
moreover  there can be no assurance that new markets will develop for trimble or its customers products  or that our technology or pricing will enable such markets to develop 
dependence on retaining and attracting highly skilled development and managerial personnel 
the ability of trimble to maintain its competitive technological position will depend  in a large part  on its ability to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified employees in our industry and location is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  motivate and retain enough qualified employees necessary for the future continued development of our business and products 
potential adverse impact of governmental and other similar certifications 
trimble has certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold 
for example  faa certification is required for all aviation products 
also  our products that use integrated radio communication technology require an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc for frequency band usage 
during the fourth quarter of  the fcc temporarily suspended the issuance of licenses for certain of our real time kinematic products because of interference with certain other users of similar radio frequencies 
an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or delays of the fcc could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
dependence on radio frequency spectrum 
trimble s gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government s global positioning system gps 
the gps sps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services 
international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu  a specialized technical agency of the united nations 
these allocations are further governed by radio regulations which have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two three years by the world radio communication conference 
any itu reallocation of radio frequency bands  including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum  may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  unwanted emissions from mobile satellite services and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband from licensed and unlicensed devices may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the federal communications commission fcc continually receives proposals for novel technologies and services which may seek to operate in  or across  the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps and other public safety services 
adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
reliance on gps satellite network 
navstar satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage 
the satellites were originally designed to have lives of years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate 
however  of the current deployment of satellites in place  some have already been in place for years and have an average age of years 
to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible 
if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable  there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites 
a reduction in the number of operating satellites would impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period  or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will remain unchanged 
however  a presidential decision directive marks the first time in the evolution of gps that access for civilian use free of direct user fees is specifically recognized and supported by presidential policy 
in addition  presidential policy has been complemented by corresponding legislation  signed into law 
because of ever increasing commercial applications of gps  other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of gps signals 
any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of the company s products to select gps based systems instead of products based on competing technologies 
any resulting change in market demand for gps products could have a material adverse effect on trimble s financial results 
for example  european governments have expressed interest in building an independent satellite navigation system  known as galileo 
depending on the as yet undetermined design and operation of this system  there may be interference to the delivery of the gps sps and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
reliance on a continuous power supply 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below certain critical levels  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply or solectron s power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our california facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities or solectron to manufacture product at its facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
sfas will require trimble to record all derivatives held on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
with respect to derivatives which are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
in june of the financial accounting standards board delayed the effective date of implementation for one year  therefore  sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  trimble will adopt sfas as of the beginning of its fiscal year the effect of adopting the sfas has been evaluated  and does not have a material adverse effect on trimble s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
sab was effective the first fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  and requires companies to report any changes in revenue recognition as cumulative change in accounting principle at the time of implementation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
in march  the sec issued sab a amendment revenue recognition in financial statements  which delayed implementation of sab until the company s first fiscal quarter of in june  the sec issued sab b second amendment revenue recognition in financial statements  which delayed the implementation of sab until the company s fourth fiscal quarter of sab was adopted by the company in the fourth fiscal quarter of and it did not have any material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following is a discussion of trimble s exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
trimble uses certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
trimble does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with polices approved by trimble s board of directors 
market interest rate risk short term investments owned by the company 
as of december   trimble had no short term investments 
as of december   trimble had short term investments of million 
these short term investments consisted of million of highly liquid investments  with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months and a million liquid investment with an original maturity at the date of purchase of months  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these investments were subject to interest rate risk and decreased in value if market interest rates increased 
a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates from levels at december   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an immaterial amount 
because trimble had the ability to hold these investments until maturity  we did not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
outstanding debt of the company 
the company is exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under the new senior secured credit facilities 
the company s new credit facilities are comprised of a year us dollar only revolver  a year multi currency revolver  and a year term loan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under acquisition financing 
the entire credit facility has interest payments based on a floating rate of libor plus basis points for the first months and thereafter tied to a formula based on the company s leverage ratio 
the us dollar and the multi currency revolvers run through july and have outstanding principle balances at december  of  and  respectively 
as of december  the company has borrowed from the multi currency revolver in us currency only 
the term loan runs through july and has an outstanding principle balance of  at december  the month libor effective rate at december  was 
a increase in month libor rates could result in approximately million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 
the company also has million of euro denominated debt 
at december  million was current 
the interest rate on the current portion of this instrument is fixed at 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company as related to this debt 
in addition  the company has a million promissory note  of which  was current at december  the note is payable in monthly installments  bearing an variable interest rate 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company 
as of december   trimble had outstanding long term debt of approximately million of subordinated promissory notes at a fixed interest rate of 
the interest rate of this instrument was fixed 
a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates would not have a material impact on trimble 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase interest expense associated with future borrowings of trimble  if any 
the company may consider utilizing interest rate swap agreements to alter interest rate exposures 
there were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  or december  foreign currency exchange rate risk trimble hedges risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
trimble utilizes forward contracts to hedge trade and intercompany receivables and payables 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements  as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the hedge contracts 
all hedge instruments are marked to market through earnings every period 
trimble does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year  and we do not defer any gains and losses  as they are all accounted for through earnings every period 
the following table provides information about the company s foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december  foreign contract value fair value buy currency amount usd in usd currency sell in thousands in thousands in thousands yen sell    nzd buy    nzd sell euro sell    sterling buy    the following table provides information about trimble s foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december  foreign contract value fair value buy currency amount usd in usd currency sell in thousands in thousands in thousands yen buy  yen sell    nzd buy    euro sell    sterling buy    the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by trimble s management  should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above
