item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview accrue software was founded in and is headquartered in fremont  california with regional sales offices throughout the us  and international offices in the united kingdom  canada  france  germany and singapore 
our products  accrue insight  accrue g  accrue hit list and our analytics platforms which include pilot  decision series  and infocharger are comprehensive solutions that enable business decision makers to address critical marketing and merchandising initiatives concerning the effectiveness of their web sites 
these initiatives encourage visitors to stay longer  buy more  and come back more often 
we offer our products to customers for a license fee and also provide related maintenance services 
in addition  we provide professional services to assist customers at every stage in their deployment of accrue products  from identification of their specific business needs through enterprise integration and customization of e business analysis reporting  to delivery of a rapid and effective implementation 
substantially all of our product revenues through march  were attributable to licensing accrue insight  accrue hit list  pilot and related products and support services 
we anticipate that sales of accrue g to new and existing customers will account for a significant portion of product and services revenue in fiscal year a decline in the price or demand of accrue g products  or related products and service would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
maintenance for accrue insight  accrue hit list and pilot will account for a significant portion of maintenance revenue for fiscal year in june  we sold certain of our software assets acquired as part of our acquisition of neovista to jda software group  inc  but have retained license rights to incorporate neovista software into accrue products for distribution in certain market segments 
we recognize license revenues upon customer acceptance of a product provided that a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of resulting receivables is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally do not allow product returns  however  in the past  upon request by a customer and approval of management  certain returns have been allowed 
therefore  provision for estimated product returns are recorded at the time the products are shipped 
for contracts with multiple obligations eg products  maintenance  installation and other services  revenue is allocated to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value  or for products not being sold separately  the price established by management 
we recognize revenue allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for product revenue set forth above are met 
we recognize revenue allocated to maintenance fees  including amounts allocated from product revenue  for ongoing customer support and product updates ratably over the period of the maintenance contract 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
for revenue allocated to consulting services  such as installation and training  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
we market our products  both domestically and internationally  through our direct sales force 
sales derived through indirect channels  which consist primarily of international resellers and system integrators  accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal year we expect that sales through indirect channels will increase as a percentage of total revenue as we expand our international efforts 
we license our products to our customers primarily on a perpetual basis 
our pricing model is based on the number of server based cpus allowing for additional revenue as a customer s e business expands 
license fees for our products have typically ranged from ten to several hundred thousand dollars 
annual support and maintenance contracts  which are purchased with initial product licenses  entitle customers to telephone support and upgrades  when and if available 
the price for our support and maintenance program is based on a percentage of list price and is paid in advance 
consulting fees for implementation services and training are primarily charged on a time and materials basis 
our new product  accrue g  is available starting in may through our preferred customer program 
accrue g is a comprehensive e business analytic platform designed to provide companies with deep insight into the relationships between web site activity and business actions 
some of the key benefits include rapid return on investment through immediate response to online customer behavior  higher lifetime customer value through ongoing relationship management  sustainable depth of analysis and system responsiveness through growth of web site volume and complexity  and configurable integration of accrue g into existing production information systems 
we have recorded stock based compensation related to stock options granted below fair market value through march  and march  of approximately million and million  respectively 
of this amount  we amortized approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year this amount represents the difference between the exercise price of these stock option grants and the deemed fair value of the common stock at the time of grant 
the remaining balance of stock based compensation will be amortized over the remaining vesting period of the related options 
as a result  the amortization of stock based compensation will impact our reported results of operations through fiscal we have sustained losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception 
at march   we have an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our net loss was approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year these losses resulted from significant costs incurred in the development and sale of our products and services and  particularly in fiscal year  merger related costs and non cash charges for the impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of neovista software  inc  pilot software  inc 
and infocharger  a division of tantau software international  inc we anticipate that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
if we do achieve profitability  we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future  or at all 
you should not rely upon our past operating results as an indication of future performance 
while we have experienced significant percentage growth in revenues in recent periods  we have a limited operating history and we do not believe that prior growth rates are sustainable or indicative of future growth rates 
results of operations the following tables set forth our historical operating information  as well as the information as a percentage of our total revenue represented by each item  for the periods indicated years ended march  in thousands  except as a percentage of total revenue statement of operations data net revenue software license    maintenance and service    total revenue    cost of revenue   gross profit    operating expenses research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    merger costs  in process research and development  amortization of intangibles   goodwill impairment charge  stock based compensation expense    total operating expenses    loss from operations    other income expense  net   net loss    as a percentage of total revenue net revenue software license maintenance and service total revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative merger costs in process research and development amortization of intangibles goodwill impairment charge stock based compensation expense total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net net loss fiscal years ended march   and revenue 
total revenue increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year these increases reflect year on year revenue growth of and  respectively 
no customer accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal year  or software license revenue 
revenue from software licenses was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year representing increases of million  or from fiscal year to fiscal year and a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year the majority of the growth in product revenue for fiscal year was due to higher unit sales volumes of accrue insight and accrue hit list as a result of increased market awareness of our products  introductions of new features  increases in both the size and productivity of our sales force  and increased average dollar size of licenses 
the decrease in product revenue for fiscal year is primarily due to lower than anticipated sales of our products as a result of a decline in purchases from e commerce companies and an increase in our product sales cycle to enterprise customers 
the license revenue for fiscal year also decreased as a result of sales during the year involving a greater percentage of professional services causing us to defer the license revenue relating to these contracts which we will recognize over the period the services are rendered 
we anticipate that revenue from product licenses will represent a smaller percentage of our revenues in fiscal we expect that the growth rate of our revenue base will also decrease in the future and therefore the historical percentage growth rates of our product revenue will not be sustainable in the future 
maintenance and service revenue 
maintenance and service revenue was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year representing increases of from fiscal year to fiscal year  and from fiscal year to fiscal year this growth was primarily due to expanded service offerings and the inclusion of maintenance revenues related to our acquisition of pilot software  inc we expect that our historical percentage growth rates of our maintenance and service revenue will not be sustainable in the future 
maintenance and service revenues depend on the continued ability of our customers to pay over time 
if the creditworthiness of our customers deteriorates  particularly customers that are dependent on revenues from e commerce  we may not be able to sustain our historic levels of maintenance and service revenues in the future 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the salaries and related expenses for maintenance and service personnel 
these costs were million or of revenue in fiscal year  million or of revenue in fiscal year  and million or of revenue in fiscal year representing increases of from fiscal year to fiscal year  and from fiscal year to fiscal year the dollar increases in the cost of revenue reflect primarily a substantial increase in maintenance and service personnel headcount 
because all development costs incurred in the research and development of our software products and enhancements to our existing software products have been expensed as incurred  cost of revenue includes no amortization of capitalized software development costs 
we do not anticipate continued increases to our headcount and related costs in the next several quarters but may rely more on outsourcing alternatives in the near term 
gross profit 
gross profit was in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year in the future  we expect that sales derived through indirect channels will increase as a percentage of total revenue 
we also expect that maintenance and service revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue 
maintenance and service revenue has lower gross profit than product revenue  as does the revenue derived through indirect channels 
for all of these reasons  we expect that our gross profit will continue to decline 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increases reflect year to year growth of and respectively 
the significant increase from fiscal year to fiscal year was largely due to increased salaries  related expenses associated with newly hired employees  merger related costs  and amortization of intangibles 
the significant increase from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to an increased amortization expense related to the acquisitions in fiscal year and a goodwill impairment charge 
unless we undertake additional acquisitions in fiscal year  we do not anticipate incurring the same level of increases in our operating expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  and the performance of quality assurance and documentation activities 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increases were primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated support for software engineers required to expand and enhance our product and services offerings 
the significant increase from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to the expanded research and development group as a result of the fiscal year acquisitions and costs associated with the development of our new product  accrue g however  we believe that research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses of sales and marketing personnel  and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increases were primarily due to increased headcount  commission expense  and marketing expenditures in our sales and marketing departments 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount but decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs for executive  financial  human resource  information services  and other administrative functions  as well as legal and accounting costs 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year these increases were primarily the result of increased staffing and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our growth 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal year include bad debt expenses of million 
the increase in bad debt expenses was due primarily to provision recorded on past due accounts receivable for several e commerce internet customers 
these customers have experienced a significant decline in their ability to obtain additional resources to fund their business models 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
merger costs 
during september  we completed the acquisition of marketwave corporation through the issuance of accrue common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the pooling of interest method 
we incurred merger related costs of million in fiscal year these nonrecurring expenses related to transaction costs  employee termination costs  legal and accounting costs  write off of equipment and other assets  and redundant facility and other costs 
in process research and development 
in connection with our corporate acquisitions  in process research and development represents the associated costs of research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses at the date of the relevant acquisition 
the value of the purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the products  including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were then discounted back to their net present value 
the projected net cash flows from the projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects 
we recorded a one time charge of million in fiscal year for in process research and development associated with our acquisition of neovista software  inc we recorded a one time charge of million in fiscal year for in process research and development associated with our acquisitions of the infocharger division of tantau software international  inc and pilot software  inc 
regarding our purchases  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition as they relate to the value of purchased in process research and development 
the assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market 
there have been no product shipments to date from acquired technologies related to the in process research and development  therefore  it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections early in the technology or product lifecycle 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products may negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was completed 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles were million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the balance is associated with the amortization of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of neovista software  inc  the infocharger division of tantau software international  inc  and pilot software  inc goodwill and intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over a useful life of three years 
goodwill impairment charge 
during fiscal year  we performed impairment assessments of the identifiable intangibles and enterprise level goodwill recorded upon the acquisition for stock of neovista  infocharger and pilot  which we completed on january  july and august   respectively 
our assessments were performed primarily as a result of the decline in our revenues in the second half of the fiscal year  the anticipated decline in our projected operating results due to the overall decline in the e commerce industry and the significant decline in our stock price since the date the shares issued in each acquisition were valued 
goodwill exceeded our market capitalization prior to the impairment charge 
as a result of our review  we recorded a charge of million in fiscal year to reduce our enterprise level goodwill 
the charge was determined based upon our estimated discounted cash flows using a discount rate of 
the assumptions supporting our cash flows including the discount rate were determined using our best estimates 
the remaining identifiable intangibles balance of approximately million will be amortized over the remaining useful life of approximately months  which we consider appropriate 
stock based compensation 
total stock based compensation amounted to million  million and million  of which approximately million  million and million was amortized in fiscal years  and  respectively 
million was adjusted for canceled options relating to employees terminated in fiscal year the remaining balance of stock based compensation of million will continue to be amortized over the remaining vesting period of the related options 
such deferred expense has been recorded as a reduction of equity in the balance sheet 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists of interest income and interest expense 
other income expense  net was less than million in fiscal year and approximately million in each of the fiscal years and at march  we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  for tax purposes 
in addition  at march   we had million and million of federal and state tax credit carryforwards  respectively 
these operating loss carryforwards and credits have begun to expire in under the provisions of the internal revenue code  certain substantial changes in our ownership occurring in the past or future may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that we could utilize annually to offset future taxable income 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and other operating expenses based  in large part  on our expected future revenue 
our expectations regarding future revenue may not be accurate 
as a result  if revenue falls below expectations  our operating results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenue 
due to these factors  our operating results are difficult to forecast 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations principally through private sales of preferred stock with net proceeds of million  our initial public offering with net proceeds of million  bank loans and cash generated from operations 
we used cash primarily to fund our net losses from operations and to pay for acquisition related expenses 
cash used in operating activities totaled million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  cash used for operating activities was primarily attributable to a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million offset in part by an increase in deferred revenue of million  increase in accrued liabilities of million and non cash charges totaling million 
the increase in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were a result of higher unit sales of accrue insight while the non cash charges primarily comprised a stock based compensation charge of million 
in fiscal year  cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accrued costs related to mergers and acquisitions of million offset in part by an increase in deferred revenue of million and non cash charges totaling million 
the increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were a result of higher revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the non cash charges were primarily made up of an amortization charge of million of intangibles arising from acquisitions during fiscal and a stock based compensation charge of million 
in fiscal year  cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  a decrease in accrued costs related to mergers and acquisitions of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and non cash charges aggregating million 
the decreases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were a result of the decrease in license revenue and a smaller growth rate of maintenance and service revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the non cash charges were primarily made up of depreciation and amortization of intangibles of million  goodwill impairment charge of million  write off of purchased in process research and development of million  provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts of million and a stock based compensation charge of million 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increases in fiscal year and fiscal year resulted primarily from the purchase of property and equipment 
the increase from fiscal year to fiscal year was attributable to the cash of million paid for our acquisition of the infocharger division of tantau software international  inc in addition to the purchase of property and equipment of million 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  and cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal year the activity includes proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and notes payable 
the activity includes net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering 
the activity includes repayment of a line of credit and equipment loan of million  increase in restricted cash of million and repurchase of common stock of million  offset by proceeds from short term borrowings of million  proceeds from employee stock purchase plan and stock options and warrants exercised of million 
we had million  million and million in working capital at march   and  respectively 
we have a million working capital line with silicon valley bank expiring in june interest is payable monthly 
we expect to experience a short term decrease in cash resources as a result of our reduction in projected revenue and resulting cash collections 
we anticipate that our operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  funds generated from operations  payment from sale of technology assets in june and available commercial credit and other facilities from the bank will provide adequate liquidity to meet our normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms  if at all 
year readiness year issues refer generally to the problems that some software may have in determining the correct century for the year 
for example  software with date sensitive functions that is not year compliant may not be able to distinguish whether means or  which may result in failures or the creation of erroneous results 
we have defined year compliance as the ability to correctly handle date information needed for the december  to january  date change  function according to the product documentation provided for this date change  without changes in operation resulting from the advent of a new century  assuming correct configuration  respond to two digit date input in a way that resolves the ambiguity as to century in a disclosed  defined and predetermined manner  store and provide output of date information in ways that are unambiguous as to century if the date elements in interfaces and data storage specify the century  and recognize the year as a leap year 
we designed our current products to be year compliant when configured and used in accordance with the related documentation  and provided that the underlying operating system of the host machine and any other software used with or in the host machine or our products are year compliant 
we have tested our products for year compliance 
at may   we have not experienced any significant issues as a result of year problems and do not anticipate incurring material incremental costs in future periods due to such issues 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
we will adopt sfas no 
 as amended  effective april  but do not expect that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
to date  we have not engaged in derivative or hedging activities 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the commission 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
the implementation of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying accounting practice board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation was effective july   and did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and credit facilities 
all investments are classified as cash equivalents and are deposited with financial institutions carried at cost  which approximate market value 
we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at march   march  and march   the decline in fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we plan to mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities 
foreign currency risk although we have foreign sales offices in europe and asia  to date  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations has not been significant 
international sales are transacted in us dollars and operating expenses of foreign offices are funded from time to time in us dollars 
however  as we continue to increase our international business we could be subject to risks typical of an international business  including but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
to date  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge any foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
