item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section of our annual report on form k also contains forward looking statements  which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to our future plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
these statements may be identified by the use of words such as may  will  should  potential  expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes and similar expressions 
these statements are based on our current beliefs  expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements 
see risk factors for a discussion of certain risks  including those relating to our operating losses  our early stage of development and our products  strategic collaborations  risks related to our industry and forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general since our inception  we have been principally engaged in the research and development of drugs and medical device products for use in photopoint tm  our proprietary technologies for photodynamic therapy 
we have been unprofitable since our founding and have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million as of december  we expect to continue to incur substantial  and possibly increasing  operating losses for the next few years due to continued and increased spending on research and development programs  the funding of preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory activities and the costs of manufacturing and administrative activities 
our historical revenues primarily reflect income earned from licensing agreements  grants awarded  royalties from device product sales  milestone payments  payments for our devices and interest income 
to date  we have received no revenue from the sale of drug products and we are not permitted to engage in commercial sales of drugs or devices until such time  if ever  as we receive requisite regulatory approvals 
as a result  we do not expect to record significant commercial product sales or royalties related to such product sales until such approvals are received 
until we commercialize our product s  we expect revenues to continue to be attributed to licensing agreements 
additional revenues may also be provided in the near future from sales of drug components to pharmacia corporation 
these drug components are manufactured by miravant and are used to manufacture our drug snet  which is currently being used in the wet age related macular degeneration or amd preclinical studies and phase iii clinical trials 
we anticipate that future revenues and results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly depending on  among other factors  the timing and outcome of applications for regulatory approvals  our or our collaborative partners ability to successfully manufacture  market and distribute our drug and device products  the level of participation of our collaborative partners in our preclinical studies and clinical trials and or the restructuring or establishment of collaborative arrangements for the development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of some of our products 
we anticipate our operating activities will result in substantial  and possibly increasing  operating losses for the next few years 
pharmacia corporation  with our assistance  is currently conducting the phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of amd 
these trials were fully enrolled in december  and these patients are now in the two year follow up period for safety and efficacy evaluation 
pharmacia corporation  which has assumed control of the clinical and regulatory aspects of snet in ophthalmology and the related phase iii amd clinical trials  has elected to continue the clinical trials through to the conclusion of the two year follow up period  which is december subsequently  a full analysis of the safety and efficacy data will be performed and a determination of the status of the snet amd program will be made 
we are also conducting preclinical studies of new photoselective drugs for cardiovascular diseases  in particular for the prevention and treatment of restenosis 
restenosis is the renarrowing of an artery that commonly occurs after balloon angioplasty for obstructive coronary artery disease 
in our dermatology program  we have developed a topical formulation to deliver a new photoselective drug through the skin and continue to conduct preclinical studies with the expectation of pursuing certain clinical applications in the future 
in oncology  we are conducting preclinical research of our photoselective therapy to destroy abnormal blood vessels in tumors 
we are pursuing this tumor research with some of our new photoselective drugs and also investigating combination therapies with photopoint therapy and other types of compounds 
based upon the outcome of these studies and various economic and development factors  including cost  reimbursement and the available alternative therapies  we may or may not elect to further develop photopoint therapy procedures in ophthalmology  cardiovascular disease  dermatology  oncology or in any other indications 
under the amendments of the license agreements with pharmacia corporation  we were to conduct all preclinical studies and us clinical trials in amd and would be reimbursed by pharmacia corporation for most of the out of pocket expenses incurred 
pharmacia corporation was to conduct all international clinical trials for amd 
the amendments also returned to us the rights for snet in dermatology  and provided for the quarterly funding of million for eight quarters for use in our oncology and urology programs 
in january  we entered into an equity investment agreement  whereby pharmacia corporation purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share 
also  in february  under a separate credit agreement  pharmacia corporation extended to us up to million in credit  which was subject to certain limitations and requirements  including interest at a variable rate  in the form of up to six quarterly loans or new loans of million each to be used to support our ophthalmology  oncology and other development programs  as well as for general corporate purposes 
as of december   we have received the entire million available under the credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement and in connection with each draw down  we were obligated to issue pharmacia corporation a certain number of warrants based on the amount borrowed 
the exercise price of each warrant is equal to of the average of the closing bid prices of the common stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding the borrowing request for the related loan 
in connection with the quarterly loans received  we have issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per warrant share for  shares  per warrant share for  shares and per warrant share for the last  shares 
additionally  in connection with the equity investment agreement and the credit agreement  in february we amended the amendments of the license agreements with pharmacia corporation to eliminate the remaining future cost reimbursements for oncology and urology and any future milestone payments in amd 
the amendments are referred to in this report as the amendments 
in february  in connection with the amendments  we refined the use of our resources to correspond with the change in cost reimbursement and assistance from pharmacia corporation while maintaining our core development programs 
we will continue to evaluate the use of our resources in connection with our operating cash balances  funding availability  external resource assistance and as opportunities present themselves 
in december  we transitioned the majority of the operations of the phase iii amd clinical trials  as well as the drug manufacturing scale up responsibility  to pharmacia corporation in accordance with the amendments 
pharmacia corporation is now responsible for directly funding the majority of the phase iii amd clinical trials and drug manufacturing scale up costs 
we will continue to be responsible for some of the drug and device development and manufacturing necessary and the majority of the preclinical studies required for the new drug application or nda submission for amd and will be reimbursed for most of those costs in accordance with the amendments 
results of operations the following table provides a summary of our revenues for the years ended december   and consolidated revenues license contract research and development    royalties   grants    total revenues    revenues our revenues increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the fluctuations in revenues are due to the following license income 
license income  which represents reimbursements of out of pocket or direct costs incurred in preclinical studies and phase iii amd clinical trials in and  decreased from million in to million in the decrease in revenues is specifically related to the transition of the majority of the operations of the phase iii amd clinical trials to pharmacia corporation in december during  we were responsible for the oversight of the amd related preclinical studies  as well as a portion of the equipment and drug costs related to the phase iii amd clinical trials 
we were completely reimbursed for all out of pocket preclinical study costs and approximately half of the equipment and drug costs 
in  in addition to being responsible for the same types of costs incurred in  we were also responsible  and subsequently reimbursed  for the out of pocket costs associated with the screening  treatment and monitoring of individuals participating in the phase iii amd clinical trials 
reimbursements received in and were recorded in accordance with the amendments 
license income in represented a combination of reimbursements received for costs incurred in the amd clinical trials and payments received from pharmacia corporation for our oncology programs 
we recorded million in revenue for the specific reimbursement of out of pocket or direct costs incurred in the phase i  ii and iii preclinical and clinical trial costs in amd 
we also recorded million in revenue for payments received from pharmacia corporation to cover both the direct and indirect costs of our oncology programs 
grant income 
we have recorded grant income of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
grant income is due to a two year grant awarded in that was extended to the end of the fluctuations in grant revenue are due to the timing of work performed under the grant guidelines and the term of the grant 
while we will continue to pursue obtaining grants as a means of funding research and development programs  we have not yet received any additional grants and currently do not have any grant funds available to us 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any future grants 
royalty income 
we earned royalty income from a license agreement with laserscope  which provided royalties on the sale of our previously designed device products 
we recorded income of  and  in and  respectively 
we did not record any royalty income under this agreement in  or plan to in the future  as the license agreement terminated in april in accordance with the amendments  we will only be reimbursed for the specific costs for preclinical studies and clinical trials in ophthalmology and we will no longer be reimbursed for any oncology and urology program costs or any milestone payments for amd 
additionally  as a result of the transition of the majority of the operations of the phase iii amd clinical trials and funding responsibility to pharmacia corporation and the completion of the majority of the preclinical studies required for amd  we anticipate our license income related to the reimbursement of out of pocket or direct costs incurred will decrease in  as will our expenses related to the phase iii amd clinical trials 
in connection with the equity investment agreement and the credit agreement  in february we entered into the amendments to the license agreements which included the elimination of the remaining future cost reimbursements for oncology and urology and any future milestone payments in amd 
research and development our research and development expenses of million in decreased from the million recorded in and million recorded in the overall decrease in research and development expenses for compared to is related primarily to the december transition of the majority of the operations and funding responsibility of the phase iii amd clinical trials to pharmacia corporation 
our research and development expenses  net of license reimbursement and grant revenue  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
aside from the expenses incurred in the phase iii amd clinical trials  research and development expenses in and were consistent and in both years were comprised of preclinical studies related to our programs in oncology  dermatology and cardiology  and the development work associated with the development of existing and new drug compounds  formulations and clinical programs 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   we incurred substantial increases in our preclinical studies and clinical trial costs related to the phase iii program in amd 
these increases in were offset by decreases in salary expense  consultant costs  drug formulation costs for snet and laser purchases 
future research and development expenses may fluctuate depending on available funds  continued expenses incurred in our preclinical studies and clinical trials in our ophthalmology  dermatology  cardiovascular and other programs  costs associated with the purchase of raw materials and supplies for the production of devices and drug for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials  the pharmaceutical manufacturing requirements and expansion of our research and development programs  which includes the increased hiring of personnel  the continued expansion of existing or the commencement of new preclinical studies and clinical trials and the development of new drug compounds and formulations 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in the overall decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from compared to is primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense associated with options and warrants issued to consultants and a decrease in rent expense as a result of subleasing one of our buildings in december the decrease from compared to is due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with professional services received from financial consultants  attorneys and public and media relations and a decrease in compensation expense associated with options and warrants issued to consultants and expense recorded for the executive option loans 
future selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to remain consistent with prior years and may fluctuate depending on available funds  and the support required for research and development activities  continuing corporate development and professional services  compensation expense associated with stock options and warrants granted to consultants and expenses for general corporate matters 
loss in investment in affiliate in connection with the million line of credit we have provided to our affiliate  ramus medical technologies or ramus  we have recorded a reserve for the entire million outstanding credit line balance plus accrued interest of  as of december  the  expense recorded in represents a reserve for the final amount of borrowings under the credit line plus accrued interest 
the million expense recorded in consists primarily of a million reserve for funds provided to ramus in under the revolving credit agreement  as well as a reduction  based on of ramus losses for the respective period  of  related to our remaining equity investment made in ramus in the investment in ramus has been fully reserved for as of december  and  respectively 
interest and other income interest and other income increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in the fluctuations in interest income are directly related to the levels of cash and marketable securities earning interest 
the level of future interest income will primarily be subject to the level of cash balances we maintain from period to period and the interest rates earned 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in from  in and  in the increase from to is directly related to the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement with pharmacia corporation and the value of the warrants issued in connection with the borrowings 
interest expense related to warrants issued in connection with the borrowings amounted to  interest expense may fluctuate in the future based on the interest rate related to the borrowings and the balance of such borrowings 
non cash loss in investment during  we determined the decline in the value of our investment in xillix was other than temporary 
we recognized a loss totaling million to adjust our investment in xillix to its estimated current fair value based on the average closing prices over a day period 
this loss is included in non cash loss in investment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows 
as of december   we still hold the  shares of xillix common stock received in our original investment transaction 
the new cost basis in the investment is  and this investment will continue to be classified as an available for sale investment recorded at fair value with any resulting unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of stockholders equity 
income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of million which expire in the years to research credit carryforwards aggregating million are available for federal and state tax purposes and expire in the years to we also had a state net operating loss carryforward of million  which expires in the years to of the million in state net operating loss carryforwards  million will expire during and under section of the internal revenue code  utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited based on our changes in the percentage of ownership 
our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards  without limitation  is uncertain 
we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
deferred the effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception through december   we have accumulated a deficit of approximately million and expect to continue to incur substantial  and possibly increasing  operating losses for the next few years 
we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common stock and preferred stock  private placements of convertible notes and short term notes  our initial public offering  a secondary public offering  pharmacia corporation s purchases of common stock and credit arrangements 
as of december   we have received proceeds from the sale of equity securities  convertible notes and credit arrangements of approximately million 
we do not anticipate achieving profitability and or positive cash flow from operations in the next few years  and as such  we expect to continue to rely on external sources of financing to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
in september and october  we entered into a private placement offering  which was subsequently amended with respect to certain purchasers  which provided net proceeds to us of approximately million 
during  we issued an additional  shares of common stock  repurchased  shares of common stock for million and paid million  under the price protection and repurchase provisions of these agreements 
during the first quarter of  we completed our price protection obligations through the payment of million  the issuance of  shares of common stock and the issuance of  warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as such  we have no further obligation to these purchasers under the price protection or repurchase provisions of the securities purchase agreements and the amendments to those agreements 
in december  the board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
this  share repurchase authorization was in addition to and superseded the repurchase program authorized in july  which allowed for the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
we had no stock repurchases in or during  we repurchased stock under the board authorized repurchase program which amounted to  shares at a cost of million 
all shares repurchased were retired 
the  repurchase plan has been fully utilized and no further repurchase programs have been authorized 
in january  under the equity investment agreement  pharmacia corporation purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in february  in accordance with the credit agreement  pharmacia corporation also extended to us up to million in credit to be used to support our ophthalmology  oncology and other development programs  as well as for general corporate purposes 
before january  we were able to issue promissory notes for the amounts borrowed and for the quarterly interest payments due 
beginning in  we will be able to issue promissory notes for the quarterly interest due for any quarter in which our adjusted net earnings  as described by the credit agreement  is less than the quarterly interest due 
the ability to issue promissory notes may also be restricted by certain sales of our equity securities 
the promissory notes for both principal and interest mature in june and  at our option  can be repaid in the form of our common stock  subject to certain limitations and restrictions as defined by the credit agreement 
the promissory notes accrue interest at the prime rate  which was at december  as of december   in accordance with the credit agreement  we have received all six quarterly loans for a total of million available under the credit agreement 
in accordance with the credit agreement  we have issued promissory notes to pharmacia corporation for the loan amounts received and issued additional promissory notes for a total of million for the related interest due on each of the quarterly due dates through december  in connection with the quarterly loans received  we have issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per warrant share for  shares  per warrant share for  shares and per warrant share for  shares 
the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock are callable by us if the average closing prices of the common stock for trading days  preceding such request  exceeds the related warrant exercise price 
in june  we purchased an equity interest in xillix 
we received  shares of xillix common stock in exchange for million in cash and  shares of miravant common stock 
as of june  the shares received are no longer restricted and can be sold at anytime by the us  subject to certain limitations and restrictions contained in the credit agreement with pharmacia corporation 
in addition  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with xillix to co develop proprietary systems incorporating the technology of each company and to share the research and development costs 
to date  we have not incurred any costs under this agreement 
while we still hold all  shares of our original investment in xillix  in we determined the decline in the value of our investment in xillix was other than temporary 
we recognized a loss totaling million to adjust our investment in xillix to its estimated current fair value based on the average closing prices over a day period 
this loss is included in non cash loss in investment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows 
the new cost basis in the investment is  and this investment will continue to be classified as an available for sale investment recorded at fair value with any resulting unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of stockholders equity 
in april  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with our affiliate  ramus 
as of december   we have provided the entire loan of million to ramus 
the revolving credit line  which was due in full in march  has been subsequently extended to a period in the future  for which the terms of the extension are currently being negotiated 
in addition  in accordance with the equity investment in ramus  we had an exclusive option to purchase the remaining shares of ramus for a specified amount under certain terms and conditions 
we elected not to exercise the option  which expired march in addition to receiving funds through private and public stock offerings  we have also received funding through the exercise of warrants and stock options 
for the year ended december   we have received million in proceeds from warrant and option exercises 
based on the exercise prices  expiration dates and call features contained in certain warrants  and depending on the market value of our common stock  we may receive additional funding through the exercise of these outstanding warrants and stock options in the future 
for  and  we required cash for operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the timing of funds received from pharmacia corporation for reimbursable research and development costs and an increase in non cash interest and amortization of deferred financing costs related to the credit agreement 
these activities were offset by reductions in depreciation  amortization  deferred compensation expense and accounts payable 
the decrease in cash required for operations from to was due to a decrease in net research and development costs incurred in addition to a decrease in non cash charges for deferred compensation  stock awards and the reserve taken on the remaining ramus line of credit and the timing of the funds received from pharmacia corporation for reimbursable research and development costs 
for and  net cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
for  net cash provided by investing activities was million 
the net cash used in and for investing activities was directly related to the purchases of net marketable securities based on an analysis of the funds available for investment 
the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily due to the net sales of investments  which were used to fund operations and were based on the levels of cash available for investment 
these fluctuations were further affected by our investment in xillix  the line of credit provided to ramus and significant capital expenditures  which were primarily related to laboratory construction costs 
for and  net cash provided by financing activities was million and million  respectively 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million 
cash provided by financing activities in was attributed to the million provided under the credit agreement with pharmacia corporation and warrant and option exercise proceeds of million 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributed to pharmacia corporation s million equity investment and million provided under the pharmacia corporation credit agreement 
the significant use of cash for financing activities in was related to purchases of our common stock under the board authorized repurchase program as well as purchases of our common stock and the payment of cash under the price protection provisions of the amended securities purchase agreement 
we invested a total of million in property and equipment from through december  during  we entered into a new lease agreement for an additional facility  which we subleased in december based on available funds  we may continue to purchase property and equipment in the future as we expand our preclinical  clinical and research and development activities as well as the buildout and expansion of laboratories and office space 
our future capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including the progress and magnitude of our research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost involved in filing and maintaining patent claims  competitor and market conditions  investment opportunities  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  the level of pharmacia corporation s involvement in our phase iii amd clinical trials  the cost of manufacturing  manufacturing scale up and the cost and effectiveness of commercialization activities and arrangements  the extent and nature of costs reimbursed by current and future collaborations  and our ability to obtain grants to finance research and development projects 
we anticipate that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations through december  we have also entered into a non binding letter of intent with pharmacia corporation for additional funding of up to million 
our ability to generate substantial additional funding to continue our research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing  and administrative activities and to pursue any additional investment opportunities is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and will depend on numerous factors including our ability to successfully negotiate and complete our funding agreement with pharmacia corporation  our ability to raise funds in the future through public or private financings  collaborative arrangements or from other sources  our requirement to allocate of the net proceeds from public or private financings towards the repayment of the funds received under the credit agreement  the potential for equity investments  collaborative arrangements  license agreements or development or other funding programs with us in exchange for manufacturing  marketing  distribution or other rights to products developed by us  the amount of funds received from outstanding warrant and stock option exercises  our ability to maintain our existing collaborative arrangements  our ability to liquidate our equity investments in ramus  xillix or other assets  our requirement to allocate of the net proceeds from the liquidation of an existing asset towards the repayment of the funds received under the credit agreement  and our ability to collect the loan and accrued interest provided to ramus under their credit agreement with us 
we cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available to us when needed  if at all 
if additional funding is not available  we may be required to scale back our research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical trials and administrative activities and our business and financial results and condition would be materially adversely affected 
risk factors factors affecting future operating results you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
our business operations may be impaired by additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know of or that we currently consider immaterial 
our business  results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected if any of the following risks actually occur 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
this report also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks described below and elsewhere in this report 
risks related to our business all of our products  except snet  are in an early stage of development and all of our products  including snet  may never be successfully commercialized 
our products are at an early stage of development and our ability to successfully commercialize these products is dependent upon successfully completing our research or product development efforts or those of our collaborative partners  successfully transforming our drugs or devices currently under development into marketable products  obtaining the required regulatory approvals  manufacturing our products at an acceptable cost and with appropriate quality  favorable acceptance of any products marketed  and successful marketing and sales efforts of our corporate partner s 
we may not be successful in achieving any of the above  and if we are not successful  our business  financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected 
the time frame necessary to achieve these goals for any individual product is long and uncertain 
most of our products currently under development will require significant additional research and development and preclinical studies and clinical trials  and all will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of these and other problems  expenses  difficulties  complications and delays 
our products  in particular snet  may not successfully complete the clinical trials process and we may be unable to prove that our products are safe and efficacious 
all of our drug and device products currently under development will require extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials prior to regulatory approval for commercial use  which is a lengthy and expensive process 
none of our products have completed testing for efficacy or safety in humans 
some of the risks and uncertainties related to safety and efficacy testing and the completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials include our ability to demonstrate to the fda that snet or any other of our products is safe and efficacious  our ability to successfully complete the testing for any of our compounds within any specified time period  if at all  clinical data reported may change as a result of the continuing evaluation of patients  data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to varying interpretations which can delay  limit or prevent approval by the fda or other regulatory authorities  problems in research and development  preclinical studies or clinical trials that will cause us to delay  suspend or cancel clinical trials  and as a result of changing economic considerations  competitive or new technological developments  market approvals or changes  clinical or regulatory conditions  or clinical trial results  our focus may shift to other indications  or we may determine not to further pursue one or more of the indications currently being pursued 
to date  we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials 
we are relying on pharmacia corporation and contract research organizations for our amd clinical trials 
we will either need to rely on third parties  including our collaborative partners to design and conduct any required clinical trials or expend resources to hire additional personnel or engage outside consultants or contract research organizations to administer current and future clinical trials 
we may not be able to find appropriate third parties to design and conduct clinical trials or we may not have the resources to administer clinical trials in house 
our ability to complete clinical trials is dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors including the nature of our clinical trial protocols  existence of competing protocols or treatments  size and longevity of the target patient population  proximity of patients to clinical sites  and eligibility criteria for the trials 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain adequate levels of patient enrollment in current or future clinical trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs  delays or termination of clinical trials  which could have material adverse effects 
in addition  the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if  among other reasons  it concludes that patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
there is an approved treatment for amd and our patients enrolled in our phase iii amd clinical trials may choose to drop out of the trial or pursue alternative treatments 
this could result in delays or incomplete clinical trial data 
data already obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products under development do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from future preclinical studies and clinical trials 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies like us  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the potential product and would materially harm our business 
our clinical trials may not demonstrate the sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approval or may not result in marketable products 
our products may exhibit adverse side effects that prevent their widespread adoption or that necessitate withdrawal from the market 
our photopoint therapy drug and device products may exhibit undesirable and unintended side effects that may prevent or limit their commercial adoption and use 
one such side effect upon the adoption of our photopoint therapy drug and device products as potential therapeutic agents may be a period of photosensitivity to bright light for a certain period of time after receiving photopoint therapy treatment 
this period of photosensitivity typically declines over time 
currently  this photosensitivity  as it relates to snet  is being considered in the clinical trials 
even upon receiving approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities  our products may later exhibit adverse side effects that prevent widespread use or necessitate withdrawal from the market 
the manifestation of such side effects could cause our business to suffer 
our collaborative partners may control aspects of our clinical trials and regulatory submission that may result in unanticipated delays or termination of our development efforts causing our business to suffer 
our collaborative partners have certain rights to control aspects of our product and device development and clinical programs 
as a result  we may not be able to conduct these programs in the manner we currently contemplate 
pharmacia corporation in accordance with the amendments  we transitioned the majority of the operations of the phase iii amd clinical trials to pharmacia corporation  along with the ophthalmology ind and related filings for snet we will continue to be responsible for the majority of the preclinical studies and the drug and device development and manufacturing necessary for the nda submission in amd 
in january  we announced that pharmacia corporation performed an interim analysis of the month patient data  and has elected to continue the clinical trials to their month conclusion in december subsequently  a full analysis of the safety and efficacy data will be performed and a determination of the status of the snet amd program will be made 
if pharmacia corporation fails to complete the clinical trials as agreed upon or fails to file the nda submission in amd  we may not be able to continue our development program as planned and this could materially harm our business 
iridex in may  we entered into a co development and distribution agreement with iridex  a leading provider of semiconductor based laser systems to treat eye diseases 
the agreement generally provides miravant with the exclusive right to co develop with iridex light producing devices for use in photodynamic therapy in the field of ophthalmology 
we will conduct clinical trials and make regulatory submissions with respect to all co developed devices and iridex will manufacture all devices for such trials  with costs shared as set forth in the agreement 
iridex is currently the sole supplier of the light producing device used in our amd clinical trials 
we currently have limited capabilities  experience and personnel to manufacture the amd light producing device 
if iridex fails to provide the devices as agreed upon  we may not be able to continue our development program as planned and this may harm our business 
because we are relying on our corporate partner  pharmacia corporation  to assist us with and to provide funds to develop our potential ophthalmology products  we could experience delays in our development and our business will suffer  if pharmacia corporation fails to provide us with adequate financial and operational support 
we are relying on pharmacia corporation to provide funds and co develop with us our potential ophthalmology products 
we cannot be certain that pharmacia corporation will continue to fund the co development program 
if pharmacia corporation fails to co develop our products or fails to provide funding as required  we may not be able to continue our development program as we have planned and our business may be materially harmed 
acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain  and failure to achieve market acceptance will harm our business 
even if approved for marketing  our products may not achieve market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products and diagnostic and or imaging techniques  pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators  and the possibility that physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend any of our products 
if our products are not accepted due to these or other factors our business will not develop as planned and may be harmed 
our business is not expected to be profitable for the foreseeable future and we will need additional funds to continue our operations in the future 
if we fail to obtain additional funding  we could be forced to reduce or cease operations 
we will need substantial additional resources to develop our products 
the timing and magnitude of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the costs involved in any potential litigation  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish additional collaborations  changes in existing collaborations  our dependence on others for development and commercialization of our potential products  the cost of manufacturing  marketing and distribution  and the effectiveness of our commercialization activities 
we believe that our cash and anticipated sources of funding  the net proceeds of future offerings and debt or equity financings will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated capital needs through december  we intend to seek any additional capital needed to fund our operations through new collaborations  the extension of our existing collaboration or through public or private equity or debt financings 
however  additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or may be limited based on our credit agreement with pharmacia corporation 
any inability to obtain additional financing would adversely affect our business and could cause us to reduce or cease operations 
we have a history of significant operating losses and expect to continue to have losses in the future  which may fluctuate significantly 
we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant  and possibly increasing  operating losses over the next few years as we continue to incur increasing costs for research and development  preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing and general corporate activities 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our proposed products  obtain the required regulatory clearances and manufacture and market our proposed products 
no revenues have been generated from commercial sales of our drugs and only limited revenues have been generated from sales of our devices 
we do not expect to achieve significant levels of revenues for the next few years 
our revenues to date have consisted of license reimbursements  grants awarded  royalties  milestone payments  payments for our devices  and interest income 
our revenues for the foreseeable future are expected to consist primarily of revenue related to license agreements 
if we are not able to successfully maintain our relationship with pharmacia corporation and establish collaborative and licensing arrangements with others  our business may be harmed 
we have entered into collaborative relationships with certain corporations and academic institutions for the research and development  preclinical studies and clinical trials  licensing  manufacturing  sales and distribution of our products 
these collaborative relationships include the license agreements under which we granted to pharmacia corporation an exclusive worldwide license to use  distribute and sell snet for therapeutic or diagnostic applications in photodynamic therapy for ophthalmology  oncology and urology  definitive agreements with iridex  ramus and xillix for the development of devices for use in photodynamic therapy in the fields of ophthalmology  cardiovascular disease and oncology  respectively  definitive agreement with fresenius for final drug formulation and drug product supply  letter agreements with bsc and cordis for the co development of catheters for use in photodynamic therapy  letter agreement with medicis for the clinical development of photopoint therapy in dermatology  and letter agreement with chiron for the early detection and treatment of lung cancer 
the amount of royalty revenues and other payments  if any  ultimately paid by pharmacia corporation globally to miravant for sales of snet is dependent  in part  on the amount and timing of resources pharmacia corporation commits to research and development  clinical testing and regulatory approval and marketing and sales activities  which are entirely within the control of pharmacia corporation 
pharmacia corporation may not pursue the development and commercialization of snet and or may not perform its obligations as expected 
we have not yet entered into any definitive collaborative agreements with bsc  cordis  medicis or chiron 
these collaborations may not culminate in definitive collaborative agreements or marketable products 
additionally  iridex  ramus and xillix may not continue the development of devices for use in photodynamic therapy  or such development may not result in marketable products 
we are currently at various stages of discussions with some of these and other companies regarding the establishment of collaborations 
our current and future collaborations are important to us because they allow us greater access to funds  to research  development or testing resources and to manufacturing  sales or distribution resources that we would otherwise not have 
we intend to continue to rely on such collaborative arrangements 
some of the risks and uncertainties related to the reliance on collaborations include our ability to negotiate acceptable collaborative arrangements  including those based upon existing letter agreements  future or existing collaborative arrangements may not be successful or may not result in products that are marketed or sold  collaborative relationships  such as our license and credit agreements with pharmacia corporation  may limit or restrict us  collaborative partners are free to pursue alternative technologies or products either on their own or with others  including our competitors  for the diseases targeted by our programs and products  our partners may fail to fulfil their contractual obligations or terminate the relationships described above  and we may be required to seek other partners  or expend substantial resources to pursue these activities independently 
these efforts may not be successful  and our ability to manage  interact and coordinate our timelines and objectives with our strategic partners may not be successful 
we have limited manufacturing and marketing capability and experience and thus rely heavily upon third parties 
prior to our being able to supply drugs for commercial use  our manufacturing facilities must comply with good manufacturing practices  or gmps  as approved by the fda 
in addition  if we elect to outsource manufacturing to third party manufacturers  these facilities also have to satisfy gmp and fda manufacturing requirements 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities under current gmps and must be at acceptable costs 
although we intend to manufacture drugs and devices  we have not yet manufactured any products in commercial quantities under gmps and have no experience in such commercial manufacturing 
we are licensed by the state of california to manufacture bulk drug substance at our santa barbara  california facility for clinical trial and other use 
we currently manufacture the snet drug substance  the process up to the final formulation and packaging step and have the ability to manufacture light producing devices and light delivery devices  and conduct other production and testing activities  at this location 
however  we have limited capabilities  personnel and experience in the manufacture of finished drug product  light producing and light delivery devices and utilize outside suppliers  contracted or otherwise  for certain materials and services related to our manufacturing activities 
we currently have the capacity  in conjunction with our manufacturing suppliers fresenius and iridex  to manufacture products at certain commercial levels and will be able to do so under gmps with subsequent fda approval 
if we receive an fda or other regulatory approval we may need to expand our manufacturing capabilities and or depend on our collaborators  licensees or contract manufacturers for the expanded commercial manufacture of our products 
if we expand our manufacturing capabilities  we will need to expend substantial funds  hire and retain significant additional personnel and comply with extensive regulations 
we may not be able to expand successfully or we may be unable to manufacture products in increased commercial quantities for sale at competitive prices 
further  we may not be able to enter into future manufacturing arrangements with collaborators  licensees  or contract manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are not able to expand our manufacturing capabilities or enter into additional commercial manufacturing agreements  our business growth could be limited and could be materially and adversely affected 
fresenius is the sole manufacturer of the final formulation of our drug product snet and iridex is currently the sole supplier of the light producing devices used in our amd clinical trials 
both have commercial quantity capabilities 
we have no direct experience in marketing  distributing and selling pharmaceutical or medical device products 
we will need to develop a sales force or rely on our collaborators or licensees or make arrangements with others to provide for the marketing  distribution and sale of our products 
we currently intend to rely on pharmacia corporation and iridex for these needs for the amd project 
our marketing  distribution and sales capabilities or current or future arrangements with third parties for such activities may not be adequate for the successful commercialization of our products 
our ability to establish and maintain agreements with outside suppliers may not be successful and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
we depend on outside suppliers for certain raw materials and components for our products 
such raw materials or components may not continue to be available to our standards or on acceptable terms  if at all  and alternative suppliers may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  we may not be able to adequately produce needed materials or components in house 
we are currently dependent on single  contracted sources for a couple of key materials or services used by us in our drug development  light producing and light delivery device development and production operations 
although most of our raw materials and components are available from various sources  we are currently developing qualified backup suppliers for each of these resources 
we have or will enter into agreements with these suppliers  which may or may not be successful or which may encounter delays or other problems  which may materially adversely affect our business 
we may not have adequate protection against product liability or recall 
the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of human pharmaceutical products entails significant inherent  industry wide risks of allegations of product liability 
the use of our products in clinical trials and the sale of our products may expose us to liability claims 
these claims could be made directly by patients or consumers  or by companies  institutions or others using or selling our products 
the following are some of the risks related to liability and recall we are subject to the inherent risk that a governmental authority or third party may require the recall of one or more of our products  we have not obtained liability insurance that would cover a claim relating to the clinical or commercial use or recall of our products  in the absence of liability insurance  claims made against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on us  if we obtain insurance coverage in the future  this coverage may not be available at a reasonable cost and in amounts sufficient to protect us against claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects  and liability claims relating to our products or a product recall could negatively effect our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our products 
we have agreed to indemnify certain of our collaborative partners against certain potential liabilities relating to the manufacture and sale of snet and photopoint therapy light devices 
a successful product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  our patents and our proprietary technology 
our success will depend  in part  on our and our licensors ability to obtain  assert and defend our patents  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
the exclusive license relating to various drug compounds  including our leading drug candidate snet  may become non exclusive if we fail to satisfy certain development and commercialization objectives 
the termination or restriction of our rights under this or other licenses for any reason would likely have a material adverse impact on our business  our financial condition and results of our operations 
although we believe we should be able to achieve such objectives  we may not be successful 
the patent position of pharmaceutical and medical device firms generally is highly uncertain 
some of the risks and uncertainties include the patent applications owned by or licensed to us may not result in issued patents  our issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages  our issued patents may be infringed upon or designed around by others  our issued patents may be challenged by others and held to be invalid or unenforceable  the patents of others may have a material adverse effect on us  and significant time and funds may be necessary to defend our patents 
we are aware that our competitors and others have been issued patents relating to photodynamic therapy 
in addition  our competitors and others may have been issued patents or filed patent applications relating to other potentially competitive products of which we are not aware 
further  our competitors and others may in the future file applications for  or otherwise obtain proprietary rights to  such products 
these existing or future patents  applications or rights may conflict with our or our licensors patents or applications 
such conflicts could result in a rejection of our or our licensors applications or the invalidation of the patents 
this could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
if such conflicts occur  or if we believe that such products may infringe on our proprietary rights  we may pursue litigation or other proceedings  or may be required to defend against such litigation 
such proceedings may materially adversely affect our competitive position  and we may not be successful in any such proceeding 
litigation and other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming  regardless of whether we prevail 
this can result in the diversion of substantial financial  managerial and other resources from other activities 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to cease any related research and development activities or product sales 
some of the risks and uncertainties include we do not have contractual indemnification rights against the licensors of the various drug patents  we may be required to obtain licenses under dominating or conflicting patents or other proprietary rights of others  such licenses may not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and if we do not obtain such licenses  we could encounter delays or could find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed 
we also seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners  employees and consultants 
these agreements could be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
also  our trade secrets may become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
certain research activities relating to the development of certain patents owned by or licensed to us were funded  in part  by agencies of the united states government 
when the united states government participates in research activities  it retains certain rights that include the right to use the resulting patents for government purposes under a royalty free license 
we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology  or that we can meaningfully protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets and know how 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel and consultants 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  management and other personnel and to develop and maintain relationships with leading research institutions and consultants 
we are highly dependent upon principal members of our management  key employees  scientific staff and consultants which we may retain from time to time 
competition for such personnel and relationships is intense  and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
our consultants may be affiliated with or employed by others  and some have consulting or other advisory arrangements with other entities that may conflict or compete with their obligations to us 
inventions or processes discovered by such persons will not necessarily become our property and may remain the property of such persons or others 
if outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised  the value of our common stock outstanding just prior to the exercise may be diluted 
as of march   there were outstanding stock options to purchase  shares of common stock  with exercise prices ranging from to per share  with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in addition  as of march   there were outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  with exercise prices ranging from to per share  with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
if the holders exercise a significant number of these securities at any one time  the market price of the common stock could fall and the value of the common stock held by other stockholders may be diluted 
the holders of the options and warrants have the opportunity to profit if the market price for the common stock exceeds the exercise price of their respective securities  without assuming the risk of ownership 
if the market price of the common stock does not rise above the exercise price of these securities  then they will probably not be exercised and may expire based on their respective expiration dates 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
from time to time and in particular during the last fiscal year  the price of our common stock has been highly volatile 
these fluctuations create a greater risk of capital losses for our stockholders as compared to less volatile stocks 
from january  to december   our common stock price  per the nasdaq closing price  has ranged from a high of to a low of 
the market prices for our common stock  and the securities of emerging pharmaceutical and medical device companies  have historically been highly volatile and subject to extreme price fluctuations  which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
extreme price fluctuations could be the result of the following future announcements concerning miravant or our collaborators  competitors or industry  the results of our testing  technological innovations or new commercial products  the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials by us or our competitors  technological innovations or new therapeutic products  litigation  public concern as to the safety  efficacy or marketability of products developed by us or others  comments by securities analysts  the achievement of or failure to achieve certain milestones  and governmental regulations  rules and orders  or developments concerning safety of our products 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many emerging pharmaceutical and medical device companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent transactions that could be beneficial to stockholders 
our charter and bylaws restrict certain actions by our stockholders 
for example our stockholders can act at a duly called annual or special meeting but they may not act by written consent  special meetings can only be called by our chief executive officer  president  or secretary at the written request of a majority of our board of directors  and stockholders also must give advance notice to the secretary of any nominations for director or other business to be brought by stockholders at any stockholders meeting 
some of these restrictions can only be amended by a super majority vote of members of the board and or the stockholders 
these and other provisions of our charter and bylaws  as well as certain provisions of delaware law  could prevent changes in our management and discourage  delay or prevent a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if the events could be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 
in addition  our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of undesignated preferred stock without stockholder approval on terms that the board may determine 
the issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to our other stockholders or otherwise adversely affect their rights and powers  including voting rights 
moreover  the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for another party to acquire  or may discourage another party from acquiring  voting control of us 
effecting a change of control of miravant would be difficult  which may discourage offers for shares of our common stock 
our board of directors has adopted a preferred stockholder rights plan 
the plan may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing changes in our management or control of miravant  which may discourage potential acquirers who otherwise might wish to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors 
under the plan  if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock  all holders of rights other than the acquiring stockholder may  upon payment of the purchase price then in effect  purchase common stock having a value of twice the purchase price 
in the event that we are involved in a merger or other similar transaction where miravant is not the surviving corporation  all holders of rights other than the acquiring stockholder shall be entitled  upon payment of the then in effect purchase price  to purchase common stock of the surviving corporation having a value of twice the purchase price 
the rights will expire on july   unless previously redeemed 
our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in integrating business combinations and strategic alliances 
we may expand our operations and market presence by entering into business combinations  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies 
these transactions create risks  such as the difficulty assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  the disruption or our ongoing business  including loss of management focus on existing businesses and other market developments  problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  expenses associated with the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  additional operating losses and expenses of acquired businesses  the impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners  and  additional losses from any equity investments we might make 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks  and we may not be able to make business combinations and strategic investments on terms that are acceptable to us 
in addition  any businesses we may acquire may incur operating losses 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities are all located in the state of california and are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in addition  we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our industry we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reimbursement and reform 
our products may not be covered by the various health care providers and third party payors 
if they are not covered  our products may or may not be purchased or sold as expected 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatment will be available from collaborative partners  government health administration authorities  private health insurers  managed care entities and other organizations 
these payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services and establishing protocols and formularies  which effectively limit physicians ability to select products and procedures 
uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of health care products  especially innovative technologies 
additionally  reimbursement coverage  if available  may not be adequate to enable us to achieve market acceptance of our products or to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our products 
the efforts of governments and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare will continue to affect our business and financial condition as a biotechnology company 
in foreign markets  pricing or profitability of medical products and services may be subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for government control of pricing and profitability 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed healthcare has increased pressure on pricing of medical products and will continue to do so 
these cost controls may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability and may affect our ability to raise additional capital 
in addition  cost control initiatives could adversely affect our business in a number of ways  including decreasing the price we  or any of our partners or licensees  receive for any of our products  preventing the recovery of development costs  which could be substantial  and minimizing profit margins 
further  our commercialization strategy depends on our collaborators 
as a result  our ability to commercialize our products and realize royalties may be hindered if cost control initiatives adversely affect our collaborators 
failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development  preclinical studies and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and in other countries 
all drugs and most medical devices we develop must undergo rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process administered by the fda under the fdc act  and comparable foreign authorities  before they can be marketed 
these processes involve substantial cost and can often take many years 
we have limited experience in  and limited resources available for regulatory activities and we rely on our collaborators and outside consultants 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in non approval  suspensions of regulatory approvals  fines  product seizures and recalls  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
to date  none of our product candidates being developed have been submitted for approval or have been approved by the fda or any other regulatory authority for marketing 
some of the risks and uncertainties relating to united states government regulation include delays in obtaining approval or rejections due to regulatory review of each submitted new drug  device or combination drug device application or product license application  as well as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development  if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed  if regulatory approval is obtained  the product  our manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections  if regulatory approval is obtained  such approval may be conditional on the satisfaction of the completion of clinical trials or require additional clinical trials  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market and litigation  and photodynamic therapy products have been categorized by the fda as combination photodynamic therapy products 
if current or future drug device products do not continue to be categorized for regulatory purposes as combination products  then the fda may require separate drug and device submissions  and the fda may require separate approval by regulatory authorities 
some of the risks and uncertainties of international governmental regulation include foreign regulatory requirements governing testing  development  marketing  licensing  pricing and or distribution of drugs and devices in other countries  our drug products may not qualify for the centralized review procedure or we may not be able to obtain a national market application that will be accepted by other eu member states  our devices must also meet the new medical device directive effective in europe in the directive requires that our manufacturing quality assurance systems and compliance with technical essential requirements be certified with a ce mark authorized by a registered notified body of an eu member state prior to free sale in the eu  and registration and approval of a photodynamic therapy product in other countries  such as japan  may include additional procedures and requirements  nonclinical and clinical studies  and may require the assistance of native corporate partners 
we may not be able to keep up with rapid changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries that could make some or all of our products non competitive or obsolete 
competing products and technologies may make some or all of our programs or potential products noncompetitive or obsolete 
our industry is subject to rapid  unpredictable and significant technological change 
competition is intense 
well known pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical companies are marketing well established therapies for the treatment of amd 
doctors may prefer familiar methods that they are comfortable using rather than try our products 
many companies are also seeking to develop new products and technologies for medical conditions for which we are developing treatments 
our competitors may succeed in developing products that are safer or more effective than ours and in obtaining regulatory marketing approval of future products before we do 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition as new companies enter our markets and as the scientific development of photopoint therapy evolves 
we expect that our principal methods of competition with other photodynamic therapy companies will be based upon such factors as the ease of administration of our photodynamic therapy  the degree of generalized skin sensitivity to light  the number of required doses  the safety and efficacy profile  the selectivity of our drug for the target lesion or tissue of interest  the type and cost of our light systems  and the cost of our drug 
we cannot give you any assurance that new drugs or future developments in photodynamic therapy or in other drug technologies will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
increased competition could result in price reductions  lower levels of third party reimbursements  failure to achieve market acceptance  and loss of market share 
any of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
further  we cannot give you any assurance that developments by our competitors or future competitors will not render our technology obsolete 
we face intense competition and technological uncertainty 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do  and may also have substantially greater experience in developing products  conducting preclinical studies or clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing 
further  our competitive position could be materially adversely affected by the establishment of patent protection by our competitors 
the existing competitors or other companies may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more safe  effective or affordable than those being developed by us or that would render our technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
we are aware that other companies are marketing or developing certain products to prevent  diagnose or treat diseases for which we are developing photopoint therapy 
these products  as well as others of which we may not be aware  may adversely affect the existing or future market for our products 
competitive products may include  but are not limited to  drugs such as those designed to inhibit angiogenesis or otherwise target new blood vessels  certain medical devices  and other photodynamic therapy treatments 
we are aware of various competitors involved in the photodynamic therapy sector 
we understand that these companies are conducting preclinical studies and or clinical trials in various countries and for a variety of disease indications 
one company is qlt inc  or qlt 
we understand that qlt s drug visudyne has received marketing approval in the united states and certain other countries for the treatment of amd 
qlt is therefore first to market in this disease area 
we understand that at least two other photodynamic therapy drugs have received marketing approval in the united states photofrin r qlt axcan pharmaceuticals for the treatment of certain oncology indications and levulan r dusa pharmaceuticals berlex laboratories for the treatment of actinic keratoses  a dermatological condition 
we are aware of other drugs and devices under development by these and other photodynamic therapy competitors  such as pharmacyclics  in disease areas for which we are developing photopoint therapy 
these competitors may develop superior products or reach the market prior to photopoint therapy and render our products non competitive or obsolete 
the pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
developments by others may render our products under development or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete  or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors 
technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
acquisitions of  or investments in  competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors financial  marketing  manufacturing and other resources 
we are a relatively new enterprise and are engaged in the development of novel therapeutic technologies  specifically photodynamic therapy 
as a result  our resources are limited and we may experience technical challenges inherent in such novel technologies 
competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic  diagnostic and imaging effects than our products 
we are aware that one of our competitors in the market for photodynamic therapy drugs has received marketing approval of a product for certain uses in the united states and other countries 
our competitors may develop products that are safer  more effective or less costly than our products and  therefore  present a serious competitive threat to our product offerings 
the widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our products even if commercialized 
the diseases for which we are developing our therapeutic products can also be treated  in the case of cancer  by surgery  radiation and chemotherapy  and in the case of atherosclerosis  by surgery  angioplasty  drug therapy and the use of devices to maintain and open blood vessels 
these treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products to receive widespread acceptance if commercialized 
our understanding of the market opportunities for our photopoint therapy is derived from a variety of sources  and represents our best estimate of the overall market sizes presented in certain disease areas 
the actual market size and market share which we may be able to obtain may vary substantially from our estimates  and is dependent upon a number of factors  including competitive treatments  either existing or those that may arise in the future  performance of our products and subsequent labeling claims  and actual patient population at and beyond product launch 
our products are subject to other state and federal laws  future legislation and regulations 
in addition to the regulations for drug or device approvals  we are subject to regulation under state  federal or other law  including regulations for worker occupational safety  laboratory practices  environmental protection and hazardous substance control 
we continue to make capital and operational expenditures for protection of the environment in amounts which are not material 
some of the risks and uncertainties related to laws and future legislation or regulations include our future capital and operational expenditures related to these matters may increase and become material  we may also be subject to other present and possible future local  state  federal and foreign regulation  heightened public awareness and concerns regarding the growth in overall health care expenditures in the united states  combined with the continuing efforts of governmental authorities to contain or reduce costs of health care  may result in the enactment of national health care reform or other legislation or regulations that impose limits on the number and type of medical procedures which may be performed or which have the effect of restricting a physician s ability to select specific products for use in certain procedures  such new legislation or regulations may materially adversely affect the demand for our products 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state legislative proposals and regulations to implement greater governmental control in the health care industry  the announcement of such proposals may materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or to form collaborations  and legislation or regulations that impose restrictions on the price that may be charged for health care products or medical devices may adversely affect our results of operations 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of adverse effects which might arise from future legislative or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
our business involves environmental risks 
we are subject to federal  state  county and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
in the course of our business  we are involved in the handling  storage and disposal of materials that are classified as hazardous 
our safety procedures for the handling  storage and disposal of such materials are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
however  we may be involved in contamination or injury from these materials 
if this occurs  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could materially and adversely affect us 
further  the cost of complying with these laws and regulations may increase materially in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the risks related to foreign currency exchange rates are immaterial and we do not use derivative financial instruments 
from time to time  we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase 
given the short term nature of these investments and that our borrowings outstanding are under variable interest rates  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk
