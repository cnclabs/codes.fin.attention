see competition 
marketing and sales anton markets and sells its products throughout new england via telemarketing  a retail store and its own catalog  and an inside and outside sales force 
conway s marketing and sales are achieved through flyers and direct calls from inside and outside sales force 
competition all of anton s and conway s fire  police and rescue products are subject to competition 
some of this competition is through companies utilizing direct mail or telemarketing efforts 
despite the presence of competition  anton and conway believes its sales force  extensive inventory  and emphasis on service give them a slight edge over the competition 
anton s sales had been declining since due to increased competition as competitors opened new locations in anton s territories  however  for the first six months of they have seen an increase in sales 
in march  michael and paula anton opened a business similar to anton s business located in the same area

retail pharmacies business eaton apothecary in august  we acquired of daw  inc d b a eaton apothecary  eaton  an store chain of pharmacies operating in the greater boston area 
each of the five minority shareholders except in one case  the husband of a shareholder continue employment under an oral agreement 
their five year employment contract with eaton which commenced in august expired august  control of the board of directors of eaton is split between representatives from nyer and the minority shareholders 
additionally  one member of eaton s management occupies a seat on our board of directors 
the competitiveness of the retail pharmacy market continues to intensify with many different channels of retail and non retail competition 
all of the stores posted sales increases despite continued competition from national chain drug stores  supermarket chains  hmo s  and internet services 
eaton s management strategy is to move in the opposite direction from the national chains regarding store size  merchandise mix and store locations 
its strategy to develop its prototype of locations with approximately  square feet with high volume prescrip tion departments in neighborhood locations has fared well over the past several years 
virtually all of eaton s stores compete head to head with cvs and walgreen stores 
pharmacies in supermarkets and deep discount stores  such as walmart  have not gained significant market share in the communities served by eaton 
eaton currently occupies a niche in the market not covered by the larger chain stores 
average store size is approximately  square feet versus  to  for the average chain  with the pharmacy department as the central focus to the customer 
eaton offers free delivery service of prescription medication to its clientele 
this customer benefit gives eaton an important competitive advantage in inclement weather and with the shut in customer 
eaton operates eight full time delivery vehicles with each vehicle averaging deliveries per day 
this service allows eaton the ability to reach a broader geographic market and the ability to locate its stores in neighborhood settings rather than in high traffic  high cost shopping centers 
any willing provider legislation passed in massachusetts has enabled eaton to serve the harvard pilgrim hmo as well as many other previously locked out sectors of the retail pharmacy market 
because of the increased available market  management expects sales growth to be positive  but with continuing pressure on margins 
therefore  management continues to focus energies on cost reductions from suppliers and cost containment at store level 
assisted living facilities are transitory facilities for elderly patients unable to live at home alone but not brittle enough to require nursing home care 
the us census predicts this market segment to be the largest growing housing sector in the nation over the next decade 
because these homes do not offer nursing care  yet cater to residents unable to manage their own medications  eaton s management has recognized a tremendous opportunity to couple its prescription and delivery expertise to out service the chain stores 
eaton s investment in specialized packaging equipment was with the intent of offering a fool proof medication management system to residents in assisted living facilities 
eaton added an additional medicine on timetm packaging system 
this licensed packaging system caters to elderly clients who are unable to manage their medication regimens yet who are not frail enough for nursing home care 
in addition to growth in the assisted living and home bound sectors  many new customers have been gained by word of mouth throughout the visiting nurse and health center communities
