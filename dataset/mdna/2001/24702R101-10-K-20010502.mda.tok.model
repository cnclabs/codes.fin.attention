patents  trademarks and licenses the company holds a portfolio of us patents and us patent applications pending  and has a number of related foreign patents and patent applications pending 
the company s us patents expire in years through the inventions claimed in those patents and patent applications cover aspects of the company s current and possible future computer system products  manufacturing processes and related technologies 
the company is developing a portfolio of 
table of contents patents that it anticipates will be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry 
the company has obtained us federal trademark registration for its dell word mark and its dell logo mark 
the company owns registrations for of its other marks in the us as of march   the company had pending applications for registration of other trademarks 
the dell word mark  dell logo and other trademark and service mark registrations in the us may be renewed as long as the mark continues to be used in interstate commerce 
the company believes that establishment of the dell mark and logo in the us is material to the company s operations 
the company has also applied for or obtained registration of the dell mark and several other marks in approximately other countries or jurisdictions where the company conducts or anticipates expanding its international business 
the company has also registered approximately global domain names 
in addition  the company has registered in excess of country specific domain names 
the company has also taken steps to reserve corporate names and to form non operating subsidiaries in certain foreign countries where the company anticipates expanding its international business 
the company has entered into a variety of intellectual property licensing and cross licensing agreements 
in addition  the company has entered into nonexclusive licensing agreements with microsoft corporation for various operating system and application software 
the company has also entered into various software licensing agreements with other companies 
from time to time  other companies and individuals assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or marks that are important to the technology industry or the company s business 
the company evaluates each claim relating to its products and  if appropriate  seeks a license to use the protected technology 
the licensing agreements generally do not require the licensor to assist the company in duplicating its patented technology nor do these agreements protect the company from trade secret  copyright or other violations by the company or its suppliers in developing or selling these products 
see item business factors affecting the company s business and prospects patent rights for information about intellectual property risks 
infrastructure management information systems the company s management information systems enable the company to track each unit sold from the initial sales contact  through the manufacturing process to post sale service and support 
the systems assist the company in tracking key information about customer needs 
using its database to assess customer trends  the company targets marketing activities specifically to particular types of customers 
this database  unique to the company s direct model  allows the company to gauge customer satisfaction issues and also provides the opportunity to test new propositions in the marketplace prior to product or service introductions 
employees on february   the company had approximately  regular employees 
approximately  of those employees were located in the us  and approximately  were located in other countries 
the company has never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believes that its employee relations are good 
government regulation the company s business is subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies 
such regulation includes the radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the us federal communications commission  the anti trust regulatory activities of the us federal 
table of contents trade commission and department of justice  the import export regulatory activities of the us department of commerce and the product safety regulatory activities of the us consumer products safety commission 
the company also is required to obtain regulatory approvals in other countries prior to the sale or shipment of products 
in certain jurisdictions  such requirements are more stringent than in the us many developing nations are just beginning to establish safety  environmental and other regulatory requirements  which may vary greatly from us requirements 
backlog the company does not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales that can be expected for any period  and there can be no assurance that the backlog at any point in time will translate into sales in any subsequent period 
at the end of fiscal year   and  backlog was not material 
factors affecting the company s business and prospects there are many factors that affect the company s business and the results of its operations  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause the actual results of the company s operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 
general economic and industry conditions any general economic  business or industry conditions that cause customers or potential customers to reduce or delay their investments in computer systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  prospects and financial performance 
worldwide economic conditions could have an effect on the demand for the company s products and could result in declining revenue and earnings growth rates for the company 
competition the company encounters aggressive competition in all aspects of its business 
the company competes on the basis of price  technology availability  performance  quality  reliability  service and support 
the company believes that it can maintain profitability by reducing operating expenses and by continuing to leverage its lean inventory model to rapidly realize the benefit of component price declines 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can successfully continue to manage its operating expenses to mitigate declines in gross margins 
international activities sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal year the company s future growth rates and success are dependent on continued growth and success in international markets 
as is the case with most international operations  the success and profitability of the company s international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including local economic and labor conditions  political instability  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  trade protection measures  tax laws including us taxes on foreign operations and foreign currency exchange rates 
product  customer and geographic mix the profit margins realized by the company vary somewhat among its products  customers and geographic markets 
consequently  the overall profitability of the company s operations in any given period is partially dependent on the product  customer and geographic mix reflected in that period s revenues 

table of contents seasonal trends the company experiences some seasonal trends in the sale of its products 
for example  sales to governments particularly us federal sales are often stronger in the company s third quarter  european sales are often weaker in the third quarter and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth quarter 
historically  the net result of seasonal trends has not been material relative to the company s overall results of operations  but many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond the company s control 
technological changes and product transitions the technology industry is characterized by continuing improvements in technology  which results in the frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price performance characteristics 
while the company believes that its direct model and asset management practices afford it an inherent competitive advantage over some of its competitors  product transitions present some of the greatest executional challenges and risks for any computer systems company 
a failure on the part of the company to effectively manage a product transition will directly affect the demand for the company s products and the profitability of the company s operations 
in addition  while the company has meaningful relationships with some of the world s most advanced technology companies  continuing technological advancement  which is a significant driver of customer demand  is largely beyond the control of the company 
inventory management supplies the company s direct business model gives it the ability to operate with reduced levels of component and finished goods inventories  and the company s financial success in recent periods has been due in part to its asset management practices  including its ability to achieve rapid inventory turns 
however  temporary disruptions in component availability can unfavorably affect the company s short term performance 
supply conditions have generally been favorable both to the company and to the industry in recent years 
however  less favorable supply conditions  as well as other factors  may require or result in increased inventory levels in the future 
the company s manufacturing process requires a high volume of quality components that are procured from third party suppliers 
reliance on suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of defective parts which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of the company s products  a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules which can adversely affect the company s manufacturing efficiencies and increases in component costs which can adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company has several single sourced supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance  quality  support  delivery  capacity or price considerations 
if these sources are unable to provide timely and reliable supply  the company could experience manufacturing interruptions  delays or inefficiencies  adversely affecting its results of operations 
even where alternative sources of supply are available  qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales  which could affect operating results adversely 
risk on financial instruments the company regularly utilizes derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  the company utilizes equity instrument contracts to execute repurchases of its common stock under its board authorized stock repurchase program 
some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
for 
table of contents additional information about risk on financial instruments  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 
strength of infrastructure the company s continued success and profitability partly depends on its ability to continue to improve its infrastructure particularly personnel and information systems in order to increase operational efficiencies 
patent rights the company s continued business success may be largely dependent on its ability to obtain licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to obtain desirable technology licenses  the company could be prohibited from marketing products  could be forced to market products without desirable features or could incur substantial costs to redesign its products  defend legal actions or pay damages 
equity investments the company has an active venture capital program  through which the company makes strategic equity investments primarily in privately held technology companies 
see item business dell ventures 
because these companies are typically early stage ventures with either unproven business models  products that are not yet fully developed or products that have not yet achieved market acceptance  these investments are inherently risky 
many factors outside of the company s control determine whether or not the company s investments will be successful 
such factors include the ability of a company to obtain additional private equity financing  to access the public capital markets  to effect a sale or merger  or to achieve commercial success with its products or services 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that any of the company s investments will be successful or that the company will be able to recover the amount invested
