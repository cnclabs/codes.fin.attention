item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the reported results of metropolitan financial corp 
metropolitan  the corporation  we  our  or us primarily reflect the operations of metropolitan bank and trust company the bank 
our results of operations are dependent on a variety of factors  including the general interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the industry  governmental policies and regulations and conditions in the markets for financial assets 
like most financial institutions  the primary contributor to our income is net interest income  the difference between the interest we earn on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
our operations are also affected by noninterest income  such as loan servicing fees  service charges on deposit accounts  and gains or losses on the sale of loans and securities 
our principal operating expenses  aside from interest expense  consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy costs  and general and administrative expenses 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income decreased from net income of net income for was million  or per common share  and net income for was million  or per common share 
this decrease in net income from was due primarily to a decrease in our interest rate spread due to rising interest rates during and higher operational costs due to growth in the retail sales office system  the relocation of the corporate headquarters  and investments in technology 
total assets grew to billion at december  from billion at december  compared to and prior years  asset growth slowed in due to the rising interest rate environment 
we expect limited asset growth to continue in the near future until we improve our capital ratios to well capitalized levels 
interest income 
total interest income increased to million for from million for this increase was due to a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and an increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets  particularly loans 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased to million for from million for interest expense increased primarily because the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased from the prior year and an increased cost of funds 
we increased our average balance of interest bearing liabilities in order to fund our growth of interest earning assets 
the average balance of borrowings increased from the previous year 
due to an increase in market rates paid to deposit customers and the increased use of borrowings  the cost of funds increased to in from in net interest margin 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
our net interest margin declined basis points to for from for net interest margin declined because asset yields did not increase in proportion to liability costs while average interest earning assets as a percent of average interest bearing liabilities remained relatively constant 
the yield on interest earning assets increased due primarily to the higher yield on loans 
this increase in the yield on interest earning assets was more than offset by an increased cost of funds 
average balances and yields 
the following table presents the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resulting rates  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
net interest margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

our provision for loan losses increased thousand to million in from million in management increased the provision due to the ongoing analysis of the appropriate allowance for loan losses as the bank continues to grow and increases its amount of loans  and not as a response to any material change in the level of nonperforming loans 
total loans  including loans held for sale  increased to billion at december  from billion at the same date a year earlier 
the allowance for losses on loans at december  was million  or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans  at the same date in management bases its estimate of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on loans on an analysis of various factors 
these factors include historical loan loss experience  the status of impaired loans  economic conditions affecting real estate markets and regulatory considerations 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased to million in from million in this increase occurred primarily because of the increase in our gain on sale of loans and gain on sale of securities 
net gain on sale of loans increased to million in compared to million in the primary reason for the increase in was the stabilization of interest rates  particularly in the second half of the year in compared to in addition  we added four loan origination offices which added to the volume of loans available for sale 
the proceeds of residential loan sales in was million compared to million in net loan servicing income decreased to million in from million in the portfolio of loans serviced increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  purchases of loan servicing rights and origination of loan servicing  including the securitization of our loans  were offset by payoffs and greater amortization of existing loans serviced 
in  we sold servicing rights for approximately million of loans in the fourth quarter  and recognized a gain of thousand 
we remain committed to servicing loans for others 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to million in from million in the primary reasons for the increase were the overall growth in the number of checking accounts and increases in deposit fees in during  we sold million of mortgage backed securities available for sale for a net gain of thousand 
we purchase or sell securities and mortgage backed securities for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include the management of liquidity  interest rate risk  capital levels  collateral levels for borrowings  and to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
we do not currently hold any securities for trading purposes 
gains or losses from the sale of securities are incidental to the sale of those securities for the reasons listed above 
other operating income increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of a writedown of thousand of the bank s investment in a limited partnership which services residential real estate loans due to a permanent decline in the value of the investment 
the increase was also due to increased fee income from the increased level of business and increased rental income during noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in this increase in expenses resulted primarily from increased staffing requirements due to greater business volume and greater occupancy expenses 
personnel related expenses increased to million in from million in these increases were a result of increased staffing levels to support new retail sales offices  new mortgage origination offices  and increased business levels 
occupancy and equipment expense increased to million in from million in this increase was generally the result of opening three retail sales offices and two additional mortgage origination offices opened in along with  spent on our move to our new corporate headquarters 
presently  we plan to open two additional retail sales offices by the end of federal deposit insurance premiums increased to million in compared to thousand in the reason for the increase was the increase in the bank s premium rate charged by the federal deposit insurance corp 
marketing expense increased to million for from thousand for this increase was the result of the promotion of brand awareness primarily through radio advertising in current and new markets and attracting new deposit customers 
state franchise taxes increased to million for as compared to thousand in the primary reason for the increase is the greater amount of capital at the bank  which is the basis for the tax 
data processing expense increased to million for the year as compared to million in this increase was the result of expenses incurred for electronic banking which is scheduled to begin in and overall increases in data processing costs related to a systems conversion which took place in september   and for additional retail sales offices and an increase in the number of customer accounts 
other operating expenses  which includes miscellaneous general and administrative costs such as loan servicing  business development  check processing and atm expenses  increased to million for from million for generally  these increases were due to expenses pertaining to increased business activities  real estate owned expenses  and increased costs for professional services 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased to thousand in from million in due to the decrease in income before taxes 
the effective tax rate was for and for comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income for decreased from net income for net income for was million  or per common share  and net income for was million  or per common share 
net income for was reduced by an extraordinary expense of thousand  net of tax  or per common share 
net income before the extraordinary item was million for  or per common share 
this decrease in net income from to was due to a increase in the provision for loan losses  declines in gain on sales of loans due to rising interest rates during  and higher operational costs due to growth and expansion 
total assets grew to billion at december  from billion at december  compared to and prior years  asset growth slowed in due to the rising interest rate environment 
interest income 
total interest income increased to million for from million for this increase was due to a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the increase in interest income attributable to the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets was partially offset by the decline in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets  particularly loans receivable 
this decline in weighted average yield was due primarily to nonresidential real estate loans added to the loan portfolio late in which remained in the portfolio during and loan securitizations which lowered the yield in interest expense 
total interest expense increased to million for from million for interest expense increased primarily because the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased in from we increased our average balance of interest bearing liabilities in order to fund our growth of interest earning assets 
the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased from to the average balance of borrowings increased in from due to a decrease in market rates paid to deposit customers and the use of short term borrowings  the cost of funds declined to in from in this decline in the cost of deposits and borrowings was partially offset by the increased cost of the additional junior subordinated debentures issued in net interest margin 
the net interest margin declined basis points to for from for net interest margin declined because asset yields declined more than liability costs while average interest earning assets as a percent of average interest bearing liabilities did not change significantly between years 
the yield on interest earning assets decreased due to the declining yield on loans 
this decline in the yield on interest earning assets was partially offset by a decline in our cost of funds 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of 
management increased the provision due to the ongoing analysis of the appropriate allowance for loan losses considering historical loan loss experience  the status of impaired loans  economic conditions affecting real estate markets and regulatory considerations 
nonperforming loans were million at december   compared to million at december  total loans  including loans held for sale  increased to billion at december  from billion at the same date a year earlier 
the allowance for losses on loans at december  was million  or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans  at the same date in noninterest income 
total noninterest income decreased to million in from million in this decrease occurred primarily because of the decline in the gain on sale of loans which was offset by increased loan servicing income  including a gain on the sale of loan servicing  and increased service charges on deposit accounts 
net gain on sale of loans decreased to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the decline in was the rise in long term interest rates experienced in as compared to the interest rate rise led to a decline in fixed rate loan origination and resulted in less loans to sell 
the proceeds of residential loan sales in was million as compared to million in net loan servicing income increased to million in from thousand in this increase in net loan servicing fees was a result of the strategy to increase fee income 
the portfolio of loans serviced increased to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  purchases of loan servicing rights and origination of loan servicing  including the securitization of our loans  more than offset payoffs and amortization of existing loans serviced 
in  we sold servicing rights for approximately million of loans in the fourth quarter  and recognized a gain of thousand 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired loan servicing rights to approximately million of loans which were not included in the total loans serviced at december  service charges on deposit accounts increased to million in from thousand in the primary reasons for the increase were the overall growth in deposit accounts and increases in individual account charges in during  we sold million of mortgage backed securities available for sale for a net loss of thousand 
also  during  we sold million of securities available for sale in which no gain or loss was recorded 
loan option income was thousand in compared to thousand in during  we did not purchase any loans for option transactions compared to million in the loan option income recorded was for loans purchased in and sold in other operating income increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased fee income from the increased level of business and increased rental income 
these increases were partially offset by a writedown of thousand of the bank s investment in a limited partnership which services residential real estate loans due to a permanent decline in the value of the investment 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in this increase in expenses resulted primarily from growth in assets and increased staffing requirements due to greater business volume 
personnel related expenses increased to million in from million in these increases were a result of increased staffing levels to support expanded activities such as new retail sales offices and new mortgage origination offices 
occupancy and equipment expense increased to million in from million in generally  these expenses increased as a result of three additional retail sales offices and three mortgage origination offices opened during as part of the plan to expand mortgage banking operations  residential loan production offices were opened during in the akron and canton  ohio areas and a residential loan construction office was opened in the columbus  ohio market 
in addition  the construction of a new corporate headquarters in highland hills  ohio we commenced during federal deposit insurance premiums increased to thousand in as compared to thousand in the reason for the increase was the overall increase in deposits  which is the basis for the premium amount 
marketing expense decreased to thousand for from thousand for this reduction was the result of a decision to decrease advertising at a time when rates were higher and there was less loan activity taking place 
state franchise taxes increased to thousand for as compared to thousand in the primary reason for the increase was the greater amount of capital at the bank  which is the basis for the tax 
data processing expense increased to million for the year as compared to thousand in this increase was the result of expenses incurred for consulting services and year testing and data processing costs related to the new retail sales and origination offices 
other operating expenses  which includes miscellaneous general and administrative costs such as loan servicing  business development  check processing and atm expenses  increased to million for from million for generally  these increases were due to expenses pertaining to increased business activities  real estate owned expenses  and increased costs for professional services 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in due to the decrease in income before taxes 
the effective tax rate was for and for the effective tax rate in was lower due to an increase in the level of tax exempt interest in as compared to asset quality nonperforming assets 
our goal is to maintain high quality loans in the loan portfolio through conservative lending policies and prudent underwriting 
we undertake detailed reviews of the loan portfolio regularly to identify potential problem loans or trends early and to provide for adequate estimates of potential losses 
in performing these reviews  management considers  among other things  current economic conditions  portfolio characteristics  delinquency trends  and historical loss experiences 
we normally consider loans to be nonperforming when payments are days or more past due or when the loan review analysis indicates that repossession of the collateral may be necessary to satisfy the loan 
in addition  a loan is considered impaired when  in management s opinion  it is probable that the borrower will be unable to meet the contractual terms of the loan 
when loans are classified as nonperforming  we assess the collectibility of the unpaid interest 
interest determined to be uncollectible is reversed from interest income 
future interest income is recorded only if the loan principal and interest due is considered collectible and is less than the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
the table below provides the amounts and categories of our nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated 
at december   all loans classified as impaired were also classified as nonperforming 
december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans one to four family  multifamily commercial real estate    construction and land   consumer     business    total nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more  still accruing  total nonperforming loans      real estate owned     total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets for the years ended december  and  gross interest income which would have been recorded had the nonaccrual loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to thousand and thousand  respectively 
the amounts that were included in interest income on these loans were thousand and thousand for the years ended and  respectively 
while nonperforming loans increased million to million at december  compared to december   the increase was due to million of business loans past due days and still accruing 
these loans were days or more past maturity date but were current as to interest 
real estate owned decreased million for the same period to million at december  compared to a year earlier 
nonaccrual one to four family loans decreased thousand due to the decline in the number of nonperforming loans in this category 
most of the nonperforming loans in this category are individual loans with outstanding balances less than thousand 
nonaccrual commercial real estate loans decreased million due to decline in the number and size of loans in this category and related transfers to real estate owned during the year 
nonaccrual construction and land development loans increased million from to the reason for the increase in this category are three loans to one builder totaling million that were nonperforming at year end 
nonaccrual business loans decreased thousand in total nonperforming business loans are million or of that loan category 
unlike the real estate secured lending which comprises over of our loan portfolio  business loans often depend on the successful operation of the business or depreciable collateral 
therefore  we expect nonperforming loans and losses to be higher for business loans than for real estate loans 
we are aggressively pursuing collection of all nonperforming loans 
nonaccrual consumer loans have increased thousand to million at december  nonperforming consumer loans represent of the consumer portfolio 
the increase in these loans is primarily attributable to mobile home loans purchased prior to all consumer loans that are delinquent days or more are covered by loan insurance or included in the allowance for loan losses in an amount equal to the net book value for that loan 
in addition to the nonperforming assets included in the table above  we identify potential problem loans which are still performing but have a weakness which causes us to classify those loans as substandard for regulatory purposes 
there were of loans in this category at december  we monitor loans which exhibit some weakness but are not considered substandard for regulatory purposes 
these loans are described as special mention or watch loans 
at december   the bank had million of business loans to related borrowers which were classified as special mention loans 
subsequent to december   these loans became delinquent 
on march   based on financial projections provided by the borrower on march   these loans were put on nonaccrual  and were judged to be impaired 
management has estimated the impairment to be approximately million 
allowance for losses on loans 
the provision for loan losses and allowance for losses on loans is based on an analysis of individual loans  prior loss experience  growth in the loan portfolio  changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and other factors including current economic conditions 
the following table provides an analysis of the allowance for losses on loans at the dates indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period      charge offs one to four family multifamily commercial real estate consumer   business total charge offs    recoveries net charge offs    provision for loan losses      balance at end of period      net charge offs to average loans provision for loan losses to average loans allowance for losses on loans to total nonperforming loans at end of period allowance for losses on loans to total loans at end of period loans receivable increased in to billion while the allowance for losses on loans increased to million 
management increased the allowance due to the ongoing analysis of the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
we expect to continue to increase the allowance for loan losses when necessary as the loan portfolio continues to increase and the portfolio mix changes 
we considered the following factors in determining that this increased level of allowance for loan losses was adequate 
charge offs in were higher than in and at the highest level in our history 
total nonperforming loans at december  increased from a year earlier 
consumer loan charge offs continued to increase 
this increase was due primarily to acquisition of subprime and manufactured housing loans 
we are not currently increasing our portfolio in this lending area 
substantially all recoveries detailed above are in the consumer loan category 
we separately evaluated individual nonperforming loans for the adequacy of collateral values 
we consider several of these loans to be large because they each exceed million 
while in most instances  we were able to determine that our principal balance is well secured  we have provided specific allowances in those instances where it was deemed necessary 
we reached this determination by reviewing current or updated appraisals  brokers price opinions  and other market surveys 
the potential impact of an economic slowdown 
after careful consideration of all of these factors  we concluded that it was necessary to substantially increase the allowance for loan losses again in therefore  the provision for loan losses was increased to million in which resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to million 
comparison of december  and december  financial condition total assets amounted to billion at december  compared to billion at december  total assets increased million  or 
the increase in assets was funded primarily with increased borrowings of million and deposit growth of million 
securities available for sale increased by million to million at december  from million the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to our purchase of short term united states treasury securities used to meet regulatory liquidity requirements and other collateral maintenance requirements 
mortgage backed securities decreased million to million at december  from million a year earlier 
the primary reasons for the decrease were repayments of million and sales of million of mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable  including loans held for sale  increased million  or  to billion 
this increase was consistent with our overall strategy of increasing assets while adhering to prudent underwriting standards and preserving our capital status as adequately capitalized 
we experienced the following increases by loan category business loans million  consumer loans million  construction and land net of loans in process million  and commercial real estate loans million 
the decrease in one to four family loans of million was the result of the sale and securitization of this type of loan  especially in the latter part of the decrease in multifamily loans of million was primarily the result of loan repayments which more than offset the growth experienced in this category 
federal home loan bank fhlb stock increased to million at december  as compared to million at the prior year end 
the increase is the result of stock purchases of million  which are required by the fhlb as borrowings increase  and dividends of million 
premises and equipment increased million  or  to million 
this increase was the result of expenditures for construction costs for our new corporate headquarters and new retail sales offices  the purchase of computer equipment to accommodate continued growth  and loan production office expansion 
the new corporate headquarters was substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter  costs incurred for the new headquarters were million through december  we expect to spend additional amounts during for customized improvements for specific tenants 
we plan on opening an additional retail sales offices in loan servicing rights increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary reason for the increase was the purchase of loan servicing during the year along with the associated servicing rights  which had book value of approximately million 
this increase more than offset amortization of servicing rights of million 
accrued income  prepaid expenses and other assets decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the reason for the decrease was a decrease in accounts receivable related to the sale of loan servicing which took place in deposits totaled billion at december   an increase of million  or  from december  the increase resulted primarily from increased noninterest bearing checking accounts  interest bearing checking accounts  and certificates of deposit which were offset by decreased passbook savings and statement savings accounts 
borrowings increased million to million at december   from million at december  this increase was the result of increased use of federal home loan bank advances of million which was partially offset by a million decrease in reverse repurchase agreements and a million decrease in the commercial bank repurchase agreement 
the net increase in borrowings was due to the need to fund the asset growth discussed previously 
in the future  metropolitan will continue to monitor sources of borrowings for the most advantageous terms to fulfill its funding needs 
other liabilities increased to million at december  from million at the prior year end 
the increase was the result of greater clearing account  escrow account  and accounts payable balances 
shareholders equity increased million  or  to million  due largely to the retention of net income  the issuance of thousand shares of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan  and the decrease in the unrealized holding loss 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash for funding loan originations  loan purchases  deposit withdrawals  maturities of borrowings and operating expenses 
our primary sources of internally generated funds are principal repayments and payoffs of loans  cash flows from operations  and proceeds from sales of assets 
external sources of funds include increases in deposits and borrowings and public or private securities offerings by metropolitan 
in addition to debt or equity offerings  the primary source of funds for metropolitan  at the holding company level  is dividends from the bank 
the payment of these dividends is subject to restrictions imposed by federal bank regulatory agencies 
at december   metropolitan had liquid assets of million and had million available to borrow on its commercial bank line of credit 
currently  metropolitan primarily uses funds for tax payments  business expenses  and interest payments on its existing debt 
the covenants associated with its subordinated notes maturing january  require metropolitan to maintain liquid assets sufficient to pay six months interest  or approximately thousand 
metropolitan could also use funds for additional capital contributions to the bank  other operating expenses  purchase of investment securities  or the acquisition of other assets 
sources of funds for the bank such as loan repayments and deposit flows  are greatly influenced by prevailing interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
other sources of funds such as borrowings and maturities of securities are more reliable or predictable 
the bank currently has collateral pledged to the federal home loan bank sufficient to support borrowings of million 
as of december   the balance of fhlb borrowings was million 
we regularly review cash flow needs to fund operations 
we believe that the resources described above are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future 
at december   million  or of metropolitan s deposits were in the form of certificates of deposit of  and over 
another option we have considered and used in the past has been the acceptance of out of state time deposits from individuals and entities  primarily credit unions 
these deposits typically have balances of  to  and have a term of one year or more 
at december   approximately million of certificates of deposits  or of our total deposits  were held by these individuals and entities 
of these out of state time deposits  million are also included in the  and over time deposits discussed above 
during the third quarter of  the bank received regulatory approval and began accepting brokered deposits 
at december   brokered deposits totaled million all of which were included in the  and over time deposit discussed above 
the total of all certificates of deposit from brokers  out of state sources  and other certificates of deposit of  and over was at december   or of total deposits 
if we were unable to replace these deposits upon maturity  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we monitor these maturities to attempt to minimize any potential adverse effect on liquidity 
historically  the bank has been subject to a regulatory liquidity requirement 
these regulations require the bank to maintain liquid assets equal to at least of the bank s liquidity base on a quarterly basis 
liquid assets generally include all unpledged cash in banks  investment securities maturing within five years  and securities issued by the government national mortgage association  fanniemae  or freddiemac regardless of maturity 
the liquidity base includes amounts due banks and deposits and borrowings maturing in less than one year 
the bank s liquidity ratio for december was 
capital 
our total shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  or  from equity of million at december  this increase was due to net income of million  the issuance of  shares of common stock for thousand  and unrealized gains on securities available for sale  net of tax  of million 
no dividends were paid in  or the terms of our subordinated notes maturing january  and the commercial bank line of credit prohibit the payment of dividends unless tangible equity divided by total assets is greater than 
at december   metropolitan s tangible equity divided by total assets was 
in  metropolitan s wholly owned subsidiary  metropolitan capital trust ii  issued million of cumulative trust preferred securities 
similarly  in  metropolitan capital trust i  issued million of cumulative trust preferred securities 
sources of future capital could include  but would not be limited to  our earnings or additional offerings of debt or equity securities 
the office of thrift supervision imposes capital requirements on savings associations 
savings associations are required to meet three minimum capital standards 
these standards are a leverage requirement  a tangible capital requirement  and a risk based capital requirement 
these standards must be no less stringent than those applicable to national banks 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual associations on a case by case basis 
the office of thrift supervision leverage requirement expressly requires that savings associations maintain core capital in an amount not less than of adjusted total assets 
the office of thrift supervision has taken the position  however  that the prompt corrective action regulations have effectively raised the leverage ratio requirement for all but the most highly rated savings associations to 
core capital is defined to include shareholders equity less intangibles other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain qualifying intangibles  less investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for national banks 
under the tangible capital requirement  savings associations must maintain tangible capital in an amount equal to at least of adjusted total assets 
tangible capital is defined as core capital less all intangible assets  except a limited amount of qualifying purchased mortgage servicing rights 
adjusted total assets  for the purpose of the tangible capital ratio  include total assets less all intangible assets except qualifying purchased mortgage servicing rights 
the risk based capital requirement is calculated based on the risk weight assigned to on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments 
risk weights range from to of the book value of the asset and are based upon the risk inherent in the asset 
the risk weights assigned by the office of thrift supervision for principal categories of assets are for cash and securities issued by the us government or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  for securities  other than equity securities  issued by us government sponsored agencies  and for mortgage backed securities issued by  or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest  by fanniemae or freddiemac except for those classes with residual characteristics or stripped mortgage related securities  for the following loans prudently underwritten permanent one to four family first lien mortgage loans not more than days delinquent and having a loan to value ratio of not more than at origination unless insured to that ratio by an insurer approved by fanniemae or freddiemac  certain qualifying multifamily first lien mortgage loans  residential construction loans  and for all other loans and investments  including consumer loans  commercial loans  repossessed assets  and loans more than days delinquent 
the risk based requirement mandates total capital of of risk weighted assets 
total capital consists of core capital and supplementary capital 
supplementary capital consists of certain permanent and maturing capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital as well as general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk based requirement only to the extent of core capital 
the bank s regulatory capital ratios at december  were in excess of the capital requirements specified by the office of thrift supervision regulations as shown by the following table tangible core risk based capital capital capital dollars in thousands capital amount actual    required    excess    the bank is also subject to the capital adequacy requirements under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of the additional capital adequacy ratio imposed on the bank in this evaluation is the tier risk based capital ratio which at december  was compared to the required ratio of 
the bank s primary sources of capital are the earnings of the bank and additional capital investments from metropolitan 
at year end  the bank was adequately capitalized 
our strategy is to contribute additional capital to the bank as growth occurs to maintain risk based capital at adequately capitalized or well capitalized levels as defined by the office of thrift supervision regulations 
we believe that under current regulations  the bank will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  events beyond our control  such as increases in interest rates or a downturn in the economy  could adversely affect future earnings and  consequently  the ability of the bank to meet its future capital requirements

these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation and in monetary and fiscal policies 
our ability to match the interest rate sensitivity of our financial assets to the interest sensitivity of our financial liabilities in our asset liability management may tend to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on our financial performance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk metropolitan  like other financial institutions  is subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk that a company can suffer economic loss due to changes in the market values of various types of assets or liabilities 
as a financial institution  we make a profit by accepting and managing various types of risks 
the most significant of these risks are credit risk and interest rate risk 
see asset quality for a comprehensive discussion of credit risk 
the principal market risk for us is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will cause significant changes in net interest income because interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities mature at different intervals and reprice at different times 
the office of thrift supervision currently looks to thrift bulletin a  issued december   to evaluate interest rate risk at institutions they supervise 
they categorize interest rate risk as minimal  moderate  significant  or high based on a combination of the projected net portfolio value npv level after a basis point change in interest rates and the size of that change in npv due to a basis point change in interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk in a number of ways 
some of the tools used to monitor and quantify interest rate risk include annual budgeting process  quarterly forecasting process  monthly review of listing of liability rates and maturities by month  monthly shock report of effect of sudden interest rate changes on net interest income  monthly shock report of effect of sudden interest rate changes on net value of portfolio equity  monthly analysis of rate and volume changes in historic net interest income  weekly review of certificate of deposit offering rates and maturities by day  and weekly forecast of balance sheet activity 
we have established an asset and liability committee to monitor interest rate risk 
this committee is made up of senior officers from finance  lending and deposit operations 
the committee meets at least quarterly  reviews our current interest rate risk position  and determines strategies to pursue for the next quarter 
the activities of this committee are reported to the board of directors of the bank quarterly 
between meetings the members of this committee are involved in setting rates on deposits  setting rates on loans and serving on loan committees where they work on implementing the established strategies 
during and  like many financial institutions  we had exposure to potential declines in net interest income from rising interest rates 
this is because metropolitan has had more short term interest rate sensitive liabilities than short term interest rate sensitive assets 
one of the ways we monitor interest rate risk quantitatively is to measure the potential change in net interest income based on various immediate changes in market interest rates 
the following table shows the expected change in net interest income for immediate sustained parallel shifts of and in market interest rates as of the end of the last two years 
expected change in net interest income change in interest rate december  december  the change in net interest income from a change in market rates is a short term measure of interest rate risk 
the results above indicate that we have a significant short term exposure to rising rates and that the exposure has increased over the past year 
another quantitative measure of interest rate risk is the change in the market value of all financial assets and liabilities based on various immediate sustained shifts in market interest rates 
this concept is also known as net portfolio value and is the methodology used by the office of thrift supervision in measuring interest rate risk 
the following table shows the expected change in net portfolio value for immediate sustained parallel shifts of and in market interest rates as of the end of the last two years 
expected change in net portfolio value change in interest rate december  december  the change in net portfolio value is a long term measure of interest rate risk 
it assumes that no significant changes in assets or liabilities held would take place if there were a sudden change in interest rates 
because we monitor interest rate risk regularly and actively manage that risk  these projections serve as an expected worst case scenario assuming no reaction to changing rates 
the results above indicate that the post shock npv has declined during under tb a  metropolitan falls in the moderate interest rate risk category as of december   based upon current sensitivity to interest rate changes and the current level of regulatory capital 
our strategies to limit interest rate risk from rising interest rates are as follows originate one to four family loans primarily for sale  originate the majority of business loans to float with prime rates  increase core deposits which have low interest rate sensitivity  borrow funds with maturities greater than a year  borrow funds with maturities matched to new long term assets acquired  increase the volume of loans serviced since the value of that asset rises as rates rise  and consider the use of derivatives to reduce interest rate risk when economically practical 
we also follow strategies that increase interest rate risk in limited ways including originating and purchasing fixed rate multifamily and commercial real estate loans limited to five year maturities  and originating and purchasing fixed rate consumer loans with terms from two to fifteen years 
the result of these strategies taken together is that metropolitan has reduced long term interest rate risk by increasing borrowings due in more than one year to million at december  from million at december  during  we have strived to fund all significant additions of fixed rate assets with borrowings with similar repayment terms 
we plan to continue this funding pattern 
the bank s level of interest rate risk as of december   is outside the limits set by the bank s board of directors 
therefore  management has implemented a strategy to decrease interest rate risk during by focusing on limiting new five year fixed rate commercial real estate loans to those that can be readily sold  limiting the purchase of fixed rate consumer loans to those with high enough yields to be profitable when matched with similar borrowing maturities  and extending liability maturities when long term rates are favorable 
we are also aware that any method of measuring interest rate risk including the two used above has certain shortcomings 
for example  certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing dates but their repricing rates may not follow the general trend in market interest rates 
also  as a result of competition  the interest rates on certain assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates while rates on other assets and liabilities may lag market rates 
in addition  any projection of a change in market rates requires that prepayment rates on loans and early withdrawal of certificates of deposits be projected and those projections may be inaccurate 
we focus on the change in net interest income and the change in net portfolio value as a result of immediate and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates as a balanced approach to monitoring interest rate risk when used with budgeting and the other tools noted above 
at the present time we do not hold any trading positions  foreign currency positions  or commodity positions 
equity investments are approximately of assets and of that amount is held in federal home loan bank stock which can be sold to the federal home loan bank of cincinnati at par 
therefore  we do not consider any of these areas to be a source of significant market risk
