partially offsetting the increases were decreases in super dot costs  primarily specialist charges  due to a pricing change which eliminated nyse specialist charges for trades executed within minutes as compared to minutes in software royalties because software royalties are contractually fixed at of us posit revenues  the increase is wholly attributable to an increase in posit revenues 
occupancy and equipment the increase in headcount and infrastructure enhancements resulted in increased equipment purchases and the associated depreciation and maintenance expenses 
in addition  rent expense increased due to the expansion of our research and development facility in culver city  california  and our new york headquarters  as well as the opening of additional offices during in toronto  canada and waltham  massachusetts 
telecommunications and data processing services increases in our client base and employee base resulted in additional client data services  including market data line connections  increased communication charges to link clients to itg in new york and boston  and for infrastructure improvements to accommodate volume growth and the expected move to decimalization 
telecommunications and data processing services as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to in from in net loss on long term investments the increase in loss on long term investments in over primarily resulted from the recorded losses incurred by our european joint venture  a  loss from our vostock joint venture with wit soundview and the effect of the deferred gain on the sale of the longview group  realized in  after having been held in escrow for one year 
other general and administrative the increase in other general and administrative expenses reflects an increase in legal  accounting and consulting professional fees along with increased spending on business development 
these expenses were partially offset by lower software amortization for certain products that were released in late  which had increased the related expense in income tax expense the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in was due to decreases in state and local income taxes partially offset by higher nondeductible foreign losses in year ended december  compared to year ended december  earnings per share basic net earnings per share for both and were

electronic trading desk revenues decreased due to a number of factors  including  our clients winning fewer portfolio transitions  increased competition from principal bids and lower turnover of portfolios for some of our clients 
as a result  share volumes decreased by million or from billion in to billion in other revenues increased primarily due to incremental royalty income from international versions of posit  larger average balances in our investment portfolio and decreased errors and accommodations 
these were partially offset by increased financing costs resulting from temporary positions in securities assumed in the normal course of our agency trading business

the following table itemizes expenses by category in thousands year ended december  change change compensation and employee benefits   transaction processing    software royalties    occupancy and equipment    telecommunications and data processing services    net loss on long term investments    spin off costs    other general and administrative   income taxes   compensation and employee benefits salaries  bonuses and related employee benefits increased primarily due to growth in our employee base of from to  and payment of additional compensation necessary to attract and retain quality personnel 
approximately of the increase in employees were staffed in technology  product development and production infrastructure 
this is consistent with our ongoing effort to respond to continuous changes in the securities industry and demand for increased efficiencies by enhancing existing software and developing new software and services 
average compensation and employee benefits expenses per average headcount decreased  or  from  to  transaction processing transaction processing as a percentage of revenues increased from to of revenues 
ticket charges increased  primarily as a result of customers allocating transactions to a larger number of accounts 
with only a increase in execution volume  we did not realize significant savings from volume discounted clearing and execution costs 
software royalties because software royalties are contractually fixed at of us posit revenues  the increase is wholly attributable to an increase in posit revenues 
occupancy and equipment the increase in headcount  infrastructure enhancements and costs to address potential problems related to the year issue resulted in increased equipment purchases and the associated depreciation and maintenance expenses 
in addition  the expansion of our research and development facility in culver city  california  in july resulted in an increase in rent expense 
telecommunications and data processing services the million increase in telecommunications and data processing services stems primarily from fees to upgrade client data feeds  including market data line connections  increase in communication charges from linking clients to itg in new york and boston  and increases in dial up costs related to the increase in itg platform installations 
this increase was offset primarily by a decrease in spending on contingency related planning and implementation 
net loss on long term investments the increase in loss on long term investments in over primarily resulted from the recorded gain on sale of our equity investment in the longview group  inc in totaling million 
excluding the effects of this gain on sale  losses incurred by our investments in itg europe and itg australia were million less in than in  we also recognized a million deferred gain on the sale of the longview group that was held in escrow for one year 
spin off costs the spin off expenses are attributable to our legal  accounting  consulting and other expenses incurred for the spin off transactions  as discussed in note  organization and basis of presentation spin off from jefferies group  in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page other general and administrative the increase in other general and administrative expenses reflects software amortization for certain products that were released in late and increased spending on advertisement and promotion  offset in part by a decline in consulting expenses for projects such as network migration and strategic market studies 
additionally  subsequent to our spin off  specified administrative services previously provided to us at a fixed monthly fee by jefferies group were performed by itg 
this change resulted in higher legal  audit and accounting fees offset in part by reduced administrative service fees 
income tax expense the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in was due to decreases in certain non deductible expenses and an increase in dividends received deduction 
dependence on major customers during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenue 
during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue 
during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue 
customers may discontinue use of our services at any time 
the loss of any significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers could result in lower share volumes of securities submitted to posit  which may adversely affect the liquidity of the system 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resource requirements result from our working capital needs  primarily consisting of compensation and benefits  transaction processing fees and software royalty fees 
historically  cash from operations has met all working capital requirements 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds and other short term investments that generally mature within days or less 
additionally  securities owned at fair value include highly liquid  variable rate municipal securities  auction rate preferred stock  common stock and convertible debt securities 
at december   cash equivalents and securities owned at fair value amounted to million and net receivables from brokers  dealers and other  of million were due within days 
a special cash dividend of million was paid on april  in connection with the spin off from jefferies group 
see note  organization and basis of presentation spin off from jefferies group  in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page we also invest a portion of our excess cash balances in cash enhanced strategies  which we believe should yield higher returns without any significant effect on risk 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships investing in marketable securities  a hedged convertible managed account  and a venture capital fund amounting to million in the aggregate 
the limited partnerships employ either a hedged convertible strategy or a long short strategy to capitalize on short term price movements 
our managed account is employing a hedged convertible strategy 
we classify the securities under our managed account within securities owned  at fair value and securities sold  not yet purchased  at fair value 
historically  all regulatory capital needs of itg inc and alternet securities  inc have been provided by cash from operations 
we believe that cash flows from operations will provide itg inc and alternet securities  inc 
with sufficient regulatory capital 
as of december   itg inc and alternet securities  inc  had net excess regulatory capital of million and million  respectively 
although we believe that the combination of our existing net regulatory capital and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet regulatory capital requirements  a shortfall in net regulatory capital would have a material adverse effect on us 
effects of inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in north america in recent years have had a significant effect on our revenue or profitability 
however  high inflation may lead to higher interest rates which might cause investment funds to move from equity securities to debt securities or cash equivalents 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market price risk as part of our company s full service equity trade execution business we do not engage in proprietary trading  however  at times we do hold positions overnight due to client or company errors 
accordingly  we maintain policies and procedures regarding the management of our errors and accommodations proprietary trading accounts 
it is our policy to attempt to trade out of all positions arising from errors and accommodations immediately while balancing our exposure to market risk which can arise from liquidating such positions 
accordingly  certain positions may be liquidated over a period of time in an effort to minimize market impact 
we have established approval policies that include review by the president or his designee and our compliance department of any proprietary trading activity 
our operations department reviews all open trades intraday in an effort to ensure that any open issues are addressed and resolved by the close of the trading day 
additionally  our clearing broker notifies us of all known trade discrepancies on the day following the trade date 
we employ a cash management strategy which seeks to optimize excess liquid assets by preserving principal  maintaining liquidity to satisfy capital requirements  minimizing risk and maximizing our after tax rate of return 
for working capital purposes  we invest only in money market instruments 
cash which is not needed for normal operations is invested in a tax efficient manner in instruments with appropriate maturities and levels of risk to correspond to expected liquidity needs 
we currently have investments in municipal bonds  auction rate preferred bonds  common stock and convertible bonds 
to the extent that we invest in marketable equity securities  we ensure portfolio liquidity by investing in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
a portion of the investments under our cash management strategy are managed by inference group llc  our internal asset management subsidiary  which conducts its day to day trading activities in accordance with investment strategies reviewed with senior management and is subject to oversight by our chief financial officer 
at december  our cash and cash equivalents and securities owned were approximately million 
we will from time to time  make investments that are considered strategic 
these investments require approval of executive management and or the board of directors 
this component of our cash management strategy is reevaluated periodically 
at december   investments in limited partnerships investing in marketable securities  a hedged convertible managed account and a venture capital fund were approximately million 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the interest bearing portions of our investment portfolio 
our policy is to invest in high quality credit issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and invest in tax efficient strategies 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to reductions in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor that we believe is adverse to our investment strategy 
our interest bearing investment portfolio primarily consists of short term  high credit quality money market funds  highly liquid variable rate municipal securities  convertible bonds and preferred stock 
these investments totaled approximately million at december  our interest bearing investments are not insured and because of the short term high quality nature of the investments are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
foreign currency risk we are pursuing the international market in a variety of ways  including our joint venture in europe and our operations in canada and australia and through the development of specially tailored versions of our services 
additionally  we maintain development facilities in israel which focus on developing services for the european market 
our investments and development activities in these countries expose us to currency exchange fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  australian dollar  canadian dollar  euro and israeli new shekel 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities 
however  non us dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs
