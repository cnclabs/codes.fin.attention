corporate strategy as we enter our nd year  market making remains the core of our business 
consistent with the past  our goal is to enhance our historic strengths while expanding our product base and capabilities 
we plan to do this by o combining sophisticated training with the latest electronic trading and information technology 
we have increased our trading platform and access to markets and information to meet the new trading demands 
we have  among other things  linked a number of automated trading systems to our arsenal 
o our investment banking activities are being expanded to cover raising private placement or other funding for small but dynamically expanding entities  while sometimes investing in these operations to secure a minority position in the shareholdings for our firm 
analyzing the needs of clients involved in these fields so that we may advise them in acquiring other operations or expanding their activities to encompass other related businesses  which utilize the same basic technology and skills 
o strategic alliances with other institutions since we view the securities industry and financial industries in general as involved in a vast expansionist phase both horizontally by taking on a variety of banking  financial and securities products and vertically by linking up european  far eastern and american firms we intend to explore these possibilities for ourselves as well 
we will do this so that we are able to offer our retail and institutional clients a wider variety of products  we gain access to other products and overseas markets for our customers  we are able to make available to overseas parties the ability to gain access to us securities markets and financial products 
in this way  we seek to add value for our stockholders  provide greater services for our clients  and participate in the product and global expansionist surge of securities and financial firms 
the movement to greater communications resources and electronic commerce  through the internet and otherwise  has accelerated these trends 
we intend to participate  but only after carefully examining the risks and potential rewards involved so that we are not exposing ourselves to significantly greater financial risk in the implementation of our strategic plans 
we also will move forward only if we are able to assure ourselves and our clients of being able to continue to provide at least the same personalized and professional servicing of their financial needs and accounts that we have historically provided to them 
operations we do not hold client funds or securities and do not directly process back office operations 
we clear most transactions for our institutional clients and all transactions for our own proprietary trading accounts  with spear  leeds kellogg  inc  members of the new york stock exchange and other principal stock exchanges 
we clear all transactions for our retail customers with investec ernst securities corp 
all clearing activities are carried on a fully disclosed basis with our customers 
these clearing services are furnished to us and our clients for a fee and include billing  custody of securities  credit review including for margin accounts and similar activities 
however  if our customers do not pay or deliver securities for a trade or if they do not properly maintain their credit balances on margin accounts  and there is a loss for which we cannot collect from our customer  we are generally liable for such losses 
we maintain our back office and compliance divisions to supervise our activities generally and to ensure financial and regulatory compliance with applicable rules 
vendors we employ a multitude of third party vendors which supply us with information services and software  including stock quotations  stock trading charts  news and financial data 
we have alternate sources for these services and  accordingly  do not consider ourselves dependent on any one or more of these suppliers 
competition the securities industry is very competitive and  with technical innovation  is becoming even more so 
accordingly  we seek to compete  based upon our traditional strengths built up on an over forty year period of time o quality o efficiency o training o reliability of our trading abilities o our reputation in the markets and with other market professionals o relationships with our institutional and retail clients o our skilled and experienced management team o research data we also utilize what we consider the best and most reliable of technological advances in order to compete and continually enhance the quality of services provided 
we are competing with a galaxy of large and small brokerage firms which utilize both traditional methods and electronic commerce to transact their business 
we encounter intense competition in all aspects of the securities business and compete directly with other securities firms  a significant number of which have substantially greater capital and other resources 
many of these competitors now offer a wider range of financial services although our strategy is to bridge this gap by broadening our product line 
in addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business there has recently been increasing competition from other sources such as commercial banks and insurance companies offering financial services 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the securities industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel and relative prices of services and products offered 
we and our competitors also directly solicit potential customers and furnish investment research publications to investors in an effort to hold and attract existing and potential clients 
government regulation the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
we are registered as a broker dealer with the sec 
much of the regulation of broker dealers has been delegated to self regulated organizations  principally the nasd and national securities exchanges such as nasdaq 
these self regulatory organizations adopt rules subject to approval by the sec that govern the industry and conduct periodic examinations of our operations 
securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business 
regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of clients participating in those markets  but not with protecting the interests of our stockholders 
broker dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business  including sales methods  trade practices among broker dealers  use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities  capital structure  record keeping and the conduct of directors  officers and employees 
net capital requirements the sec  nasd and various other regulatory agencies have rigid rules requiring the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities brokers  including the sec s uniform net capital rule which we must comply with 
net capital is defined as assets minus liabilities plus other allowable credits and qualifying subordinated borrowings less mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from valuing other assets  such as a firm s positions in securities  on a stringent basis 
among these deductions are adjustments in the market value of securities to reflect the possibility of a market decline prior to disposition 
as of january   we were required to maintain minimum net capital  in accordance with sec rules  of  and had total net capital of approximately  or approximately  in excess of our minimum net capital requirements 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital we may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec and suspension or expulsion by the nasd and other regulatory bodies 
in addition  a change in the net capital rules  the imposition of new rules  a specific operating loss  or any unusually large charge against net capital could limit our operations that require the intensive use of capital and could limit our ability to expand our business 
the net capital rules also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital  which could limit our ability to pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase shares of our outstanding stock 
personnel as of march   we employed a total of full time persons  whose primary roles are trading  retail representatives  back office personnel  bonds and fixed income  investment banking  institutional research  compliance  accounting  retail clerical  and in executive management 
our relations with our employees are generally good and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions 
our registered representatives are required to take examinations administered by the nasd and state authorities in order to be qualified to transact business 
our success will depend on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified trading  technical and financial personnel  who are generally in high demand

the automated trading system also alerts management to any trades which exceed certain parameters as to position or trade size during the day 
in the course of our business  we maintain inventory  consisting mainly of nasdaq and otc securities and municipal bonds 
the market value of our inventory at january  was million in long positions and million in short positions
