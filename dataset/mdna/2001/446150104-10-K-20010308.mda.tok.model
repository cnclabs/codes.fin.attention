lines of business retail banking  corporate banking  dealer sales  and the private financial group are the company s major business lines 
a fifth segment includes the impact of huntington s treasury function and other unallocated assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense 
line of business results are determined based upon huntington s business profitability reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments 
this process is designed around huntington s organizational and management structure and  accordingly  the results are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions 
below is a brief description of each line of business and a discussion of the business segment results  which can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
retail banking retail banking provides products and services to retail and business banking customers 
this business unit s products include home equity loans  first mortgage loans  installment loans  business loans  personal and business deposit products  as well as investment and insurance services 
these products and services are offered through huntington s traditional banking network  in store branches  direct bank  and web bank 
retail banking net income totaled million in compared with million in and million in excluding the revenue and expenses related to the credit card portfolio that was sold in last year s fourth quarter  the and earnings were million and million  respectively 
on this basis  retail s net income increased from this increase was achieved despite a decline in net interest income due to higher deposit costs and a million increase in the provision for loan losses 
non interest income for the year was relatively unchanged versus  as a increase in service charges and a increase in electronic banking fees was offset by a significant decline in mortgage banking revenue 
mortgage loan originations were adversely impacted by higher market interest rates throughout much of non interest expense improved from last year 
the retail segment contributed of huntington s operating earnings and comprised of its total loan portfolio and of its total core deposits 
corporate banking this segment represents the middle market and large corporate banking customers  which use a variety of products and services including  but not limited to  commercial loans  asset based financing  international trade  and cash management 
huntington s capital markets division also provides alternative financing solutions for larger business clients  including privately placed debt  syndicated commercial lending  and the sale of interest rate protection products 
corporate banking reported net income of million for versus million and million for the previous two years 
net interest income increased in driven by loan growth 
the increase in non interest income was due in large part to increases in service charges 
non interest expenses increased in due to investments in personnel and technology to support revenue growth initiatives 
corporate banking contributed of huntington s operating earnings  and represented of the total loan portfolio and of its total core deposits 
dealer sales dealer sales product offerings pertain to the automobile lending sector and include floor plan financing  as well as indirect consumer loans and leases 
the consumer activities comprise the vast majority of the business and involve the financing of vehicles purchased or leased by individuals through dealerships 
net income for this segment totaled million  million  and million in each of the last three years 
dealer sales results reflect the impact of after tax charges of million in and million in to write down vehicle lease residual values 
excluding these charges  net income was million for  compared with million for  and million for net interest income was relatively unchanged due to billion of loan securitization activity in the recent year 
the increase from in the provision for loan losses of million reflects higher net charge offs of  versus 
in and 
in non interest income improved million including million of revenue from the securitizations completed in dealer sales comprised of huntington s operating earnings in and of its outstanding loans 
private financial group huntington s private financial group pfg provides an array of products and services including personal trust  asset management  investment advisory  insurance  and deposit and loan products 
the pfg business line is designed to provide higher wealth customers with one stop shopping for all their financial needs 
pfg reported net income of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
non interest income increased in the recent twelve months due to higher trust and brokerage and insurance income aided in part by the acquisition of jrd 
related increases in sales commissions contributed to higher non interest expense and reflect the impact of jrd as well 
this segment represented of huntington s operating earnings and of total loans 
treasury other huntington uses a match funded transfer pricing system to allocate interest income and interest expense to its business segments 
this approach consolidates the interest rate risk management of huntington into its treasury group 
as part of its overall interest rate risk and liquidity management strategy  the treasury group administers an investment portfolio of approximately billion 
revenue and expense associated with these activities remain within the treasury group 
additionally  the treasury other segment absorbs unassigned assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  and expense that cannot be directly assigned or allocated to one of huntington s lines of business 
amortization expense of intangible assets is a significant component of treasury other 
treasury other segment results include special charges of million in and million in the results also include the gain from the credit card sale of million 
on an operating basis  this segment reported a loss of million for  versus net income of million in  and million in the decline relates to lower net interest income resulting from rising market interest rates and the balance sheet efficiency program mentioned earlier 
as more fully discussed later  the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates is down from previous years  consistent with huntington s goal of a more stable revenue base 
non interest income includes securities gains realized in from the sale of equity investments  offset by losses recognized from the sale of lower yielding investment securities and the first quarter automobile loan securitization

calculated assuming a tax rate 
results of operations net interest income net interest income was million in  versus  million in  and  million in the net interest margin  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was during the recent year  compared with and during each of the last two years 
higher funding costs due to rising interest rates and changes in the mix of huntington s core deposit base were the primary driver of these declines 
funding costs increased basis points from while the yield on earning assets was up only basis points 
core deposit costs increased basis points  as the mix shifted to higher rate accounts during the year 
this migration accelerated in following the introduction of new products designed to improve customer retention in the intensely competitive market for retail deposits 
to a lesser degree  the reduction in net interest income and the margin also reflects the impact of the fourth quarter credit card sale and the automobile loan securitizations in huntington s interest rate risk position is further discussed in the interest rate risk management section of this report 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the charge to pre tax earnings necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses all at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was million in versus million and million in the past two years

net charge offs as a percent of average loans totaled 
for both and and were 
in consistent with broader industry trends  huntington s charge offs increased in the second half of and were 
in the fourth quarter 
net change offs are expected to be above these recent levels in huntington allocates the all to each loan category based on a detailed credit quality review performed periodically on specific commercial loans based on size and relative risk and other relevant factors such as portfolio performance  internal controls  and impacts from mergers and acquisitions 
loss factors are applied on larger  commercial and industrial and commercial real estate credits and represent management s estimate of the inherent loss 
the portion of the allowance allocated to homogeneous consumer loans is determined by applying projected loss ratios to various segments of the loan portfolio giving consideration to existing economic conditions and trends 
projected loss ratios incorporate factors such as trends in past due and non accrual amounts  recent loan loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics  and concentrations of various loan categories 
actual loss ratios experienced in the future  however  could vary from those projected because a loan s performance depends not only on economic factors but also other factors unique to each customer 
the diversity in size of corporate commercial loans can be significant as well and even if the projected number of loans deteriorates  the dollar exposure could significantly vary from estimated amounts 
additionally  the impact on individual customers from recent economic events may yet be known 
to ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence  a portion of the all is considered unallocated 
for analytical purposes  the allocation of the all is provided in table while amounts are allocated to various portfolio segments  the total all  excluding impairment reserves prescribed under provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the all was million at december   and million at year end  representing of total loans at both dates

brokerage and insurance income grew during due to strong mutual fund and annuity sales  primarily during the first half of the year  and the jrd acquisition 
electronic banking fees grew as a result of higher customer usage of huntington s check card product and the expansion of huntington s atm network 
the other component of non interest revenue includes million of income from the automobile loan securitization transactions completed in investment security gains totaled million for  compared with million a year ago and million in sales by huntington of certain equity investments generated gross gains of million in and million last year 
substantially offsetting these gains in both years were losses from the sale of lower yielding  fixed income investment securities 
non interest expense non interest expense  before special charges  was million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
higher facility and equipment costs related to the new operations center  which opened in the fall of  and other expansion related activities contributed to the growth in expenses in the recent year 
additionally  expenses were higher in the second half of  as huntington made investments in technology and personnel and acquired empire and jrd to improve its competitive position and to support revenue growth 
because of the above mentioned factors  management expects that non interest expense in will increase from the th quarter level 
special charges huntington recorded special charges totaling million in the recent year  million in  and million in the million charge in and million of the charge represent write downs of residual values related to huntington s billion vehicle lease portfolio 
of the million total charge  million remained available at december   to cover estimated losses inherent in the portfolio 
based on management s projections  the remaining amount is adequate to absorb the estimated impairment losses in the portfolio at december  additionally  huntington has taken actions  including no longer capitalizing the value of customer added options  that are expected to mitigate residual value exposure on new business 
the charge also included million related to the company s huntington program as well as other one time expenses  which included amounts paid for management consulting and other professional services as well as million for a special cash award to employees for achievement of the program goals for huntington was a collaborative effort among all employees to evaluate processes and procedures and the way huntington conducts its business with a mission of maximizing efficiency through all aspects of the organization 
the charge related to costs for several strategic actions that enhanced profitability  including the sale or closure of underperforming banking offices and the termination of certain business activities 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million  million  and million in each of the last three years

interest rate risk and liquidity management interest rate risk management huntington seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility arising from shifts in interest rates 
the asset and liability management committee alco oversees financial risk management  establishing broad policies and specific operating limits that govern a variety of financial risks inherent in huntington s operations  including interest rate  liquidity  counterparty  settlement  and market risks

weighted average yields were calculated on the basis of amortized cost 
marketable equity securities are excluded 
and off balance sheet strategies and tactics are reviewed and monitored regularly by alco to ensure consistency with approved risk tolerances 
interest rate risk management is a dynamic process  encompassing business flows onto the balance sheet  wholesale investment and funding  and the changing market and business environment 
effective management of interest rate risk begins with appropriately diversified investments and funding sources 
to accomplish its overall balance sheet objectives  huntington regularly accesses a variety of global markets money  bond  futures  and options as well as numerous trading exchanges 
in addition  dealers in over the counter financial instruments provide availability of interest rate swaps as needed 
measurement and monitoring of interest rate risk is an ongoing process 
a key element in this process is huntington s estimation of the amount that net interest income will change over a twelve month period given a gradual and directional shift in interest rates 
the income simulation model used by huntington captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on mortgages and consumer installment loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization on revolving credit instruments  and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  eg interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships  as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
while these assumptions are inherently uncertain  management assigns probabilities and  therefore  believes at any point in time that the model provides a reasonably accurate estimate of huntington s interest rate risk exposure 
management reporting of this information is regularly shared with the board of directors 
at december   the results of huntington s sensitivity analysis indicated that net interest income would be expected to decline by approximately  if rates rose basis points and would drop an estimated  in the event of a gradual basis point increase 
if rates declined and basis points  huntington s net interest income would benefit or  respectively 
huntington s recent analysis shows a meaningful reduction in sensitivity to changing interest rates compared with year end  in which the risk to net interest income of a basis point increase was 
this reduction is indicative of the balance sheet efficiency efforts described previously 
active interest rate risk management necessitates the use of various types of off balance sheet financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
risk that is created by different indices on products  by unequal terms to maturity of assets and liabilities  and by products that are appealing to customers but incompatible with current risk limits can be eliminated or decreased in a cost efficient manner by utilizing interest rate swaps 
often  the swap strategy has enabled huntington to lower the overall cost of raising wholesale funds 
similarly  financial futures  interest rate caps and floors  options  and forward rate agreements are used to control financial risk effectively 
off balance sheet instruments are often preferable to similar cash instruments because  though performing identically  they require less capital while preserving access to the marketplace 
table illustrates the approximate market values  estimated maturities and weighted average rates of the interest rate swaps used by huntington in its interest rate risk management program at december  as is the case with cash securities  the market value of interest rate swaps is largely a function of the financial market s expectations regarding the future direction of interest rates 
accordingly  current market values are not necessarily table interest rate swap portfolio at december  asset conversion swaps liability conversion swaps basis receive pay receive pay protection in millions of dollars fixed fixed total fixed fixed total swaps notional value      average maturity years market value average rate receive pay indicative of the future impact of the swaps on net interest income 
this will depend  in large part  on the shape of the yield curve as well as interest rate levels 
with respect to the variable rate information presented in table  management made no assumptions regarding future changes in interest rates 
the pay rates on huntington s receive fixed swaps vary based on movements in the applicable london interbank offered rate libor 
receive fixed asset conversion swaps with notional values of million have embedded written libor based call options 
basis swaps are contracts that provide for both parties to receive interest payments according to different rate indices and are used to protect against changes in spreads between market rates 
the contractual amounts of interest payments to be exchanged are based on the notional values of the swap portfolio 
these notional values do not represent direct credit exposures 
at december   huntington s credit risk from interest rate swaps used for asset liability management purposes was million  which represents the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to huntington  including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties 
in order to minimize the risk that a swap counterparty will not satisfy its interest payment obligation under the terms of the contract  huntington performs credit reviews on all counterparties  restricts the number of counterparties used to a select group of high quality institutions  obtains collateral  and enters into formal netting arrangements 
huntington has never experienced any past due amounts from a swap counterparty and does not anticipate nonperformance in the future by any such counterparties 
at december   the total notional amount of off balance sheet instruments used by huntington on behalf of customers for which the related interest rate risk is offset by third party contracts was billion 
the credit exposure from these contracts is not material and furthermore  these separate activities  which are accounted for at fair value  are not a significant part of huntington s operations 
accordingly  they have been excluded from the above discussion of off balance sheet financial instruments and the related table 
liquidity management liquidity management is also a significant responsibility of alco 
the objective of alco in this regard is to maintain an optimum balance of maturities among huntington s assets and liabilities such that sufficient cash  or access to cash  is available at all times to meet the needs of borrowers  depositors  and creditors  as well as to fund corporate expansion and other activities 
a chief source of huntington s liquidity is derived from the large retail deposit base accessible by its network of geographically dispersed banking offices 
this core funding is supplemented by huntington s demonstrated ability to raise funds in capital markets and to access funds nationwide 
the bank subsidiary s billion domestic bank note and billion european bank note programs along with a similar million note program at the parent company are significant sources of wholesale funding 
under these programs unsecured senior and subordinated notes are issuable with maturities ranging from one month to thirty years 
the proceeds from the parent s note program are used from time to time to fund certain non banking activities  finance acquisitions  repurchase huntington s common stock  or for other general corporate purposes 
at december   approximately billion of notes were available under these programs to fund huntington s future activities 
huntington also has million of capital securities outstanding through its subsidiaries  huntington capital i and ii 
a million line of credit is also available to the parent holding company to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term working capital needs 
while liability sources are many  significant liquidity is also available from huntington s investment and loan portfolios 
alco regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the business and ensures that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events 
at the end of the recent year  management believes sufficient liquidity was available to meet estimated short term and long term funding needs

the credit administration function employs extensive risk management techniques  including forecasting  to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified 
these procedures provide executive management with the information necessary to implement policy adjustments where necessary  and take corrective actions on a proactive basis 
non performing assets npas consist of loans that are no longer accruing interest  loans that have been renegotiated based upon financial difficulties of the borrower  and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
commercial and real estate loans are placed on non accrual status and stop accruing interest when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or generally when the loan is days past due 
when interest accruals are suspended  accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss 
consumer loans are not placed on non accrual status  rather they are charged off in accordance with regulatory statutes  which is generally no more than days 
a charge off may be delayed in circumstances when collateral is repossessed and anticipated to be sold at a future date 
total npas were million at december   compared with million at year end as of the same dates  npas as a percent of total loans and other real estate were 
and 
total npas are expected to increase further in as deteriorating economic conditions adversely impact corporate borrowers 
loans past due ninety days or more but continuing to accrue interest increased to million at december   versus million last year 
this increase was approximately evenly distributed between commercial and consumer lending 
capital and dividends huntington places significant emphasis on the maintenance of strong capital  which promotes investor confidence  provides access to the national markets under favorable terms  and enhances business growth and acquisition opportunities 
huntington also recognizes the importance of managing capital and continually strives to maintain an appropriate balance between capital adequacy and returns to shareholders 
capital is managed at each subsidiary based upon the respective risks and growth opportunities  as well as regulatory requirements 
average shareholders equity was billion for the year ended december   compared with billion last year 
huntington s ratio of average equity to average assets in the recent year was versus one year ago 
on a period end basis  the ratios were and 
excluding the unrealized losses on securities available for sale  tangible equity to assets was and at the two recent year ends 
risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve board set minimum capital requirements and require institutions to calculate risk based capital ratios by assigning risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items  such as interest rate swaps  loan commitments  and securitizations 
these guidelines further define well capitalized levels for tier  total capital  and leverage ratio purposes at   and  respectively 
at december   huntington s tier risk based capital ratio was  total risk based capital ratio was  and the leverage ratio was 
huntington s bank subsidiary also had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well capitalized institutions
