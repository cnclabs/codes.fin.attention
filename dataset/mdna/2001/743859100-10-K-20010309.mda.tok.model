net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was 
in compared to 
in non accrual loans ended the year at million or 
of loans outstanding  a decrease of million from december  this decrease is due to the write down of the above mentioned health care loan

financial condition source and use of funds deposits a major portion of the bank s funding comes from core deposits  which consist of consumer and commercial transaction accounts and consumer savings and time deposits 
these deposits are generated through the bank s branch banking locations 
at december   core deposits represented of total deposits and of total liabilities 
future funding growth is expected to be generated from deposit growth through strategies outlined below 
the branch network strategy includes traditional full service branch locations and in store branches 
in store branch locations are comprised of supermarket locations and national retail superstores 
provident bank  as of december   had traditional branch locations and in store branches 
the bank has an agreement with supervalu to operate branches in their metro and basic supermarkets in the baltimore metropolitan area and shoppers food warehouse in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
additional branch opportunities complementary to existing locations will be sought when the cost of entry is reasonable 
the bank has nine additional branches planned for the bank continues to attract increased commercial and retail deposits 
interest bearing demand money market deposit balances at december  were up million  or  compared to year end the bank decided to sell its check cashing facilities during the second quarter of and closed that transaction during the third quarter of the table below presents the average deposit balances and rates paid for the five years ended december  average deposits table average average average average average average average average average average dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate balance rate balance rate noninterest bearing      money market demand      savings      time certificates of deposit      individual retirement accounts      total average balance rate      total year end balance      as the table above indicates  the bank has a stable base of consumer savings deposits 
during  average deposits grew million  or  compared to average money market demand deposits and non interest bearing deposits increased million or 
this growth reflects an emphasis on full banking relationships with retail and commercial customers 
average time deposits increased million  or  million of which is attributable to brokered deposits 
brokered deposits  often a cheaper source of funds compared to other available sources of borrowed money  such as federal home loan bank advances and repurchase agreements  are used to match fund investments and acquired loans 
the table below presents information at december   with respect to the maturity of certificates of deposit of  or more 
deposit maturities table maturities over three over six three months months to months to over dollars in thousands or less six months months months total balance      percent of total credit risk management much of the fundamental business of provident is based upon understanding  measuring and controlling credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risks  which are inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit loss 
for example  loans with generally low credit loss experience include home mortgage and home equity loans 
loans with medium credit loss experience are primarily secured products such as auto and marine loans 
the category with high credit loss experience includes unsecured products such as personal revolving credit 
in commercial lending  losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can vary widely from period to period and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
the evaluation of specific risk is a basic function of underwriting and loan administration  involving analysis of the borrower s ability to service debt as well as the value of pledged collateral 
policies and procedures have been developed which specify the appropriate credit approval and monitoring for the various types of credit offered 
the bank employs prudent lending practices and adheres to regulatory requirements including loan to value ratios and legal lending limits 
these procedures are modified periodically in order to reflect changing conditions and new products 
the bank s lending and loan administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio  credit risk identification and review processes are utilized 
credit risk analysis assigns a grade to each commercial loan based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
an independent loan review function tests risk assessments and determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
financial accounting standards require creditors to evaluate the collectibility of contractually due principal and interest on commercial credits to assess the need for providing for losses 
the corporation s credit procedures require monitoring of commercial credits to determine the collectibility of such credits 
if a loan is identified as impaired  it will be placed on non accrual status and recorded according to accounting guidelines 
as of december   there were million in commercial loans considered to be impaired 
loans the bank offers a diversified mix of residential and commercial real estate  business and consumer loans 
as shown in table  the mix of loans outstanding is heavily consumer oriented 
of the total loans  billion  or  are secured by residential real estate including first and second mortgages  and home equity loans 
during the fourth quarter of  the bank made a decision to reposition its mortgage operations by offering mortgages to its retail customers through an outsourced loan origination process and no longer will seek loan production from realtors and brokers 
as a result  the mortgage lending operations of its subsidiary  provident mortgage corp  are being phased out 
prior to this decision  residential mortgage lending included the origination  sale and servicing of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans 
loans were originated through the loan production offices of provident mortgage corp 
mortgage origination activity in was million compared to million in during  income from the sale of loans was million 
the mortgage servicing portfolio ended the year at million 
the residential real estate mortgage loan balance at december  was million compared to million at the end of the prior year 
the following table sets forth information concerning the bank s loan portfolio by type of loan at december loan portfolio summary table dollars in thousands consumer      commercial business      real estate construction residential      commercial     
 
real estate mortgage residential      commercial      total loans      the bank offers a wide range of loans to consumers including installment loans  home equity loans  and personal lines of credit 
in addition  the bank may purchase portfolios of quality consumer loans from other financial institutions 
all purchased portfolios go through a thorough due diligence process prior to a purchase commitment 
the portfolio of acquired loans decreased million on average  ending the year at billion  and was predominately comprised of second mortgages 
the bank securitized million of acquired second mortgage loans during the third quarter of and retained the securities in the investment portfolio 
average consumer loan balances through credits originated remained relatively flat during the year  ending the year with a balance of million 
during  the bank made a decision to exit both indirect auto and residential mortgage lending to concentrate on more profitable businesses 
most of the automobile loans were made through a network of auto dealerships in maryland  delaware  pennsylvania and virginia 
auto loans that were made through this network of dealerships ended the year at million 
marine loan balances ended with million  and were produced primarily through correspondent brokers 
home equity lines of credit totaled million at the end of while direct second mortgage loans ended the year at million 
the bank s focus in commercial real estate lending has been on financing commercial and residential construction  as well as on intermediate term commercial mortgages 
properties securing the loans include office buildings  shopping centers  apartment complexes  warehouses  residential building lots and developments 
average commercial real estate mortgage loans increased million or while average commercial construction loans increased million or 
average residential construction loans increased million or to end the year at million 
the commercial loan portfolio consists of general business loans  including asset based loans  primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the baltimore  maryland and washington  dc metropolitan areas 
the bank stresses the importance of asset quality as well as the development of new marketing programs 
average commercial loans declined by million  or  ending the year at million 
this decline is associated with a decision to reduce the bank s exposure to national syndicated credits 
at december   national syndicated credits represented of the total loan portfolio  down from at december  the bank has minimal exposure to highly leveraged transactions hlts 
hlts are loans to borrowers for the purpose of purchasing or recapitalizing a business in which the loans represent a majority of the borrower s liabilities 
hlts totaled million as of year end  and all are performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  renegotiated loans and real estate and other assets that have been acquired through foreclosure or repossession 
past due loans are loans that are days or more past due as of december and still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection 
the bank does not place consumer loans on non accrual status as delinquent consumer loans outstandings and any uncollected interest is generally charged off at the time such loan would be placed on non accrual status 
information with respect to non performing assets and past due loans is presented in table for the years indicated 
as shown in the table  total non accrual loans decreased million  mainly in commercial business 
this decrease is due to one national shared health care relationship in which part of the largest portion was written off during the third quarter of the financial condition of the health care industry remains weak  but the corporation has been closely monitoring these and several other of the bank s health care industry credits where the operators have had to adjust to changes in medicare reimbursement policies 
the entire health care portfolio represents of the bank s total loans  down from at december  the increase in past due consumer loans is related to purchases in the acquired portfolio  the majority of which are secured by residential real estate 
non performing assets and past due loans ended the year at million and million  respectively

prior to  consumer loans were generally placed into non accrual status at days past due and subsequently charged off 
beginning in  to conform to standard industry practice  consumer loans are not placed in non accrual status but are generally charged off at days past due for installment loans and days for revolving loans 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb potential losses 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
determination of the adequacy of the allowance  which is performed quarterly  is accomplished by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves  based on historic and anticipated loss experience  to all other loans 
management believes that the allowance at december  will be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
while the corporation believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
the following table reflects the allowance for possible loan losses and the activity during each of the respective years

allowance for loan losses to year end loans the continued emphasis on loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits has resulted in a strong credit portfolio 
senior managers meet at least monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and at least quarterly with executive management to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is determined by management s evaluation of the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
based upon the evaluation of credit risk  loan loss provisions in the form of charges to operations are made to bring the allowance up to a level management believes is adequate 
an analysis of the loan portfolio was performed at december   and expected losses have been provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
during  the loan loss allowance increased thousand to million at year end 
this increase is related to the increase in credit exposure as the total loans increased million  million from the residential mortgage loans 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non accrual loans was at december   compared to the prior year 
the portion of the allowance which is allocated to non accrual loans  is determined by estimating the potential loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
the corporation maintains a loan classification and review system to identify those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
estimated potential losses from internally criticized loans have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses

in addition to investment securities  the corporation invests in federal funds sold  reverse repos  mortgage loans held for sale and other short term investments referred to in total as the investment portfolio 
the strategies employed in the management of these portfolios depend upon the liquidity  interest sensitivity and capital objectives and requirements of the corporation

management s principal objectives for the investment portfolio during were to maintain an appropriate level of quality  to ensure sufficient liquidity in various interest rate environments while maximizing yield and to increase net income by utilizing excess capital 
to successfully achieve these objectives  the corporation employed off balance sheet and on balance sheet strategies 
total investment securities increased million during as a result of securitizing million of purchased consumer loans during the third quarter of notional amounts of off balance sheet positions totaled million at december  compared to billion at december  the corporation segregates its investment securities into three categories held to maturity  trading  and available for sale 
all securities in the available for sale category must be measured at fair market value 
the resulting gain or loss is excluded from revenue but is reflected as a change in stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
trading securities must be measured at fair value and changes included in income for the period 
as of december   the corporation had no investments classified as trading securities 
securities designated as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
at december   the available for sale portfolio included net unrealized losses of approximately million  compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  in addition to unrealized gains and losses  the corporation realized million in gains and thousand in losses from the sale of securities from the available for sale portfolio in these sales were the result of management s continuous monitoring of the investment securities portfolio in terms of both performance and risks 
liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
the bank s asset liability management committee has established general guidelines for the maintenance of prudent levels of liquidity 
the committee continually monitors the amount and source of available liquidity  the time required to obtain it and its cost 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet funding needs in the foreseeable future 
primary sources of liquidity at december  were investment securities available for sale and scheduled loan repayments 
investment securities available for sale totaled billion

an important element in liquidity management is the availability of borrowed funds 
at december   short term borrowings totaled million  or  of liabilities in contrast to million  or  of liabilities at december  another key element in liquidity management is the use of brokered cds 
brokered cds at december  amounted to billion  a million decrease from the same period last year

interest sensitivity management the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize this risk 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that is performed regularly as an important component of management s analysis of the impact of changes in asset and liability portfolios 
control of the corporation s interest sensitivity position is accomplished through the structuring of the investment and funding portfolios  securitizing loans for possible sale  the use of variable rate loan products and off balance sheet derivatives 
management does not try to anticipate changes in interest rates 
its principal objective is to maintain interest margins in periods of both rising and falling rates 
traditional interest sensitivity gap analyses alone do not adequately measure an institution s exposure to changes in interest rates because gap models are not sensitive to changes in the relationship between interest rates charged or paid and do not incorporate balance sheet trends and management actions 
each of these factors can affect an institution s earnings 
accordingly  in addition to performing gap analysis  management also evaluates the impact of differing interest rates on net interest income using an earnings simulation model 
the model incorporates the factors not captured by gap analysis by projecting income over a twenty four month horizon under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
as of december   the corporation s interest sensitive liabilities exceeded interest sensitive assets within a one year period by billion  or of assets 
the bank s savings products are structured to give management the ability to reset the rates paid on a monthly basis 
this causes the bank to become more liability sensitive 
if interest rates rise  the rate paid on savings deposits may follow  and the corporation s net interest margin may decline 
management continues to take steps to protect the bank from possible changes in interest rates 
in  these steps included lengthening the maturities on purchased funds and certificates of deposits and shortening asset maturities with interest rate swaps and caps 
management monitors the interest rate environment and employs appropriate off balance sheet strategies to address potential changes in interest rates 
these strategies lower the net interest margin but are designed to maintain an acceptable margin in a changing rate environment 
as a result of off balance sheet transactions undertaken to insulate the bank from interest rate risks  interest income decreased by thousand and interest expense increased by million  for a total decrease of million in net interest income for the year ending december  as of january   the corporation will adopt financial accounting statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

upon adoption  this statement requires the corporation to mark to market all derivative instruments as a transition adjustment 
this transition adjustment is estimated to be a million after tax loss 
the corporation plans to close the derivative instruments that will not qualify for the shortcut method under sfas no 
which is not expected to result in a material gain or loss 
under the shortcut method  an entity may conclude that the change in the derivative s fair value is equal to the change in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk  resulting in no ineffectiveness 
therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to adversely impact the earnings from continuing operations of the corporation in stockholders equity it is necessary for banks to maintain a sufficient level of capital in order to sustain growth  absorb unforeseen losses and meet regulatory requirements 
in addition  the current economic and regulatory climate places an increased emphasis on capital strength 
in this environment  the corporation continues to maintain a strong capital position

in the second quarter of  the corporation issued a stock dividend and all earnings per share figures have been adjusted for this dividend 
on february   the corporation entered into an agreement to repurchase approximately million shares of common stock directly from mid atlantic investors  a major stockholder 
these shares will be repurchased by the corporation at a fixed price of per share 
the transaction will be executed in portions  but in its entirety prior to march  funding will be provided through asset sales and will not affect liquidity requirements in the future 
the corporation exceeds all regulatory capital requirements as of december  the standards used by federal bank regulators to evaluate capital adequacy are the risk based capital and leverage ratio guidelines 
equity for regulatory purposes does not include market value adjustments as required by sfas no 
risk based capital ratios measure core and total stockholders equity against risk weighted assets 
the corporation s core capital is equal to common stock  capital surplus and retained earnings less treasury stock 
the calculation of the corporation s total stockholders equity  for these purposes  is equal to the above plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations and capital securities less goodwill 
risk weighted assets are determined by applying a weighting to asset categories and certain off balance sheet commitments based on the level of credit risk inherent in the assets 
at december   the corporation s total capital ratio was compared to the minimum regulatory guideline of 
in addition  core common stockholders equity tier capital must be at least of risk weighted assets 
at year end  tier capital ratio was 
the leverage ratio represents core capital  as defined above  divided by average total assets 
guidelines for the leverage ratio require the ratio of core stockholders equity to average total assets to be to basis points above a minimum  depending on risk profiles and other factors 
the bank s leverage ratio of at december  was well in excess of this requirement
