item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in connection with item business  item selected financial data  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
background presstek  inc the company or presstek  incorporated in delaware in  is a leading developer of non photographic  digital imaging and printing plate technologies for the printing and graphic arts industries 
presstek s products and applications incorporate its patented  proprietary pearl r and di r digital imaging technologies and utilize pearl consumables for computer to plate ctp and direct to press applications 
the company s patented di and pearl thermal laser diode product family  enables its customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively 
in the late s  the company developed a direct imaging system that would allow digitally formatted file data to be used to image a plate directly on the printing press 
presstek s technology and products use thermal energy generated by lasers to reproduce digital files directly onto printing plates 
this eliminates the daylight sensitive  photomechanical and chemical processes associated with other imaging methods 
the company is also engaged in the development of additional pearl and di products that incorporate its patented  proprietary  digital imaging system and process free thermal ablation printing plate technologies for ctp and direct to press applications 
in fiscal  presstek and ryobi limited ryobi of japan completed the development of an a format size four color sheet fed press  which was introduced in may  and will be marketed by ryobi as the di 
incorporating presstek s dual plate cylinder concept  this press also features the company s internal automated plate cylinder design  profire tm technology  and pearldry tm spooled plates 
the small format of this press is designed to appeal to quick printers  in plant printers  and copy centers looking to expand their service with offset color printing 
during fiscal the company entered into an agreement with xerox corporation xerox to supply xerox with a series of three presstek enabled di presses and related consumables  which will be marketed  distributed and serviced worldwide on a co branded basis 
the products included in the xerox relationship are four and five color versions of a b size sheet fed press  which will be marketed as the docucolor di and an a size four color sheet fed press  which will be marketed as the docucolor di 
these presses incorporate the company s internal automated plate cylinder design  the profire imaging technology and pearldry spooled  printing plates 
the company s relationship with xerox is in its early stages 
due to a number of factors  there has been a three to four month delay in the delivery of presses to xerox versus that which had been planned under the xerox agreement 
initial press shipments  customer support training programs and other activities are progressing  but at this time  there can be no assurance that additional delays will not result in reduced press shipments to xerox in fiscal the company also has agreements with a number of other companies including adamovske strojirny a 
s 
adast  nilpeter a s  werner kammann maschinenfabrik gmbh  sakurai graphic systems corp  and akiyama printing machinery manufacturing corporation 
these agreements typically are for the use of the company s direct imaging systems  technology licenses  and or thermal plate materials 
they include a variety of direct to offset printing applications ranging from high quality label production and printing on aluminum cans to the production of standard four color printing 
in april the company incorporated an arizona subsidiary  lasertel  inc lasertel for the purpose of securing its supply of laser diodes 
lasertel is located in the former delta v technologies  inc delta v facility in tucson  arizona  and is primarily engaged in the manufacture and development of the company s high powered laser diodes 
while the company established lasertel primarily to gain some control over the source of laser diodes  the nature of lasertel s technology and the company s available capacity have enabled lasertel to find additional market applications for its laser technology 
as a result  lasertel is also currently developing laser prototypes for qualification to the telecommunications  defense  and medical industries 
lasertel has particular experience in the design and fabrication of multi mode high power laser diodes 
this experience spans ten years of development activity at presstek and is expected to support applications in telecommunications as well as graphic arts 
there can be no assurance  however that these products will be commercially successful or produce significant revenues for the company or lasertel 
in fiscal the company discontinued the operations of its delta v subsidiary to allow the company to further focus its efforts on the core business of digital imaging and plate manufacturing 
located in tucson  arizona  delta v was engaged in the development  manufacture  and sale of vacuum deposition coating equipment for vacuum coating applications 
the company concluded the operations of delta v as of the end of the fiscal as a result of the divestiture of delta v  the company incurred an million loss on disposal of discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended january  this included actual closing costs and operating losses incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million  a provision for anticipated closing costs of million  million related to the write off of goodwill and other intangibles assets  and a reduction in other asset values of million 
these costs were partially offset by proceeds of million received from minnesota mining and manufacturing co  m for the licensing of the company s intellectual property relating to vacuum deposited polymer multi layer technology 
delta v is reported separately as a discontinued operation  and prior periods have been restated in the company s financial statements  related footnotes and the management s discussion and analysis to conform to this presentation

references to we  us  our or ours refer to the company and its subsidiaries 
we are dependent on our strategic alliances and manufacturing and distribution relationships and our inability to develop new market channels with new or existing strategic partners could harm our business 
our strategy to date has been  in part  to enter into strategic alliances with major companies in the graphic arts industry and other markets 
this strategy has included  among other things  licensing our intellectual property  developing specialized products based on our proprietary technologies and manufacturing imaging systems for inclusion in other manufacturers products 
our strategy has also involved identifying strategic partners to aid in developing new market channels for our products 
such a strategy led to the development of an important long term relationship with heidelberg druckmaschinen ag heidelberg 
since entering into our strategic alliance with heidelberg  our sales of products to heidelberg have constituted a material portion of our total revenues 
for the fiscal year ended december   our sales to heidelberg accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
there can be no assurance that our relationship with heidelberg will continue 
the loss of heidelberg as a customer would materially adversely affect our business 
in december we agreed with heidelberg to enter into arbitration to resolve certain issues between us concerning on press imaging 
this arbitration is still in progress 
we are also dependent on other strategic partners  including xerox  for future sales of both existing and planned products 
this dependency means that the timetable for finalizing development  commercialization and distribution of both existing and planned products is dependent upon the needs and circumstances of our strategic partners 
we have experienced and will continue to experience technical difficulties from time to time which may prevent us from meeting certain production and distribution targets 
any delay in meeting production and distribution targets with our strategic partners may harm our relationship with them and may cause them to terminate their relationship with us 
they may terminate their relationship with us for circumstances beyond our control  including  factors unique to their business or their business decisions 
we are unable to control factors related to the business of our strategic partners 
as an example  in march  adamovske strojirny a 
s 
adast  a manufacturing partner of ours  announced that it has cash flow problems which could potentially affect delivery of our presses 
adast s inability to resolve their current short term financial situation could significantly reduce the number of our presses that are produced and shipped under this relationship  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as a result of the uncertainties surrounding many of our strategic partners  there can be no assurance that our existing strategic relationships will prove successful or that we will enter into additional strategic partnerships 
there can be no assurance that our relationship with xerox  adast or any of our other strategic  manufacturing and distribution partners will be successful 
the loss of xerox  adast or other principal customers or strategic partners could materially adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our inability to maintain an adequate supply of advanced laser diodes and other critical components could adversely effect us 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our increased demand for these components may put strain on the ability of our third party suppliers to deliver critical components in a timely manner 
for example  our requirements for advanced technology laser diodes for use in products incorporating our pearl and di technology has increased and is expected to increase in the future 
although we have recently established lasertel  a subsidiary that will focus its efforts on helping us meet our demand for laser diodes  we are still substantially dependent on third party manufacturers for our supply of laser diodes and other necessary components 
if we are unable for any reason to secure an uninterrupted source of advanced laser diodes and other critical components at prices acceptable to us  our operations could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that lasertel will be able to manufacture advanced laser diodes in quantities that will fulfill our future needs 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative suppliers for our laser diodes or other critical components should our current supply channels prove ineffective 
we have a history of recent losses and may incur future losses 
although we achieved net income of million for the fiscal year ended december   we sustained net losses of million and million during our fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be profitable in the future or that we will not sustain significant losses in the future 
recently introduced products that incorporate our technology may not be commercially successful and may not gain market acceptance 
achieving market acceptance for any products incorporating our technology requires substantial marketing and distribution efforts and expenditure of significant sums of money and allocation of significant resources  either by us  our strategic partners or both 
we may not have sufficient resources to do so 
likewise  there can be no assurance that products recently introduced by our strategic partners  such as the docucolor di and docucolor di presses  or our recent new product offerings such as our anthem tm plates and dimension tm platesetter  will achieve widespread market acceptance or that any of our other current products or any future products that we may develop or any future products produced by others that incorporate our technologies will achieve market acceptance or become commercially successful 
our manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet the demand for our products 
if demand for our products grow  our current manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet this demand resulting in production delays and a failure to deliver products in a timely fashion 
we may be forced to seek alternative manufacturers for our products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to do so 
as we introduce new products  we may face production and manufacturing delays due to technical and other unforeseen problems 
any manufacturing delay could have an adverse affect on our business and our revenues and may harm our relationships with our strategic partners 
our business is dependent on general market factors affecting our industry and the economy as a whole 
we are dependent on market conditions that affect our industry generally  and additionally  are also dependent on general economic and market conditions as a whole 
a downturn in our industry or the economy as a whole  could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the expansion of our lasertel business into areas other than the printing business may be unsuccessful 
our subsidiary  lasertel  which was formed for the purpose of supplying us with laser diodes  is in the process of developing laser prototypes for the telecommunications  defense and medical industries 
there can be no assurance that these prototypes will gain acceptance in these industries and likewise  there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially successful 
our executive team has limited experience in the telecommunications  defense and medical industries and there can be no assurance that lasertel will be able to successfully exploit any opportunities that may arise 
our newly incorporated subsidiary  lasertel  may require additional capital infusions from us 
our subsidiary  lasertel  which was incorporated to help us meet our demand for laser diodes  may require a significant amount of capital investment by the company in order to establish and maintain its operations 
lasertel s capital needs may exceed the company s ability to provide such funds  requiring the company to borrow against its credit facilities or seek to obtain outside financing for lasertel s operations 
this could have an adverse impact on our business 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
we have been issued a number of us and foreign patents and we intend to register for additional patents where we deem appropriate 
we also hold two registered trademarks and we may register additional trademarks where we deem appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the issuance of any additional patents or trademarks or the breadth or degree of protection which our patents  trademarks or copyrights may afford us 
there is rapid technological development in the electronic image reproduction industries  resulting in extensive patent filings and a rapid rate of issuance of new patents 
although we believe that our technology has been independently developed and that the products we market do not infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of others  it is possible that such infringement of existing or future patents or violation of proprietary rights may occur 
in such event  we may be required to modify our product designs or obtain a license 
no assurance can be given that we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions or even at all 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to successfully defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
moreover  we may be unable  for financial or other reasons  to enforce our rights under any patents we may own 
in august creo products inc filed an action in the united states district court for the district of delaware against us seeking a declaration that creo s products do not and will not infringe any valid and enforceable claims of any of our patents in question 
we have counter claimed against creo for patent infringement of certain of our patents 
this action is ongoing 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this action 
we also rely on proprietary know how and employ various methods to protect the source codes  concepts  ideas and documentation of our proprietary software 
however  such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such know how or obtain access to our know how or software codes  concepts  ideas and documentation 
although we have and expect to have confidentiality agreements with our employees and appropriate vendors  there can be no assurance that such arrangements will adequately protect our trade secrets 
we face substantial competition in the sale of our products 
we compete with manufacturers of conventional presses and products utilizing existing plate making technology  as well as presses and other products utilizing new technologies  including other types of direct to plate solutions such as companies that employ electrophotography as their imaging technology 
canon inc  indigo nv  xeikon nv and xerox corporation are companies that have introduced color electrophotographic copier products 
various companies are marketing product versions manufactured by these companies 
we are also aware that there is a direction in the graphic arts industry to create stand alone computer to plate imaging devices for single and multi color applications 
most of the major corporations in the graphic arts industry have developed and or are developing and marketing off press computer to plate imaging systems 
to date  devices manufactured by our competitors  for the most part  utilize printing plates that require a post imaging photochemical developing step  and in some cases  also require a heating process 
potential competitors in this area include  among others  agfa gevaert nv  dai nippon screen manufacturing ltd  heidelberger druckmaschinen ag  and creo products  inc we also anticipate competition from printing plate manufacturing companies that manufacture  or have the potential to manufacture digital thermal plates 
these companies include agfa  kodak polychrome graphics and fuji photo film co  ltd 
products incorporating our technologies can also be expected to face competition from conventional methods of printing and creating printing plates 
most of the companies marketing competitive products or with the potential to do so are well established  have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than us and have established reputations for success in the development  sale and service of products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
we may not be able to adequately respond to changes in technology affecting the printing industry 
our continuing product development efforts have focused on refining and improving the performance of our pearl and di technology and our consumables and we anticipate that we will continue to do so 
the printing and publishing industry has been characterized in recent years by rapid and significant technological changes and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced products with features which render our technologies  or products incorporating our technologies  obsolete or less marketable 
our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically competent research and development staff and to stay ahead of technological changes and advances in our industry 
there can be no assurance that any refined or improved versions of current products or technologies or any new products that may be introduced by us in the future will be commercially successful 
ongoing litigation could have an adverse impact on our business 
from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may be subject to certain lawsuits 
we are currently a defendant in a lawsuit commenced by ppg  inc claiming that equipment sold by our now discontinued delta v subsidiary did not meet certain product specifications 
although we intend to vigorously defend this action  we could be adversely affected if the plaintiff were to prevail on its damage claim  which is in excess of million 
we are also a party in ongoing patent litigation with creo products inc there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this action  and any adverse result in this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our business 
the loss or unavailability of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the success of presstek is largely dependent on the personal efforts of robert hallman  our president and chief executive officer  and richard williams  our chairman and chief scientific officer 
we have entered into employment agreements with each of mr 
hallman and mr 
williams 
the loss or interruption of the services of either mr 
williams or mr 
hallman could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
our success may also be dependent on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified engineering  technical  sales  marketing and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel 
our stock price has been and could continue to be extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations 
the securities markets have experienced  and are likely to experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements by us or other industry participants  changes in national or regional economic conditions  changes in securities analysts estimates for us  our competitors or our industry or our failure to meet analysts expectations  and general market conditions 
certain factors may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of our common stock outstanding 
approximately  of our shares are currently freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of all of the remaining shares have been held by their holders for over one year and are eligible for sale  subject  in some cases  to affiliate and other restrictions under rule of the securities act of the sale of a significant number of shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
there are currently outstanding options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at prices ranging from per share 
substantially all of these shares have been registered for resale and may be sold  subject  in some cases  to volume and other limitations under rule of the securities act of to the extent they are exercised or converted  the percentage ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted and our stock price could be adversely affected 
this could also adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional equity capital in the future  since the holders of outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in the outstanding options 
in addition  in connection with the settlement of the consolidated class action involving us  we are obligated to issue an additional  shares of common stock 
these shares  when issued  will not be restricted in the hands of the holders and thus  the holders will be able to immediately sell the shares 
this could have a depressive effect on the market for our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  and to a lesser extent  its investing activities 
the majority of the company s long term borrowings are in fixed rate instruments  or variable rate instruments with fixed rate conversion provisions 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements or other speculative or leveraged transactions 
the company currently has no material exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its short term investments the company has limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk as substantially all of its transactions are denominated in us dollars 
some of the company s customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states  however 
as a result  the company s customers and strategic partners are themselves subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the united states dollar  their ability to purchase and market the company s products could be adversely affected and the company s products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on the company s business 
likewise  some of the company s suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with the company 
decreases in the value of their home country currency versus that of the united states dollar could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on the company s business
