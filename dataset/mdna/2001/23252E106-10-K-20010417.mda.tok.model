item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s debt portfolio  including interest rate swap agreements  as of december   is comprised of debt denominated in us dollars 
the company has both fixed and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portion of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial position of the company  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial position 
at december  and  the company had fixed rate debt with a book value of  and  respectively 
the company believes that book value approximates fair value for this debt 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels at december   with all other variables held constant 
the company does not believe that a basis point increase or decrease in market rates would result in a material decrease in the net financial position of the company because the difference between market rates and the fixed rate is not significant over the short remaining term of the fixed rate debt 
at december  and  the company had variable rate debt with a book value of  and  respectively  including term debt with a principal balance outstanding of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company uses an interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge against future changes in interest rates on its term debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional  and  in interest incurred on variable rate debt for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in rates would lower interest incurred on variable rate debt by  and  for the years ended december and  respectively 
a change in interest rates would not impact the net interest incurred or cash flows on the company s term debt because the interest rate on the term debt is effectively fixed as a result of the interest rate swap
