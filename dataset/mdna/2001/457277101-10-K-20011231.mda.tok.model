item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview inktomi corporation is a leading provider of scalable network infrastructure software and services 
inktomi develops  markets  licenses and supports a range of network infrastructure applications that enhance the performance and intelligence of large scale networks  enabling enterprises and network service providers to publish  distribute  manage and retrieve content quickly and efficiently 
in this filing  we are changing how we classify revenues 
in past filings  we classified revenues as either network products or portal services 
network products included revenues from our software license products and related services other than enterprise search software  and portal services included revenues from our web search engine  commerce engine and enterprise search software 
in the past fiscal year  we divested our commerce business  restructured our business to align all of our software products under single management  and saw service revenues associated with our software products become a larger percentage of revenue 
accordingly  in this filing and future filings  we have classified revenues for this period and all earlier periods as 
table of contents licenses  services or web search services 
we believe this change in classification of revenues better reflects the division of our products and services 
licenses revenues are composed of license and upgrade fees in connection with our software products including traffic server network cache platform  content delivery suite software solutions  media products  enterprise search products and our recently introduced products  traffic core  traffic edge  traffic controller and inktomi media publisher 
license fees are generally based on the number of cpus or nodes running the software  or on network traffic throughput across our products  depending on customer deployment  and are generally recognized upon shipment of the software assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
license fees for our enterprise search products are generally based on the number of documents being searched 
services revenues are composed of revenues generated through consulting and support fees related to our software products and through fees generated from our commerce engine 
consulting and support fees are recognized ratably over the service period as the services are performed 
we completed the sale of our commerce division in march and  therefore  services revenues for the quarters ended june  and september  consisted of only consulting and support fees 
web search services revenues are generated through a variety of contractual arrangements related to our web search services  which include general service fees  per query search fees  search service hosting fees and database inclusion fees  all of which are recognized in the period earned 
in fiscal  the business climate in general and our target service provider market in particular experienced a dramatic decline 
this adversely impacted our ability to generate revenues or maintain the revenue growth we achieved in fiscal we have undertaken a number of initiatives to adjust to this new business environment including instituting a strategy of developing and marketing products and services for the enterprise market  reducing expenses through strong cost cutting measures and work force reductions and integrating our sales force such that each person is responsible for selling our complete line of products 
we believe that gaining traction from these efforts will take the next several quarters and be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
our strategy is to grow organically as well as through acquisition 
since fiscal  we have made seven acquisitions and one disposition 
in september  we acquired cb technologies  inc  and in april  we acquired impulse buy network  inc  to initiate our online commerce efforts 
in october  we acquired webspective software  inc  a developer of content distribution and management software 
in july  we acquired ultraseek corporation  and entered into the licensed search and navigation software business 
in october  we acquired fastforward networks  inc  a developer of software solutions for efficiently enabling streaming media over networks 
in december  we acquired various business assets of adero  inc relating to billing  settlement and traffic reporting and licensed other related technologies 
in march  we divested our online commerce business to e centives  inc in june  we acquired escene networks  inc  a developer of advanced streaming media applications and services 
the cb  impulse buy  webspective and fastforward transactions were all accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the ultraseek  adero and escene transactions were each accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
all financial information contained herein has been adjusted to reflect these transactions 
for additional details on these transactions  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included with this annual report 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
for the year ended september  revenues licenses services web search services total revenues cost of revenues licenses services web search services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles and other assets impairment of intangibles and other assets restructuring purchased in process research and development acquisition related costs total operating expenses operating loss impairment of investments other income  net pretax loss income tax provision net loss fiscal years ended september  and revenues revenues totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million or from revenues of million in fiscal no single customer represented over of total revenues in either fiscal or we market and sell our products to customers located in the united states and abroad  both through our direct sales force and through our channel partners 
historically  the percentage of sales to customers located outside of the united states has varied substantially  reflecting the early stage build out of our international operations 
we have generated most of our revenues through direct sales efforts  except in asia where our revenues have been principally generated through our channel partners 

table of contents license revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million or from license revenues of million in fiscal a majority of our license revenues to date have been generated from service providers 
in previous fiscal years  service providers were investing substantial amounts of capital to build out their networks to address internet opportunities 
in fiscal  this segment substantially curtailed spending in response to the challenging economic environment 
our year to year decrease in license revenue is attributable in part to this decrease in spending by service providers 
we believe that in the short term until our enterprise focus takes hold  our revenues will be derived substantially from service providers with revenue contribution from enterprises increasing over time 
we also expect license revenue through our oem relationships to contribute to revenue in fiscal the year to year decrease in license revenue was partially offset by the inclusion of revenue derived from the licensing of our enterprise search product that we launched in earnest in fiscal services revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or over services revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in our support revenues generated from service provider customers who purchased support for our products over the last several fiscal years  partially offset by the termination of revenues derived from our commerce division that was sold in march in order to maintain or grow the level of our services revenues  we will need to renew support agreements that are due to expire over the next fiscal year and enter into new support agreements with new service provider and enterprise customers 
web search services revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million or from web search services revenues of million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to weakness in the internet portal market where many smaller or poorly funded companies could not raise sufficient funds to continue to purchase our services  partially offset by growth in revenue from our larger customers and growth in our index connect and search submit paid inclusion services 
during fiscal and  we recognized revenues of approximately million and million  respectively  on contracts  development  and licensing arrangements with customers in which we were equity shareholders at september  and  respectively 
prices on these contracts and arrangements were comparable to those given to other similarly situated customers 
expenses operating expenses include cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  amortization of intangibles and other assets  impairment of intangibles and other assets  restructuring expenses  acquisition related costs and purchased in process research and development

also included in cost of revenues are expenses associated with our professional services and technical support departments as well as royalties or license fees associated with licensed technologies used in our software applications 
cost of revenues were million for fiscal  representing an increase of million or over cost of revenues of million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to additional depreciation resulting from expansions of our web search data centers  increased royalties associated with our enterprise search software and an increase in expenses related to our technical support and professional services departments 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force and marketing staff and marketing programs  including trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal this increase was

research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount in the first half of fiscal  offset partially by workforce reductions implemented in april and september general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  purchasing  human resources  facilities and legal 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal this increase was primarily related to an increase in headcount and consulting expenses  offset partially by a reduction in relocation and recruiting expenses 
amortization of intangibles and other assets amortization of intangibles and other assets primarily relates to amortization of goodwill acquired through our purchase acquisitions of ultraseek corporation and escene and through our asset purchase from adero 
amortization of intangibles and other assets totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal the increase was primarily due to amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisition of ultraseek in the fourth quarter of fiscal and our adero and escene acquisitions consummated in fiscal impairment of intangibles and other assets we record impairments or write downs of intangibles and other assets when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment should be performed and that assessment indicates that there is an impairment 
events and circumstances that would trigger an impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the manner or extent that an asset is used including a decision to abandon acquired products  services or technologies  a significant adverse change in operations or business climate affecting the asset not considered temporary  and historical operating or cash flow losses expected to continue for the foreseeable future associated with the asset 
an asset is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows projected to be generated from the asset over its remaining useful life is less than the recorded amount of that asset 
impairment losses are measured based on the difference between the asset s fair value and carrying amount and are recorded as impairment write downs in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that an indicator of impairment arises 
during fiscal we recorded million in charges to reflect the impairment of intangibles and other assets  primarily related to our goodwill associated with our investment in airflash and with the assets acquired from adero 
restructuring costs in fiscal  in light of a challenging operating and business environment  we implemented two restructurings and workforce reductions  totaling approximately employee positions  to reduce our operating expenses 
as a result of these workforce reductions  we incurred restructuring charges of million in fiscal the restructuring charge included approximately million of severance related amounts  million of committed excess facilities  million of fixed asset impairments  and million of professional fees 
purchased in process research and development a portion of the purchase prices we paid for ultraseek and various assets of adero have been identified as developed technology and in process research and development iprd 
we identified and valued the 
table of contents developed technology and iprd by conducting extensive interviews  analyzing data provided by the acquired companies concerning developmental products  considering the stage of development of such products and the time and resources needed to complete them  and assessing the expected income generating ability of the products  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows  and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and iprd 
based on our analysis of these variables  we recorded a one time purchased iprd charge of million in fiscal associated with our purchase of various assets of adero  and a one time purchased iprd charge of million in fiscal associated with our ultraseek acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
acquisition related costs as a result of our fastforward acquisition in october and our webspective acquisition in october  we recorded acquisition related cots of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  primarily for investment banking fees  accounting  legal and other professional expenses 
impairment of investments we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment 
our investments in publicly held companies are generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value and such a decline is not considered temporary 
our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investee s operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  limited prospects of receiving additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value  which is the amount we believe is recoverable from our investment 
we recorded write downs of million during fiscal related to impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private companies 
other income  net other income  net includes interest on our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and our long term restricted cash  less expenses related to our debt and capital lease obligations and loss on disposal of assets 
other income  net  totaled million of income in fiscal  a decrease of million or over fiscal the decrease was the result of greater foreign exchange losses  increased realized losses on the sale of investments and lower interest income in fiscal as a result of lower cash balances and declining interest rates 
interest expense decreased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal fiscal years ended september  and revenues revenues totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over revenues of million in fiscal no single customer represented over of total revenues in either fiscal or license revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or over license revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased licenses of the traffic server network cache platform and content delivery suite software solution  particularly to network service provider customers in the content delivery  access and backbone markets 
these revenues consisted primarily of a small number of multi million dollar contracts per quarter and several other smaller contracts generally ranging between million and million 
services revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing and increase of million or over services revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in support revenues associated with our software products and increased commerce revenues 

table of contents web search services revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or over web search services revenues of million in fiscal most of the increase resulted from the addition and launch of new web search customers  primarily smaller and mid tier portals

acquisition related costs in october  we acquired webspective software  inc  a developer of software solutions for content and application distribution  delivery and management  to supplement our software products offerings 
the acquisition of webspective was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we recorded acquisition related costs of approximately million in the quarter ended december   primarily for investment banking fees  accounting  legal and other expenses 

table of contents in april  we acquired impulse buy network  a developer of online merchandising software 
we accounted for the acquisition as a pooling of interests 
we recorded acquisition costs of approximately million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition  primarily for accounting  legal and other expenses 
as of september   all acquisition related costs had been paid 
purchased in process research and development a portion of the purchase price we paid for ultraseek has been allocated to developed technology and in process research and development iprd 
we identified and valued the developed technology and iprd by conducting extensive interviews  analyzing data provided by ultraseek concerning developmental products  considering the stage of development of such products and the time and resources needed to complete them  and assessing the expected income generating ability of the products  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows  and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and iprd 
based on our analysis of these variables  we recorded a one time purchased iprd charge of million in fiscal because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
amortization of intangibles and other assets amortization of intangibles and other assets primarily relates to our purchase acquisition of ultraseek in july as a result of this acquisition  we recorded goodwill of million under intangibles and other assets 
amortization of intangibles and other assets was million in fiscal other income  net other income  net includes interest on our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash less expenses related to our debt and capital lease obligations 
other income  net  totaled million of income in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal most of this increase was generated from million from gains on sales of investments in equity securities and million in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents 
these gains were partially offset by interest expense 
the increase was also offset by the write off of obsolete computer and networking equipment  and interest charges 
we also recognized losses for the abandonment of leasehold improvements and equipment with a net book value of approximately million due to corporate relocation in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at september   a decrease of million or from million at september  the decrease primarily came from cash used in operating activities and investing activities  including purchases of property and equipment and investments in equity securities 
at september  and  our long term restricted cash was million and  respectively 
in november  we completed a public offering of our common stock in which we sold approximately million shares raising million  net of estimated issuance costs and underwriters discounts 
we used million in cash from operations during fiscal as compared to generating a cash flow from operations of million during the prior year 
the change was primarily due to the increase in our net loss and decrease in deferred revenue  partially offset by collections of accounts receivable and an increase in non cash charges 
cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  as compared to cash used in investing of million in the prior year 
the change was primarily the result of reduced strategic investment activity and reduced property and equipment purchases in fiscal and due to the restriction of million of cash in fiscal associated with the lease of our corporate headquarters 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the prior year  as fewer 
table of contents employees exercised stock options due to the change in value of our stock price and many employees participated in our stock option exchange program 
in fiscal  we generated cash from operations of million  as compared to using million in cash from operations in fiscal the change was primarily the result of increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of from the prior year 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a public offering in fiscal that raised million 
investments in equity securities totaled million at september   a decrease of million or from million at fiscal year end september   primarily related to impairment write downs on our investments and decreases in the stock values of the technology companies that comprise our equity investment portfolio 
all of our investments in equity securities are comprised of strategic investments in publicly traded and private technology companies 
from time to time  we have used debt and leases to partially finance capital purchases 
at september   we had million in total loans and capitalized lease obligations outstanding 
our underlying assets collateralize the loans  and the underlying equipment obtained through the lease agreements collateralizes each capitalized lease 
approximately million of our debt at september  was in the form of bank loans 
the bank loans include certain covenants requiring minimum liquidity  tangible net worth and profitability over time  and do not allow us do distribute cash dividends 
as of september   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
in april  we entered into a lease commencing november  for approximately  square feet of office space in two mid rise office buildings in foster city  california 
the lease is for substantially more space than we will need for the next several years 
the commercial real estate market in san mateo county  california is volatile and unpredictable in terms of rental fees  occupancy rates and preferred locations 
if we fail to sublease a significant portion or all of this new space at or above the rate we are paying under the lease agreement  we will incur substantial additional operating expense during the lease term 
aggregate payments to be made under the lease are approximately million over the lease term ending october  payments under the lease will commence when the property is delivered to inktomi by the developer 
we expect this delivery to occur in the quarter ending march  this lease limits the liquidity of million of our cash  which is classified as long term on our balance sheet 
in august  we entered into a lease agreement commencing august  for our corporate headquarters in foster city  california  including all improvements related to this property 
under the lease terms  we are required to pay lease payments for five years to the lessor 
the payments are calculated based on a floating interest rate applied against a million principle value 
future minimum lease payments under this lease are calculated based on the year libor as of september  the agreement was assigned to a third party lessor under the terms of a lease finance structure 
this structure also required the creation and maintenance of a cash collateral account that limits the liquidity of million of our cash  which is classified as long term on our balance sheet 
at the end of the lease term  we have the option to buy the building or to extend the lease 
if we elect not to purchase the building or extend the lease term  we have guaranteed a residual value of million 
we have sublet a portion of our headquarters facilities through july to various subtenants for an aggregate future rental expense offset of million 
our capital and liquidity requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  economic conditions impacting our revenue generation  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing international operations  the resources we commit to facilities  the extent and timing of our investments  the value of our investments in equity securities and real estate  acquisition costs  and the ability to raise capital and other factors 
we believe that we have adequate cash resources to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents factors affecting operating results interested persons should carefully consider the risks described below in evaluating us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our future growth depends on the commercial success of each of our software products and our ability to leverage these technologies to develop  introduce and market new products for emerging markets 
our future growth substantially depends on the commercial success of our traffic server network cache product  our content delivery suite  our media products  and our recently introduced content networking applications 
the markets for these products are in their early stages and we cannot be sure that our target customers will widely adopt and deploy these technologies throughout their networks 
demand for our products has fluctuated significantly over the past several quarters as our core telecommunications and network service provider customers and prospects have deferred and downsized purchases and as the content delivery network market has declined 
we expect this business environment to continue for the foreseeable future  and expect we will need to continue to modify and enhance our products for multiple market segments including in particular the enterprise market 
in this connection  we introduced a suite of content networking applications which includes traffic core  traffic edge  traffic controller and inktomi media publisher 
we are targeting these new products primarily towards enterprise customers and we expect revenues from these products to be modest over the next several quarters 
we cannot be sure we will be successful in our development efforts or that our products will gain market traction 
our future success substantially depends on our ability to generate substantial and sustained revenues from our existing network software products and new content networking products in each of our market segments and substantially increase the number of new and repeat customer transactions 
demand for our streaming media products is dependent on increasing availability of media content on networks  the build out of broadband capabilities and the establishment of profitable business models by our customers  among other factors  all which are outside of our control 
the streaming media market is in its early stages and sales of our media products to date have been modest and fluctuated from quarter to quarter 
the amount of streaming content available over public networks and enterprise networks must increase substantially for some of our potential customers to justify their purchase of our media products 
our media products are complex which may limit their market acceptance and deployment 
growth in sales of our media products in the service provider space depends on the increased availability and usage of broadband access to the internet 
we cannot be sure that broadband access to the internet will grow fast enough or be utilized by enough persons to create a sustainable marketplace for our media products 
in addition  successful business models for the delivery of streaming media content must be developed in order for there to be sufficient demand for our media products in the service provider marketplace 
as we focus on the enterprise content networking market  enterprises building out their content networks must realize the value of live and on demand webcasts  training seminars and other media applications in order for our media products as well as our recently introduced content network applications to be widely adopted 
there can be no assurances that enterprises will adopt streaming or on demand media solutions for the operation of their business or networks  or that our solutions will meet their requirements 
our media products and our content networking applications that enhance the streaming of media rely in part on continued access to third party technology that enables them to effectively recognize and stream media 
failure to maintain our current arrangements to use these third party technologies may adversely affect the appeal our media products 

table of contents our business would be harmed if customers choose not to use or promote our web search services 
revenues from our web search services result primarily from the number of end user searches processed by our search engine 
our agreements with customers do not require them to direct end users to our search services or to use our search services exclusively or at all 
accordingly  revenues from search services are highly dependent upon the willingness of customers to promote and use the search services we provide  the ability of our customers to attract end users to their online services  the volume of end user searches that are processed by our search engine  and the ability of customers to monetize traffic from their web site search pages 
some of our customers have selected competing search and directory services to operate in combination with our services  which has reduced the number of queries available for us to serve and may erode future revenue growth opportunities 
the technological barriers for customers to implement additional services or to replace our services are not substantial 
the market for internet search is maturing and many smaller and medium size portals are not profitable  suffer from declining revenue growth and have limited access to capital to fund operational needs 
many of our smaller search services customers have elected not to renew their contracts and our market opportunity from portals has become more limited 
as a result  our web search revenues are dependent on a relatively few number of major customers 
economic conditions may lead such customers of our web search services to stop paying for such services or to only pay for such services at highly reduced rates 
in order for us to increase revenues from our search engine business  we will need to attract new customers  develop and deliver new search services  products and features to existing and future customers  establish deeper strategic relationships with our customers  and increase the adoption of our index connect and search submit paid inclusion services for content publishers 
we may be unable to grow sales of our enterprise search products 
our revenue growth is dependent upon  among other things  the growth of sales of our search software products to enterprises 
such revenues are derived from software license fees and fees derived from support and upgrades of such software 
a number of factors could cause sales of our enterprise search products to slow or decline 
we face intense competition from companies with more experience in the marketplace and who offer a broad set of products and services to our target customers 
in addition  these companies have deeper strategic relationships and have established well developed channels to sell and distribute their products and services 
we historically have sold our enterprise search products primarily at the departmental level within large enterprises  through a direct sales force 
to expand our market opportunities  we will need to enhance our product and service offerings  effectively market our products as enterprise wide search and navigation solutions  and develop channel and licensing programs to extend our reach and partner with companies offering complementary products to offer collectively a broader set of integrated products 
our success in the enterprise marketplace depends on our ability to navigate a set of market and development challenges 
our shifting focus towards marketing our products to the enterprise market introduces new challenges to our business 
the enterprise market for network infrastructure products and applications is in its early stage and the market may develop more slowly than expected 
our target customers may not be convinced of the productivity  communications  cost and other benefits of large scale network core to network edge content distribution and management  or may believe their existing network infrastructure is adequate to support their needs 
large software and or hardware companies with broad enterprise applications and infrastructure suites may pursue our market segment with integrated offerings that obviate the need for our software applications 
conversely  enterprises may base their network infrastructure purchases on available point applications for which we have limited offerings and limited ability to develop 
we will need to expend resources to develop or acquire additional point applications to drive growth in the enterprise market 
in addition  the point applications that we currently offer may not provide the foothold within the enterprise to up sell our infrastructure software 

table of contents the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition from current and potential competitors in each of our market segments  many of which are bringing new solutions to market  establishing technology alliances and oem relationships with larger companies  and focusing on specific segments of our target markets 
in some cases  our competitors are implementing aggressive pricing and other strategies that are focused in the short term on building customer bases  name recognition in the market and capturing market share 
this may cause some price pressure on our products and services in the future 
we directly or indirectly compete against multiple companies with our software products  including akamai  cacheflow  cisco systems  infolibria  microsoft  netscape  network appliance  novell  realnetworks and volera 
we are aware of numerous other major software developers as well as smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our products 
we also believe that we may face competition from other providers of competing solutions to network infrastructure problems  including networking hardware and software manufacturers  traditional hardware manufacturers  telecommunications providers  cable tv communications providers  software database companies  and large diversified software and technology companies 
many of these companies provide or have announced their intentions to provide a range of software and hardware products based on internet protocols and to compete in the broad internet intranet software market as well as in specific market segments in which we compete 
in the search software market  our primary competitors include altavista  autonomy  dataware  excalibur  fulcrum  lotus  microsoft and verity 
we also indirectly compete in this market with oracle and other database vendors that offer information search and retrieval capabilities with their core database products  and web platform companies such as netscape 
we compete with a number of companies to provide internet search and directory services and technology 
in the web services marketplace  our primary competitors include a variety of established and newer companies  including altavista  ask jeeves  fast search and transfer  google  overture  looksmart  northern light  and yahoo 
these companies and other competitors have focused on search result relevance  database size metrics and ease of use to differentiate their services 
in addition  several large media and other internet based companies have made investments in  or acquired  internet search engine companies and may seek to develop or customize their products and services to deliver to our target customers 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
in addition  our current and potential competitors may bundle their products with other software or hardware  including operating systems  browsers and network hardware in a manner that may discourage users from purchasing products offered by us 
also  current and potential competitors have or may have greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary content 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  fewer search queries served  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the network infrastructure market is rapidly changing and we must develop  acquire  and introduce new products and technologies to grow our revenues and remain competitive 
the network infrastructure market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete 
our future success and revenue growth will depend upon our ability to develop  acquire and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs 
table of contents of our customers  particularly in the content networking and enterprise markets 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
material delays in introducing new products and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our products or to purchase those of our competitors 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will come from our licensed software products 
in the short term  we expect that these revenues will come from licenses to a relatively small number of customers 
the volume and timing of orders are difficult to predict because the markets for our software products are in their early stages and the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 
in addition  many customers in our target markets are scrutinizing their capital spending budgets in light of the slowing economy  and other customers have limited access to capital to fund operational needs 
these companies are shifting their buying patterns as a result  taking a more cautious and measured approach to their network build out plans 
historically  customer orders during a quarter  excluding our search related products and services  have consisted of a small number of multi million dollar deals and several other smaller orders ranging from million to million 
the cancellation  deferral or reduction of even a small number of licenses of any of our products would reduce our expected revenues  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance 
to the extent significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for later quarters may not compare favorably with operating results from earlier quarters 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
despite our recent workforce reductions  we expect to continue to make significant investments to develop and market products for the enterprise and content networking markets  broaden our customer support capabilities  develop new distribution channels  and fund greater levels of research and development 
a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for the reasons already discussed or for any other reason could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and the price of our common stock may fall 
our future revenue growth depends on our ability to improve the effectiveness and breadth of our sales  distribution and support organizations 
we will need to improve the effectiveness and breadth of our direct and indirect sales operations  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase market awareness and sales of our products 
our products and services require sophisticated sales efforts targeted at several people within our prospective customers organizations 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel we are targeting 
in addition  we will need to effectively train and educate our sales force if we are to be successful in selling into the enterprise market  build out our lead management system  complete the deployment of our inside sales force  and improve our overseas sales efforts 
our future revenue growth is dependent upon establishing and maintaining productive relationships with a variety of distribution partners  including oems  resellers  systems integrators and joint marketing partners 
we seek to sign up distribution partners that have a substantial amount of technical and marketing expertise 
even with this expertise  our distribution partners generally require a significant amount of training and support from us  and we anticipate that it will take the next few quarters before our distribution partners will develop the expertise and skills necessary to effectively sell our products 
we may be adversely affected if our distribution partners fail to ship products in a timely manner or according to agreed upon schedules 
in recent quarters we have focused our efforts on entering into oem relationships with prominent network hardware providers to bundle our software products into their hardware offerings 
several risks arise in connection with 
table of contents these relationships including conflicts with our other sales channels  unpredictable product support obligations and reliance on such third parties for sales results 
we require highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we currently have a relatively small customer service and support organization and will need to continue to train our staff to support new customers  new product lines  the expanding needs of existing customers and the internationalization of our business 
competition for customer service and support personnel is intense in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the relevant industries including the internet  telecommunications  commerce and media 
the loss of a key customer could adversely affect our revenues and be perceived as a loss of momentum in our business 
we have generated a substantial portion of our historical revenues from a limited number of customers 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  if we lose a major customer for any reason  including non renewal of a customer contract or a failure to meet performance requirements  or in the case of our search engine business if there is a decline in usage of any customer s search service  our revenues would be adversely affected 
our potential customers and public market analysts or investors may perceive any such loss as a loss of momentum in our business  which may adversely affect future opportunities to sell our products and services and cause our stock price to decline 
we cannot be sure that customers that have accounted for significant revenues in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue to generate revenues in any future period 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with customers and the companies that supply and distribute our products  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with key hardware and software vendors  internet technology and service providers  distribution partners and customers 
we believe these relationships are important in order to validate our technology  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products  enhance our product and service offering  and expand our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
if we are unable to develop these key relationships or maintain and enhance existing relationships  particularly in the areas of streaming audio and video  our traffic server product and our new products for the content networking market  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we have from time to time licensed components from others such as reporting functions and security features and incorporated them into our products and services 
if these licensed components are not maintained  it could impair the functionality of our products and services and require us to obtain alternative products from other sources or to develop this software internally 
in either case  this could involve costs and delays as well as diversion of engineering resources 
the legal environment in which we operate is uncertain and claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
our products and services operate in part by making copies of material available on the internet and other networks and making this material available to end users from a central location or local systems 
in addition  our portal services technology systems collect end user information  which we use to deliver services to our customers and our customers use to deliver services to their users 
this creates the potential for claims to be made against us either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with customers for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or under other legal theories based on the nature  content  copying  dissemination  collection or use of these materials 
these claims have been threatened against us from time to time and have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against online service providers 
it is also possible that if any information provided through any of our products or services contains errors  third parties could make claims against us for losses 
table of contents incurred in reliance on this information 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
internet related laws could adversely affect our business 
laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
the united states congress has enacted internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations as well as legislation governing e commerce  copyrights and caching 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
the adoption  implementation or modification of laws and regulations relating to the internet  or interpretations of existing law  could adversely affect our business 
any acquisitions we make could adversely affect our operations or financial results 
we have made seven acquisitions since september and may invest in or acquire complementary companies  products and technologies in the future 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations and maintaining acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
also  we could have difficulty in integrating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
there could be potential unknown liabilities associated with the purchased company 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need to succeed 
our primary asset is the intellectual capabilities of our employees 
we are therefore dependent on recruiting and retaining a strong team of personnel across all functional areas 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract or retain the highly qualified personnel necessary for our success 
our employment relationships are generally at will 
we have had key employees leave us in the past and we can make no assurance that one or more will not leave us in the future 
if any of our key employees were to leave us  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
many of our key employees have reached or will soon reach the four year anniversary of their hiring date and will be fully vested in their initial stock option grants 
while our key employees are typically granted additional stock options to provide additional incentive to remain with us  the initial option grant is typically the largest and an employee may be more likely to leave us upon completion of the vesting period for the initial option grant 
in light of current market conditions  we may undertake programs to retain our employees that may be viewed as dilutive to our shareholders 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than our chief executive officer 
our efforts to increase our presence in markets outside of the united states may be unsuccessful and could result in losses 
we market and sell our products in the united states and internationally  principally europe and asia 
historically  the percentage of sales to customers located outside of the united states has varied substantially  reflecting the early stage build out of our international operations 
we have limited experience in developing 
table of contents localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  other inherent risks may apply to international markets and operations  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  the impact of changes in foreign currencies  in particular the eu s conversion to the euro  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
we also have limited experience operating in foreign countries and managing multiple offices with facilities and personnel in disparate locations 
we may not be able to manage our resources effectively  coordinate our efforts  supervise and train our personnel or otherwise successfully manage our resources 
the laws and cultural requirements in foreign countries can vary significantly from those in the united states 
the inability to integrate our business in these jurisdictions and to address cultural differences may adversely affect the success of our international operations 
intellectual property claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry 
we expect that software products may be increasingly vulnerable to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we believe that many companies have filed or intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology that they may claim our technology infringes 
some of these companies have sent copies of their patents to inktomi for informational purposes 
we cannot be sure that these parties will not make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and technology 
to this point  in august  network caching technology llc nct initiated an action against us that our caching products violate one or more patents owned by nct 
the complaint seeks compensatory and other damages and injunctive relief 
this case  and any future actions initiated against us  will be time consuming and expensive to defend  will direct management s attention and resources  and could cause product shipment delays or require us to reengineer our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
anti takeover provisions contained in our charter and under delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law prohibiting  under some circumstances  publicly held delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with some stockholders for a specified period of time without the approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting stock 
such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us  even if such events could be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of the stockholders 
in addition  such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions  in addition to provisions contained in our charter  may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in our control or management 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in 
table of contents operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  announcements of technological alliances and partnerships  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposure 
we limit our interest rate risks by placing our marketable securities investments with high quality issuers principally in united states government and corporate debt securities with terms of less than two years 
we do not expect any material losses from our marketable securities investments and believe that our interest rate exposure is modest 
we sell our products and services in the united states and abroad 
historically  the percentage of sales to customers located outside the united states has varied substantially 
we currently transact substantially all of our revenues  whether domestic or abroad  in united states currency 
our expenditures and consolidated financial results could be affected by a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar versus a foreign currency
