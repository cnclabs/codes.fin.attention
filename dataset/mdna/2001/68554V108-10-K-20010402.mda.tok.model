partially offsetting this sales growth will be the elimination of million of annual revenue associated with the suspended serum western blot product line 
in february  the company announced the indefinite suspension of its serum western blot product 
this product has historically been unprofitable due to low production yields and the high cost of ensuring the quality of the end product

research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in research and development efforts were focused on the development of the oraquick hiv rapid test  upt development  commercialization of the intercept service  and fda regulatory compliance 
upt efforts were focused on the development of a lateral flow device  particle size reduction  feasibility studies for on site drugs of abuse and food borne pathogens testing  and development of the uplink reader 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily a result of the company s preparation for the national market launch of the intercept drugs of abuse service in february  establishment of an international sales office in the netherlands  and expanded sales activities for existing product lines

the company accounted for the purchase price as acquired in process technology expense because  at the date of the transaction  the technology rights acquired by the company related to upt had not progressed to a stage where it met technological feasibility and there existed a significant amount of uncertainty as to the company s ability to complete the development of the technology which would achieve market acceptance within a reasonable timeframe 
in addition  the acquired in process technology did not have an alternative future use to the company that had reached technological feasibility

at december   the company s working capital was approximately million 
liquidity is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated profitability in however  liquidity will be negatively affected by continued investment in research and development  construction of fully automated lateral flow manufacturing lines  principal loan repayments  and ongoing capital expenditure requirements 
the combination of the company s current cash position  available borrowings under the company s credit facilities  and the company s cash flow from operations is expected to be sufficient to fund the company s foreseeable operating and capital needs 
however  the company s cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the progress of the company s research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  changes in existing and potential relationships with strategic partners  the time and cost in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the ability of the company to establish development and commercialization capacities or relationships  the costs of manufacturing  market acceptance of new products and other factors
