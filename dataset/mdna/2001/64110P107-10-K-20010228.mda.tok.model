this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements  as described under forward looking statements and industry data under item of this report 
overview we are a leading provider of software and services for managing and controlling user access to web based e commerce applications 
we introduced our flagship product  siteminder  with the first commercial release of siteminder in november in june  we began shipment of siteminder  the first commercially available directory enabled secure user management solution for web based e commerce applications 
we changed our fiscal year end from march to december  effective with the fiscal period ending december  in  the company delivered two major siteminder releases release which featured unix support  and significant improvements in scalability and performance  and  release that contained expanded single sign on capabilities across multiple domains 
in  the company shipped siteminder release in the first quarter of which included a broad range of new technologies to securely manage and personalize business to business and business to consumer portals 
along with release  netegrity shipped its affiliate services product to enable e business web sites to securely manage inter site users 
siteminder shipped in the third quarter of  as did our new delegated management services product dms 
dms enables organizations to delegate user administration to business partners  remote business units  and employees and customers  satisfying a critical need of enterprises  service providers  and e marketplaces 
we derive our revenues from the sale of siteminder software and services and from revenues related to the resale of check point software technologies firewall software product 
siteminder software revenues are derived from the sale of siteminder product licenses 
siteminder service revenues are derived from fees related to the implementation and maintenance of siteminder and training on the siteminder product 
other revenues are derived from the resale  through a dedicated sales organization  of firewall  complementary products from other vendors and related maintenance  consulting and training services 
siteminder software revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  siteminder services revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  other revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year ended december  and of total revenues in the year ended december  we expect siteminder software and services revenues to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
we currently sell our siteminder products through a combination of our direct sales force  worldwide resellers and licensees 
we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues derived outside of north america will increase 
increasing our international sales may subject us to risks  many of which are outside our control  including economic uncertainties  currency fluctuations  political instability and uncertain cultural and regulatory environments 
our cost of revenues includes  among other things  royalties due to third parties for technology included in our products  product fulfillment costs  and salaries and related expenses for our consulting  education and technical support services organizations  and the associated cost of training facilities 
our operating expenses are classified into two general categories selling  general and administrative and research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for selling  administrative and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  legal and accounting services  public relations  marketing materials  trade shows and certain facilities related expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and outside contractor costs to support product development 
since  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our research and development  sales  marketing and professional services departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
prior to q  we incurred substantial losses and we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in future quarters as we increase sales and marketing operations  expand distribution channels  increase research and development  broaden professional services  expand facilities and support  and improve operational and financial systems 
accordingly  in order to maintain and enhance our profitability  it will be necessary to achieve continued growth in revenues 
although we have experienced significant growth in revenues in recent periods  that growth has been from a relatively small base  and there can be no assurance that those growth rates are sustainable 
therefore  historical growth rates should not be considered indicative of future operating results 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our revenues or sustain profitability
