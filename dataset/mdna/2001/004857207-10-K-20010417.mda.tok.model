item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements below 
overview we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of non powered lawn and garden tools 
we are a holding company with no business operations of our own 
our only material asset is all of the outstanding capital stock of uniontools  inc founded in  we completed an initial public offering in we used a portion of the proceeds of such offering to repay debt associated with a leveraged buyout 
since  we have implemented a business strategy designed to transform us from a manufacturing oriented industrial company into a marketing oriented consumer products company 
the central elements of our approach include a market segmentation strategy based primarily on brand management and a merchandising strategy based on attractive and informative product displays and labeling 
in fiscal  we focused on strategically rationalizing our business model to restore profitability 
this included discontinuing the manufacture and sale of watering products and an emphasis on profitable products and relationships with customers 
during fiscal  improvements in our forecasting and planning processes  we believe  have allowed us to consistently provide the highest service levels in the industry 
we experienced manufacturing inefficiencies during the first half of fiscal  primarily due to the effects of consolidating manufacturing facilities in the second half of calendar those issues have now been addressed and resolved and we have turned our focus to cost savings opportunities  driven by a new senior vice president of operations and a new vice president and general manager of our frankfort  new york manufacturing facility 
we have also decreased the cost of our logistical processes  reducing the number of distribution locations  from three to one location in columbus  ohio 
these reductions were accomplished during fiscal with minimal effect on service level performance 
the net result as it relates to manufacturing and distribution is that we believe that we have been able to correct the problems that arose in calendar and contributed to the operating losses during that time period 
the discontinuation of watering products and cost management on sales support and other overhead expenses has allowed us to lower our selling  general and administrative costs 
we continue to challenge and re evaluate our overhead costs of doing business 
interest costs have become a greater burden to us in fiscal due to higher market rates plus the incremental costs associated with executing the sixth amendment to our credit facility in october this has been tempered by our ongoing efforts to reduce working capital  including an million reduction in inventory requirements 
we are currently in negotiations to extend our existing credit facility through april  we believe an extension will provide sufficient liquidity for us as we move through our operating cycle 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce borrowing costs  including the potential to refinance  as our financial performance improves 
to strengthen our technology platform and resources  all information system functions and support were outsourced to acxiom corporation in november the transition has been essentially completed  with no disruption to our business 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain components of our consolidated statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal calendar year ended months unaudited net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense amortization of intangibles asset impairment other expenses  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss five month period ended unaudited net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense amortization of intangibles asset impairment other expenses  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes benefit loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss fiscal compared to calendar net sales 
net sales decreased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the decline in net sales was caused primarily by lower watering product sales 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold assets related to the manufacturing and sale of watering products 
the sales of long handled tools were slightly lower than a year ago due to the rationalization of unprofitable customers and products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar gross margin increased to for fiscal compared to for calendar the increase in gross profit and margin were driven by several factors improved customer service levels  shipment fulfillment processes  and consolidation of distribution centers 
in addition  we have continued to focus on cost reductions and improvements in logistical and manufacturing process controls to drive year to year gains in fiscal an emphasis on profitable products and relationships with customers has also favorably influenced margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal versus million in calendar as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to in calendar the improvement reflects the elimination of sales and administrative support for the sale of watering products  as well as  productivity gains and cost reductions  including lower sales expenses and a reduction in personnel 
operating income loss 
operating income gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses improved million  to a profit of million for fiscal compared to a loss of million in calendar the improvement in operating income was primarily due to the items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher market rates libor and borrowing costs  as a result of the most current amendment to our loan agreement  and higher borrowing levels during the year 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill decreased to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the reduction in amortization is due to the lower amount of goodwill to be amortized  resulting from the asset impairment charges recognized during these time periods 
asset impairment 
an asset impairment charge of million was recognized in fiscal and a similar charge of million was recorded in calendar we recognized these charges based on our review of the net realizable value on certain long lived assets related to the manufacture and sale of watering products 
other expenses  net 
other expenses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar the improvement is primarily due to the absence of costs associated with the manufacturing consolidation program that we executed in calendar and lower management restructuring costs 
in fiscal  the improvements were partially offset by a loss incurred on the sale of certain assets related to the manufacturing and sale of watering products 
for purposes of comparison  all costs associated with management restructuring have been classified in other expenses 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes decreased million to a loss of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in calendar the decreased loss was primarily due to the items discussed above 
net loss 
net loss decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million in calendar net loss per share basic and diluted was for fiscal  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million  compared to net loss per share of basic and diluted for calendar  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million 
transition compared to the comparable period in net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in transition compared to million in the comparable period of the increase in net sales was caused by higher gross sales of long handled tools  partially offset by lower gross sales of molded products and an increase in allowances and deductions 
strong customer demand  including gains from reduction of order backlog  drove the increase in sales of long handled tools 
the decrease in gross sales of molded products was primarily due to the loss of one significant customer 
the increase in allowances and deductions was primarily a result of continued difficulties in manufacturing and logistical control 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million in transition compared to million in the comparable period of gross margin decreased to in transition from in the comparable period of the declines in gross profit and margin were driven primarily by several factors 
logistical and manufacturing control issues identified in fiscal continued to negatively affect customer service levels and related costs and higher distribution and freight expenses 
unfavorable absorption variances were incurred due to lower production levels resulting from difficulties related to the manufacturing consolidation and due to the timing of expense recognition resulting from changing our fiscal year to a calendar year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for transition compared to million in the comparable period of as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in transition from in the comparable period of the increase was due to investments in marketing related activities and information system infrastructure and associate related expenses  including workers compensation and group benefit costs 
operating income loss 
operating income gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  to a loss of million for transition from breakeven for the comparable period of the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or million  to million for transition compared to million in the comparable period of the increase in interest expense was due to higher debt levels and interest rates  consistent with the change in terms resulting from the amendment of our credit agreement  effective october  amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill remained flat at million in transition and in the comparable period of asset impairment 
an asset impairment charge of million was recognized in transition based on our review of the net realizable value on certain long lived assets 
there was no asset impairment charge taken in the comparable period of other expenses  net 
other net expenses including special charges increased to million in transition from million in the comparable period of the increase was due primarily to costs associated with our manufacturing consolidation program and management restructuring costs offset by the absence of acquisition related costs incurred in the comparable period of the cost of our manufacturing consolidation was higher than anticipated due to inefficiencies in initial production  including training  scrap  and machine repair costs 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes declined million to a loss of million in transition compared to a loss of million in the comparable period of the increased loss was primarily due to the items discussed above 
net loss 
net loss was million in transition compared to a loss of million in the comparable period of net loss per share basic and diluted was in transition  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million  compared to net loss per share of basic and diluted in the comparable period of  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net sales for fiscal reflected an aggregate million of net sales arising from a full year of offering watering products  partially offset by operational inefficiencies in our core business 
gross profit 
gross profit declined million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline in gross profit was driven primarily by several factors 
logistical and manufacturing control issues during negatively affected customer service levels and drove higher customer deductions  distribution and freight costs associated with the revenue for that period 
control issues also contributed to an inventory loss that was discovered by taking a physical inventory count 
at year end  workers compensation reserves were reviewed for all plan years as a result of an estimated settlement of certain open years with our insurance carrier and adjusted to proper levels 
we wrote off product tooling and obsolete inventory related to a discontinued product offering 
excess and obsolete inventory was evaluated and reserves were provided to reflect anticipated value recovery below cost 
accounts receivable in bankruptcy and other aged accounts were reserved 
the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by benefits from our cost reduction program 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to having a full year of costs related to watering products and the write off of uncollectible accounts 
operating income loss 
operating income gross profit less selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to a loss of million in fiscal compared to a profit of million in fiscal the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was due to higher market rates libor and borrowing costs 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in amortization is due to the higher amount of goodwill to be amortized during fiscal other expenses  net 
other expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase related to plant consolidation costs incurred in connection with the consolidation of our columbus  ohio manufacturing facility into our primary facility located in frankfort  new york  and consolidation of the manufacturing operations of our watering products 
we incurred approximately million in fiscal related to management restructuring costs 
we also incurred approximately million in fiscal related to accounting  legal  consulting  and other expenses related to the exploration of strategic transactions 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased million to a loss of million in fiscal compared to a profit of million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the items discussed above 
net income loss 
we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal  a million deterioration compared to a profit of million in fiscal the loss from discontinued operations of million in fiscal primarily reflects a workers compensation accrual adjustment of million for businesses previously sold 
net loss per share basic and diluted was for fiscal  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million  compared to net income per share of basic and diluted for fiscal  based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of approximately million 
seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  impact of weather the lawn and garden industry is seasonal in nature  with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in january through may 
accordingly  our sales tend to be greater during those months 
as a result  our operating results depend significantly on the spring selling season 
to support this sales peak  we must anticipate demand and build inventories of finished goods throughout the fall and winter 
accordingly  our levels of raw materials and finished goods inventories tend to be at their highest  relative to sales  during the last six months of the calendar year 
these factors increase variations in our quarterly results of operations and potentially expose us to greater adverse effects of changes in economic and industry trends 
moreover  actual demand for our products may vary substantially from the anticipated demand  leaving us with excess inventory or insufficient inventory to satisfy customer orders 
weather is the single most important factor in determining market demand for our products and also is the least predictable 
for example  springtime flooding unfavorably affects the sale of most types of lawn and garden equipment  while moderate to heavy snowfall during winters usually results in a surge in demand for snow shovels 
bad weather during the spring gardening season can adversely affect overall annual sales  but if the weather is favorable during construction projects  such as new housing starts and government spending on highways  this usually represents an increase in demand for long handled tools 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited data for each of the quarters in calendar and fiscal the financial data for each of these quarters is unaudited but includes all adjustments which we believe to be necessary for a fair presentation 
all quarters include normal recurring adjustments except for the second quarter of which includes certain adjustments of million related to the write off of obsolete inventory  write off of tooling associated with a discontinued product  increases in the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable  increases in the reserve for workers compensation  and other miscellaneous adjustments 
these operating results  however  are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
calendar quarter ended unaudited in thousands net sales     cost of goods sold     gross profit     selling  general and administrative     expenses sg a gross profit less sg a     net sales as a percentage of full year net sales gross profit as a percentage of full year gross profit fiscal quarter ended unaudited in thousands net sales     cost of goods sold     gross profit     selling  general and administrative     expenses sg a gross profit less sg a     net sales as a percentage of full year net sales gross profit as a percentage of full year gross profit does not include amortization of intangibles and other expenses  each of which generally are non seasonal in nature 
second quarter gross profit less sg a would have been a million loss if you exclude the million effect of the unusual year end charges described above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service 
we have financed our working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility the credit facility 
net cash provided by continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in continuing operations of million in calendar the million improvement in net cash provided by continuing operations was due to a million gain in net income  improved further by higher non cash charges taken in fiscal improvements in accounts receivable and inventory offset net unfavorable changes in pay ables and other liabilities 
lower accounts receivable and inventory levels were the result of the discontinuation of the manufacture and sale of watering products  as well as  the liquidation of excess and obsolete inventory 
the results were also favorably influenced by stronger collection efforts in accounts receivable and by more effective forecasting and planning processes in determining inventory needs 
net cash used in continuing operations was million in transition compared to net cash used in continuing operations of million in the comparable period of the million increase in net cash used in continuing operations was driven by a million deterioration in net income  partially offset by a million non cash asset impairment charge 
the results were also favorably impacted by relative improvements in working capital  primarily due to a lower inventory build in transition compared to the comparable period of we fell behind on production and customer requirements due to the time and cost inefficiencies experienced as a result of the manufacturing consolidation occurring during the transition time period 
we made capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  million in transition  million during fiscal  and million in fiscal the capital expenditures relate primarily to ongoing improvements of property  plant and equipment  manufacturing process improvements  and increased manufacturing capacity 
capital requirements were lower during fiscal due to the activity level and expenditures made during transition related to the manufacturing consolidation 
in addition  the discontinuation of the manufacture of watering products lowered investment levels in fiscal in fiscal  expenditures were made primarily at our frankfort  new york manufacturing facility and in strengthening our technology platform 
in transition  the capital expenditures were focused on the consolidation of our columbus  ohio manufacturing facility into the primary facility in frankfort 
the million in proceeds from the sale of assets is the result of the sale of inventory  trademarks  and property and equipment related to the manufacture and sale of watering products 
we utilize our credit facility to finance capital expenditures  fund working capital  and other general business purposes 
as of december   approximately million was available under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
indebtedness outstanding bears interest at variable rates based on libor plus 
we recognized that the restructuring of our operations and the restoration to profitability  while significant  was not sufficient to support a refinancing of the credit facility 
to provide the time and resources necessary to drive us forward  we are currently in negotiations to extend our existing credit facility through april  we continue to evaluate all non strategic assets for purposes of sales  particularly excess or obsolete inventory 
payment terms with both customers and vendors have been impacted favorably  reducing our overall working capital needs 
it is our belief that these actions  combined with the profit improvements already made to the business and the expected extension of the credit facility  will provide us with sufficient liquidity to allow us to move through our operating cycle and to continue strengthening the profitability of the business 
however  if future financial results do not meet our expectations  we will activate contingency plans  further reducing expenditures  and take other actions to operate within the resources available 
effects of inflation we are adversely affected by inflation primarily through the purchase of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and higher interest rates 
we believe that the effects of inflation on our operations have not been material in recent years 
forward looking statements statements in the foregoing discussion that indicate our intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations  or predictions of the future are forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to  among other risks and uncertainties inherent in our business  the following important factors weather is the most significant factor in determining market demand for our products and is inherently unpredictable 
inclement weather during the spring gardening season and lack of snow during the winter may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the lawn and garden industry is seasonal in nature  with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in january through may 
accordingly  our sales tend to be greater during those months 
as a result  our operating results depend significantly on the spring selling season 
to support this sales peak  we must anticipate demand and build inventories of finished goods throughout the fall and winter 
accordingly  our levels of raw materials and finished goods inventories tend to be at their highest  relative to sales  during the last six months of the year 
these factors increase variations in our quarterly results of operations and potentially expose us to greater adverse effects of changes in economic and industry trends 
moreover  actual demand for our products may vary substantially from the anticipated demand  leaving us with either excess inventory or insufficient inventory to satisfy customer orders 
our ten largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately of gross sales in fiscal a substantial reduction or cessation of sales to these or other major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
certain retail distribution channels in the lawn and garden industry  such as mass merchants and home centers  are experiencing consolidation 
there can be no assurance that such consolidation will not have an adverse impact on certain customers or result in a substantial reduction or cessation of purchases of our products by certain customers 
in addition  we are facing increasing pressure from retailers with respect to pricing  co operative advertising  and other rebates as the market power of large retailers continues to grow 
there can be no assurance that such pressures will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
a key element of our growth strategy is to increase sales in certain distribution channels that we believe are growing more rapidly than the overall industry  such as home centers and mass merchants through retailers such as sears and home depot 
there can be no assurance that retailers in such distribution channels will continue to open a significant number of new stores or  if opened  that we will be chosen to supply our products to all or a significant portion of such stores 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such stores will generate significant additional sales for us or that such stores will not result in a reduction of sales to our other customers  whether through consolidation or otherwise 
our future growth and development is largely dependent upon the services of a 
corydon meyer  our president and chief executive officer  as well as our other executive officers 
the loss of mr 
meyer s services  or the services of one or more of our other executive officers  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our products require the supply of raw materials consisting primarily of steel  plastics  and ash wood 
although we have several suppliers for most of our raw materials  there can be no assurance that we will not experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply 
in addition  there can be no assurance that prices for such materials will remain stable 
any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
all aspects of the lawn and garden industry  including attracting and retaining customers and pricing  are highly competitive 
we compete for customers with large consumer product manufacturers and numerous other companies that produce specialty home and garden products  as well as with foreign manufacturers that export their products to the united states 
many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial resources than us 
there can be no assurance that increased competition in the lawn and garden industry  whether from existing competitors  new domestic manufacturers  or additional foreign manufacturers entering the united states market  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
most of our hourly associates are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements 
we currently are a party to four such agreements  one of which expires in and three of which expire in there can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating new labor contracts on terms satisfactory to us or without work stoppages or strikes 
a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations governing  among other things  emissions to air  discharge to waters  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment  and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with these environmental requirements and regularly review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws 
we also have been involved in remediation actions with respect to certain facilities 
amounts expended by us in such compliance and remediation activities have not been material to us 
current conditions and future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations  may  however  give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
furthermore  as is the case with manufacturers in general  if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from our properties or any associated offsite disposal location  or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of our properties  we may be held liable and the amount of such liability could be material 
new housing starts often represent an addition to the overall number of consumers in the lawn and garden tool market and  accordingly  an increase in demand 
similarly  government spending on highways  bridges  and other construction projects often represents an increase in demand for long handled tools 
a decline in housing starts or government spending on construction projects could result in a decrease in demand for our products and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
adverse changes in general economic conditions in the united states  including the level and availability of consumer debt  the level of interest rates  and consumer sentiment regarding the economy in general  could result in a decrease in demand for our products and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we have been notified by nasdaq that we do not currently meet the nasdaq smallcap market s continued listing requirements and that our common stock will be delisted 
we have appealed this decision 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful with such appeal 
our inability to successfully extend our credit facility ongoing  or to extend the credit facility on terms and conditions favorable to us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the factors set forth above are not exhaustive 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we will not undertake  and specifically decline  any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or un anticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors  nor can we assess the impact of each such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
therefore  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation and interest rates we have not been significantly affected by inflation in recent years and anticipate that we will not be significantly affected by inflation in the near term 
a material change in interest rates could have an impact on our financial results as we are presently paying a variable interest rate on our outstanding debt 
in october  we entered into an amendment of our existing credit facility the amended facility 
the amended facility provides for a million revolving credit facility from january through july of each year  million from july through october  and million from november through december in connection with the amended facility  the interest rate charges on outstanding borrowings was increased from libor plus to libor plus
