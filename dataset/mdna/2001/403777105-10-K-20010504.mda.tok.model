primary uses of cash during have been to finance operating activities as compared to and when uses of cash have been to finance the construction of new domestic and international stores 
the combined balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million and million at february  and january   respectively 
working capital as of february  totaled million compared to million at january  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to an increase in borrowings needed to fund the operating loss 
during  gymboree used million in operating activities primarily reflecting an increase of inventory of million coupled with higher deferred income taxes of million plus a net loss of million 
during  investing activities consisted of capital expenditures totaling million 
also during  financing activities provided million reflecting borrowings net of repayments of million and proceeds from issuance of stock of million 
during  gymboree generated million of cash from operations primarily reflecting a reduction of inventory of million coupled with depreciation expense of million that more than offset a net loss of million 
uses of cash in consisted primarily of million for capital expenditures  related largely to the opening of new gymboree stores  the expansion of existing stores and the opening of zutopia stores 
on august   gymboree entered into a three year secured revolving line of credit with fleet retail finance  inc and a syndicate of other lenders 
this facility provides for an overall credit line of million that may be used for working capital and capital expenditure needs and the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 
gymboree s maximum borrowing under the credit facility may not exceed the lesser of a million or b the total of i the adjusted value of acceptable inventory  including eligible letter of credit inventory subject to advance rates  plus ii of gymboree s eligible credit card accounts receivable  plus iii of eligible investments  minus iv applicable reserves 
gymboree s annual capital expenditures are limited to million under this agreement

the interest rate during the term of the facility will be based on the bank s reference rate plus an applicable margin of up to or eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to 
as of february   the interest rate was 
between october  and november   gymboree entered into a series of amendments to the existing secured facility with fleet retail finance  inc that increased the overall credit line to million and reduced certain applicable reserves 
the credit line and applicable reserves have since returned to original levels 
in addition  on august   gymboree obtained a three year term loan for million with back bay capital funding llc with an annual interest rate of 
both the credit facility and term loan are secured by a blanket lien on merchandise inventories and other assets 
during fiscal  gymboree issued two promissory notes totaling million both secured by our distribution center in dixon  california 
the first note of approximately million bears interest at and is due october the second note of approximately million bears interest at and is due january  interest on the promissory notes is payable monthly 
during fiscal  gymboree prepaid principal of approximately  on the first note and  on the second note 
the promissory notes contain certain financial covenants  which require gymboree to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and meet certain ratios 
as of february   gymboree was not in compliance with the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant 
the bank waived non compliance with such covenant 
gymboree estimates that capital expenditures during will be between and million  and will primarily be used to relocate and expand stores  to open approximately new domestic and international stores  to update the store fronts of approximately stores and to upgrade and replace systems 
we anticipate that cash generated from operations  together with our existing cash resources and funds available from current and future credit facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs through fiscal if additional credit facilities are required  no assurance can be given that such facilities will be available under terms acceptable to gymboree 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations gymboree has historically experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our retail sales and net income 
historically  a disproportionate amount of our retail sales and a significant portion of our net income have been realized during the months of november and december 
in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months  gymboree hires a significant number of temporary employees to bolster the store staff 
in addition  we have experienced periods of increased sales activity in early spring and early fall 
if  for any reason  our sales were below seasonal norms during november and december  or during the early spring or early fall  our annual operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
historically  retail sales and net income have been weakest during the second fiscal quarter  and we expect this trend to continue 
gymboree s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the costs and increased overhead associated with the opening and future operation of new stores 
in addition  the sales contributed by new stores  advertising and marketing expenditures  merchandise mix and timing  and level of markdowns may contribute to fluctuations in operating performance
