gathering and processing revenues in reflect the company s share of such revenues generated by wildhorse 
effective july   the company acquired the lisbon natural gas processing plant in the unocal acquisition which generated incremental processing revenue in the second half of and all of gathering and processing revenues increased by in as a result of incremental volumes gathered by wildhorse primarily from the wind river basin where the company has a significant production base 
net marketing and trading income increased from a net loss in and to a profitable gross margin of million in this was attributable to i a general increase in the company s natural gas marketing operations  ii an increase in the volume of gas marketed for third parties and iii lower transportation rates 
drilling revenue associated with the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sauer increased in to million after remaining relatively constant for and the increase in was attributable to higher rig utilization rates and increased day rates resulting from the general increase in activity within the oil and gas industry in costs and expenses expenses related to gas and oil production increased from to due primarily to the acquisition of gas and oil properties and a cyrogenic natural gas processing plant in july from unocal 
on an mcfe basis  gas and oil production costs increased to

expenses related to gas and oil production increased from to due again to the unocal acquisition 
taxes on gas and oil production increased by in and in directly related to the increase in gas  oil and natural gas liquids sales in these periods 
the taxes for through have remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales 
the company s depletion  depreciation and amortization rates per mcfe were   and for years  and  respectively 
the decrease from to  and to  was primarily due to i lower finding and development costs associated with the and reserve additions  ii the impact of reducing the cost basis subject to amortization by the million property impairment recognized in and iii the increase in reserve quantities approximately resulting from upward revisions in the estimated reserve quantities recognized in gathering and processing costs principally represents gas purchased in conjunction with the gas gathering operation to replace gas physically lost in the transmission process and all other costs associated with gathering and processing 
this expense increased in due to increased activity in the gathering operations and as a result of the increase in the commodity price for natural gas during this period 
expenses associated with the company s exploration activities were million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
in  the company increased its exploration program to more fully explore the wind river basin of wyoming 
in  the company s exploration expenditures decreased in comparison to resulting from an overall reduction in capital spending levels for drilling and completion activity 
capital expenditures in increased in comparison to as emphasis was placed upon reserve development during this period  exploration expenses for remaining relatively unchanged in comparison to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses have increased from year to year as a result of the company s higher level of operations

the company recorded income tax provisions of million and million in and  respectively  and an income tax benefit of million in  resulting in effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
at december   the company has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
additionally  statutory depletion carryforwards of approximately million and million of amt credits carryforwards are available to offset future taxes 
based upon the operating results for and the present economic environment for the oil and gas industry  the company believes that it will generate sufficient taxable income in to utilize these carryforwards 
capital resources and liquidity growth and acquisitions the company continues to pursue opportunities which will add value by increasing its reserve base and presence in significant natural gas areas  and further developing the company s ability to control and market the production of natural gas 
as the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities  it will benefit from its financing flexibility and the leverage potential of the company s overall capital structure 
capital and exploration expenditures the company s capital and exploration expenditures and sources of financing for the years ended december   and are as follows in millions capital and exploration expenditures acquisitions sauer drilling company unocal other rocky mountain assets other exploration costs development costs acreage gas gathering and processing other financing sources common stock issued 
net long term bank debt advances from gas purchasers proceeds from sale of assets cash flow from operations before changes in working capital working capital and other 
the company anticipates capital and exploration expenditures between to million in  to million allocated to exploration and development activity 
approximately to million of the anticipated capital program will be incurred on exploration and development opportunities resulting from the acquisition of stellarton in january of the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary and there are no material long term commitments associated with the company s capital expenditure plans 
consequently  the company is able to adjust the level of its capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures by the company will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
historically  the company has funded capital expenditures and working capital requirements with both internally generated cash  borrowings and stock transactions 
net cash flow provided by operating activities after changes in working capital was million for as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was due primarily to the receipt of million from gas purchasers as advances in in july  the company completed an acquisition of substantially all of the rocky mountain oil and gas assets of unocal corporation for million shares of common stock and million in cash 
advance from gas purchasers the company sold mmbtu per day of gas for delivery  but was paid million for the gas in the fourth quarter of as described within the notes to the financial statements 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay bank debt 
bank credit facility the company s credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit with a current borrowing base of million 
the amount of the borrowing base may be redetermined as of december and june of each calendar year at the sole discretion of the lender 
a redetermination as of december  has not yet been made 
the company intends to have in place by the end of the first quarter of  a new combined united states and canadian credit facility with an initial borrowing base of million and a million facility 
this will replace the existing million facility in place at december  to finance the stellarton transaction in january  the company borrowed million under a bridge loan  and an additional million from the company s existing credit facility 
these balances will be incorporated into the revised credit facility 
at december   the aggregate outstanding balance under the credit facility was million  bearing interest at per annum 
the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility at december  was million 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants which require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth as well as certain financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility at december  borrowings under the credit facility are unsecured and bear interest  at the election of the company  at i the greater of the agent bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  plus an applicable margin or ii the agent bank s eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements of the company 
markets and prices the company s revenues and associated cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in gas and oil prices 
all of the company s gas and oil production is currently market sensitive as none of the company s domestic gas and oil production has been presold at contractually specified prices 
during  the average prices received for gas and oil by the company were per mcf and per barrel  respectively  as compared to mcf and per barrel in and per mcf and per barrel in in december  the company believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of the company s production and decided to implement a hedging program 
accordingly  the company entered into several natural gas costless collars put and call options and natural gas basis swaps to correlate the nymex based costless collars back to the various index delivery points where the company s gas is produced 
these positions were intended to hedge approximately of the company s expected domestic gas production 
as of december   the company had open natural gas costless price collars and basis swaps on its production as follows natural gas collars volume basis contract period in mmbtu d floor ceiling swaps first quarter  
second quarter  
third quarter  
fourth quarter  
year average  
based upon the gas index price strip and quoted basis differentials on january   the costless collars were in a million loss position and the basis contracts were in a million gain position on that date 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
future oil and gas prices also could affect results of operations and cash flows 
donald l 
evans resignation effective january   donald l 
evans resigned as the company s chairman and chief executive officer to become the united states secretary of commerce 
mr 
evans received a retirement payment of million in cash 
in addition  the company accelerated the vesting of his outstanding stock options resulting in a non cash  pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million 
both the retirement payment and the non cash charge for the acceleration of the stock options will be recognized by the company in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company utilizes various financial instruments which inherently have some degree of market risk 
the primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rate fluctuations 
price fluctuations the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and natural gas production 
accordingly  in order to increase the financial flexibility and to protect the company against commodity price fluctuations  the company may  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  enter into non speculative hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  forward sale contracts  commodity futures  options and other similar agreements relating to natural gas and crude oil 
derivative financial instruments financial instruments designated as hedges are accounted for on the accrual basis with gains and losses being recognized based on the type of contract and exposure being hedged 
gains and losses on natural gas and crude oil swaps designated as hedges of anticipated transactions  including accrued gains or losses upon maturity or termination of the contract  are deferred and recognized in income when the associated hedged commodities are produced 
in order for natural gas and crude oil swaps to qualify as a hedge of an anticipated transaction  the derivative contract must identify the expected date of the transaction  the commodity involved  and the expected quantity to be purchased or sold among other requirements 
in the event that a hedged transaction does not occur  future gains and losses  including termination gains or losses  are included in the income statement when incurred 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
it also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
this pronouncement amended portions of sfas and was adopted by the company with sfas effective january  sfas  in part  allows special hedge accounting for cash flow hedges and provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the company has certain cash flow hedges in place natural gas costless collar arrangements  which were open as of january  when sfas and sfas became effective 
based upon the natural gas index pricing strip in effect as of january   the impact of these hedges at adoption would result in a charge to other comprehensive income of million net of the deferred tax benefit of million and the recognition of a derivative liability of million 
the company also entered into natural gas basis swaps covering essentially the same time period of the natural gas costless collars 
these transactions were executed in december  with settlement periods in under sfas  these basis swaps will not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  upon adoption these basis swaps would result in the recognition of derivative gains of million  recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of the deferred tax liability of million and a derivative receivable of million 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under the company s credit facility bear interest  at the election of the company  at i the greater of the agent bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  plus an applicable margin or ii the agent bank s eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
as a result  the company s annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
assuming no change in the amount outstanding during  the impact on interest expense of a ten percent change in the average interest rate would be approximately  as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value of the credit facility approximates the fair value
