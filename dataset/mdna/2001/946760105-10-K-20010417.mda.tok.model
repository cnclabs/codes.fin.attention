amortization during the fourth quarter of  the goodwill from the acquisition of software developers corporation sdc in june was evaluated and determined to be impaired and was adjusted accordingly  as a result of the company s ongoing evaluation of the realizability of such goodwill 
the goodwill was the result of excess purchase price over the net assets acquired from sdc 
there had been a decline in sales generated from the programmer s supershop catalog  which became more substantial in in  the customer list and catalog production and distribution processes were evaluated and the company determined the value previously recognized was impaired 
the customers buying patterns have changed based upon increased competition from other direct market resellers and the accessibility to procure software products through competing websites 
the impairment of goodwill was determined by analyzing the historical trends and future projections of the programmer s supershop catalog 
the number of customers mailed were reviewed and based upon the data it was evident the amount of catalogs mailed were declining 
additionally  the volume of catalog sales was analyzed and the sales amounts were decreasing 
gross profit dollars during the period were experiencing pricing pressures from competitors and increased distributors and websites to procure software products 
this is leading to decreasing gross profit dollars and increased catalog and production costs

projections of sales  gross profit and undiscounted cash flows were prepared using catalog mailing plans and historical data

certain factors affecting operating results this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
statements in this report regarding future events or conditions  including statements regarding industry prospects and the company s expected financial position  business and financing plans  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are set forth in the paragraphs below and are disclosed elsewhere in this report  and include risks and uncertainties related to the continued acceptance of the company s distribution channel by vendors and customers  the timely availability and acceptance of new products  and contribution of key vendor relationships and support programs  as well as factors that effect the software industry generally 
the company operates in a rapidly changing business  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
management cannot predict every risk factor  nor can it assess the impact  if any  of all such risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
of pages competition 
the direct marketing industry and the computer software distribution business  in particular  are highly competitive 
the company competes with consumer electronic and computer retail stores  including superstores  and other direct marketers of software and computer related products 
certain software vendors are selling their products directly through their own catalogs and over the internet 
certain competitors of the company have financial  marketing and other resources greater than those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market 
in addition  price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to increased price competition 
an increase in the amount of competition faced by the company or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations and seasonality 
the company s sales and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the condition of the software industry in general  shifts in demand for software products  industry shipments of new software products or upgrades  the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping and printing costs and in merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays  and changes in the company s product offerings 
the company s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  operating results may be materially adversely affected 
privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance 
the company mails catalogs and sends electronic messages to names in its proprietary customer database and to potential customers whose names are obtained from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
there has been increasing worldwide public concern regarding right to privacy issues involved with the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information 
any domestic or foreign legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting these practices could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management information systems 
the company s success is dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of its management information systems  including its telephone and internet systems 
the company s ability to manage its inventory and accounts receivable collections  to purchase  sell and ship its products efficiently and on a timely basis  and to maintain its operations is dependent upon the quality and effective utilization of the information generated from the management information systems 
the company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database 
in that regard  the company anticipates that it will  from time to time  require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems 
increases in postage  shipping and paper costs 
increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could have a significant impact on the cost of production and mailing of the company s catalogs and the shipment of customer orders 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically  and the company has no control over increases that may occur in the future 
paper prices historically have been cyclical and significant increases have been experienced by the company in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations  particularly to the extent the company is unable to pass on such increases directly to its customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
in addition  strikes or other service interruptions by the postal service or third party couriers could adversely affect the company s ability to deliver products on a timely basis 
page of pages new software releases 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected by a delay in the introduction of a major new software product or upgrading of more specialized products 
purchasers of software may delay the ordering of new software applications in the period immediately preceding such introduction for fear of technological obsolescence 
the company believes that software publishers often delay the release of related software products so as to coordinate with the release of these major new products or delay development of new products until after the importance of these new products can be evaluated 
delayed introductions of these new products could result in the delay or reduction of sales because the unreleased product cannot be delivered and could also adversely affect sales in that the company  which often coordinates new catalog drops and marketing initiatives with such introductions and product upgrades  would be focusing catalog marketing on such unreleased products 
changing methods of software distribution 
the software distribution industry is undergoing significant change and consolidation 
software distributors are consolidating operations and acquiring or merging with other distributors or retailers to achieve economies of scale and increased efficiency 
the current consolidation trend could cause the industry to become even more competitive and make it more difficult for the company to maintain its operating margins 
the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is also changing  and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand 
software developers and publishers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
the emergence of the internet as a viable platform in which to conduct business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customers access to products and information 
this transition has heightened the company s awareness to maintain a competitive edge in this market 
from time to time certain developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers 
while microsoft and other vendors currently sell their products directly to end users  they have not attempted to completely bypass the reseller channel 
future efforts by such entities to bypass third party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the company s operations 
in addition  certain major publishers  including microsoft  have implemented programs for the master copy distribution or site licensing of software 
these programs generally grant an organization the right to make a number of copies of software for distribution within the organization provided that the organization pays a fee to the developer for each copy made 
also  resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through downloading to end users microcomputers  through cd rom unlocking technology  through cd rom based subscription services and through on line shopping services 
any of these competitive programs  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition 
dependence upon vendors 
as is customary in the industry  the company has no long term supply contracts with any of its suppliers 
substantially all the company s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon days notice or less 
termination or interruption of the company s relationships with its suppliers or modification of the terms of or discontinuance of their agreements with the company could adversely affect the company s operating results 
page of pages certain of the products offered by the company might be subject to manufacturer allocations  which limit the number of units of manufacturers products available to resellers  including the company 
the company s business may be adversely affected if certain products become unavailable to the company or if the number of units allocated to the company becomes limited  whether such unavailability or limitation is due to the loss of authorized dealer status  allocation limitations or other conditions 
many key vendors finance portions of the cost of catalog publication and distribution based upon the amount of coverage given in the catalogs to their respective products 
a reduction in or discontinuation of this practice could have a material adverse effect on the company 
rapid changes in software products and risk of inventory obsolescence 
the software products industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to identify and obtain the right to market products that will meet the changing requirements of the marketplace 
the company has sought to minimize its inventory exposure through a variety of inventory control procedures and policies  including formal and informal vendor price protection programs 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain greater purchasing discounts  the company expects to carry increased inventory levels of certain products in the future 
in addition  large software firms continue to develop products that include the features of utility and subroutine products published and or sold by the company in their software languages  thus rendering certain of such products unnecessary 
additionally  if the growth rate of the personal computer market were to decrease  with a corresponding decrease in demand for computer software  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and offer products necessary to remain competitive or avoid losses related to obsolete inventory  or that unexpected new product introductions will not have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s inventory 
stock volatility 
the technology sector of the united states stock markets has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods 
numerous conditions  which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the company in particular  whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the company s operating performance  could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
furthermore  fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements regarding litigation  the loss of a significant vendor  increased competition  reduced vendor incentives and trade credit  higher postage and operating expenses  and other developments  could have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions strategy 
the company plans to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses 
however  there can be no assurance that suitable acquisitions will be available to the company on acceptable terms  that financing for future acquisitions will be available on acceptable terms  that future acquisitions will be advantageous to the company or that anticipated benefits of such acquisitions will be realized 
the pursuit  timing and integration of possible future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results 
state sales tax collection 
the company presently collects state sales tax  or other similar tax  only on sales of products to residents of the state of new jersey 
various states have tried to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales taxes on the sale of products shipped to state residents 
the united states supreme court has affirmed its position that it is unlawful for a state to impose state sales tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and subsequent delivery of purchased goods by parcel post and interstate common carriers 
however  it is possible that legislation may be passed to overturn such decision or the supreme court may change page of pages its position 
additionally  it is currently uncertain as to whether electronic commerce  which will likely include the company s internet sales activities  will be subject to state sales tax 
the imposition of new state sales tax collection obligations on the company in states to which it ships products would result in additional administrative expenses to the company and could result in price increases to the customer  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to its activities in the united states  of the company s sales were generated internationally 
prior to the sale by the company of its european based operations  the company was subject to general risks attendant to the conduct of business in each of the foreign countries where such european based operations were located  including economic uncertainties and foreign government regulations 
in addition  the company s international business was subject to changes in demand or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors 
in the normal course of operations  the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
market risk is defined for these purposes as the potential change in the fair value resulting from an adverse movement in interest rates 
as of december   the company terminated the borrowing agreement with pnc  and has subsequently replaced it with a loan agreement with hudson united bank  effective february   which bears interest at a variable rate based upon hudson s prime rate at march  plus 
information regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk related to a portion of the proceeds from the sale by the company of its european subsidiaries that is being held in escrow is set forth in part i  item of this annual report on form k under the heading foreign exchange
