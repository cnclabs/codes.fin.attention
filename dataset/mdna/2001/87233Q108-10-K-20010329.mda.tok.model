the remainder of the purchase price was funded with cash on hand 
for the year ended december   the partnership s general partner interest in northern border pipeline and general partner interest in tuscarora represent its only material assets 
business of northern border pipeline company general northern border pipeline is a general partnership formed in the general partners are tc pipelines and northern border partners  both of which are publicly traded partnerships 
each of tc pipelines and northern border partners holds its interest in northern border pipeline  and of voting power  respectively  through a subsidiary limited partnership 
the general partner of tc pipelines is tc pipelines gp  inc  a subsidiary of transcanada 
the general partners of northern border partners and its subsidiary limited partnership are northern plains natural gas company and pan border gas company  both subsidiaries of enron corp  and northwest border pipeline company  a subsidiary of the williams companies  inc northern border pipeline owns an interstate pipeline system that transports natural gas from the montana saskatchewan border to natural gas markets in the midwestern united states 
the northern border pipeline system connects with multiple pipelines that provide shippers with access to the various natural gas markets served by those pipelines 
in the year ended december   tc pipelines estimates that northern border pipeline transported approximately of the total amount of natural gas imported from canada to the united states 
over the same period  approximately of the natural gas transported was produced in the western canadian sedimentary basin located in the provinces of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan 
northern border pipeline transports gas for shippers under a tariff regulated by the ferc 
the tariff specifies the calculation of amounts to be paid by shippers and the general terms and conditions of transportation service on the pipeline system 
northern border pipeline derives revenue from agreements for the receipt and delivery of gas at points along the pipeline system as specified in each shipper s individual transportation contract 
northern border pipeline does not own the gas that it transports  and therefore it does not assume the related natural gas commodity risk 
the management of northern border pipeline is overseen by a four member management committee 
one representative is designated by tc pipelines  three representatives are designated by northern border partners  with each of its general partners selecting one representative 
voting power on the management committee is presently allocated among northern border partners three representatives in proportion to their general partner interests in northern border partners 
as a result  the voting power of northern border partners three representatives on the management committee is allocated as follows to the representative designated by northern plains  to the representative designated by pan border and to the representative designated by northwest border 
northern plains and pan border are subsidiaries of enron corp 
therefore  enron controls of the voting power of the management committee and has the right to select two of the members of the management committee 
the northern border pipeline system is operated by northern plains pursuant to an operating agreement 
as of december   northern plains employed approximately individuals located at the operating headquarters in omaha  nebraska  and at various locations along the pipeline route 
northern plains employees are not represented by any labor union and are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
the northern border pipeline system northern border pipeline owns a  mile united states interstate pipeline system that transports natural gas from the montana saskatchewan border near port of morgan  montana  to interconnecting pipelines in the upper midwest of the united states 
construction of the northern border pipeline system was initially completed in and was expanded and or extended in  and the northern border pipeline system has pipeline access to natural gas reserves in the western canadian sedimentary basin in the provinces of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan  as well as the williston basin in the united states 
the northern border pipeline system also has access to synthetic gas produced at the dakota gasification plant in north dakota 
for the year ended december   of the natural gas transported on the system  approximately was produced in canada  approximately was produced by the dakota gasification plant  and approximately was produced in the williston basin 
the northern border pipeline system consists of miles of inch diameter pipe designed to transport  million cubic feet per day mmcfd from the canadian border to ventura  iowa  inch diameter pipe and inch diameter pipe  each approximately miles in length  designed to transport  mmcfd in total from ventura  iowa to harper  iowa  and miles of inch diameter pipe and miles of inch diameter pipe designed to transport mmcfd from harper  iowa to a terminus near manhattan  illinois chicago area 
along the pipeline there are compressor stations with total rated horsepower of  and measurement facilities to support the receipt and delivery of gas at various points 
other facilities include four field offices and a microwave communication system with tower sites 
at its northern end  the northern border pipeline system is connected to transcanada s majority owned foothills pipe lines sask 
ltd 
system in canada  which is connected to transcanada s alberta system and the pipeline system owned by transgas limited in saskatchewan 
the alberta system gathers and transports approximately of the total north american natural gas production and approximately of the natural gas produced in the western canadian sedimentary basin 
the northern border pipeline system also connects with facilities of williston basin interstate pipeline at glen ullin and buford  north dakota  facilities of amerada hess corporation at watford city  north dakota and facilities of dakota gasification company at hebron  north dakota in the northern portion of the northern border pipeline system 
interconnects the northern border pipeline system connects with multiple pipelines that provide its shippers with access to the various natural gas markets served by those pipelines 
the northern border pipeline system interconnects with pipeline facilities of o northern natural gas company  an enron subsidiary  at ventura  iowa as well as multiple smaller interconnections in south dakota  minnesota and iowa  o natural gas pipeline company of america at harper  iowa  o midamerican energy company at iowa city and davenport  iowa and cordova  illinois  o alliant power company at prophetstown  illinois  o northern illinois gas company at troy grove and minooka  illinois  o midwestern gas transmission company near channahon  illinois  o anr pipeline company near manhattan  illinois  and o the peoples gas light and coke company near manhattan  illinois at the terminus of the northern border pipeline system 
the ventura  iowa interconnect with northern natural gas company functions as a large market center  where natural gas transported on the northern border pipeline system is sold  traded and received for transport to significant consuming markets in the midwest and to interconnecting pipeline facilities destined for other markets 
shippers the northern border pipeline system serves more than firm transportation shippers with diverse operating and financial profiles 
based upon shippers contractual obligations  as of december   of the firm capacity is contracted by producers and marketers 
the remaining firm capacity is contracted to local distribution companies  interstate pipelines and end users 
as of december   the termination dates of these contracts ranged from october  to december  and the weighted average contract life  based upon annual contractual obligations  was approximately six years with just under of capacity contracted through mid september based on their proportionate shares of capacity  as of december   the five largest shippers are pan alberta gas us inc  transcanada energy marketing usa  inc  pancanadian energy services inc  enron north america corp 
and engage energy us  lp 

the largest shippers  in total  are responsible for approximately of total revenues 
as of december   northern border pipeline s largest shipper  pan alberta  holds firm capacity of mmcfd under three contracts with terms to october  an affiliate of enron provides guaranties for mmcfd of pan alberta s contractual obligations through october  in addition  pan alberta s remaining capacity is supported by various credit support arrangements  including  among others  a letter of credit  a guaranty from an interstate pipeline company through october  for mmcfd  an escrow account and an upstream capacity transfer agreement 
mirant americas energy marketing  lp  formerly southern company energy marketing lp  manages the assets of pan alberta gas  ltd  which include pan alberta s contracts with northern border pipeline 
some of northern border pipeline s shippers are affiliated with the general partners of tc pipelines and northern border partners 
transcanada energy marketing usa  inc  a subsidiary of transcanada  holds firm contracts representing of capacity 
enron north america corp  a subsidiary of enron  holds firm contracts representing of capacity 
transcontinental gas pipe line corporation  a subsidiary of williams  holds a contract representing of capacity 
demand for transportation capacity northern border pipeline s long term financial condition is dependent on the continued availability of economic western canadian natural gas for import into the united states 
natural gas reserves may require significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production  gathering  storage  transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to pipelines that interconnect with the northern border pipeline system 
low prices for natural gas  regulatory limitations or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development of additional reserves and production  gathering  storage and pipeline transmission of western canadian natural gas supplies 
additional pipeline export capacity also could accelerate depletion of these reserves 
northern border pipeline s business depends in part on the level of demand for western canadian natural gas in the markets the pipeline system serves 
the volumes of natural gas delivered to these markets from other sources affect the demand for both western canadian natural gas and use of the northern border pipeline system 
demand for western canadian natural gas to serve other markets also influences the ability and willingness of shippers to use the northern border pipeline system to meet demand in the markets that the northern border pipeline system serves 
a variety of factors could affect the demand for natural gas in the markets that the northern border pipeline system serves 
these factors include o economic conditions  o fuel conservation measures  o alternative energy requirements and prices  o climatic conditions  o government regulation  and o technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices 
tc pipelines cannot predict whether these or other factors will have an adverse effect on demand for use of the northern border pipeline system or how significant that adverse effect could be 
future demand and competition on march   the ferc issued an order granting northern border pipeline s application for a certificate to construct and operate northern border pipeline s proposed project facilities 
project will expand and extend the northern border pipeline system into indiana 
project will afford shippers on northern border s extended pipeline system access to industrial gas consumers in northern indiana through an interconnect with northern indiana public service company  a major midwest local distribution company  at the terminus near north hayden  indiana 
the capital expenditures for project are estimated to be approximately million with a planned in service date of november proposed facilities include approximately miles of inch pipeline  new equipment and modifications at three compressor stations resulting in a net increase of  compressor horsepower  and one meter station 
as a result of the project expansion  the northern border pipeline system will have the ability to transport  mmcfd from ventura to harper  iowa  mmcfd from harper to manhattan  illinois  and mmcfd on the new extension from manhattan to north hayden  indiana 
five shippers have contracted for all the additional capacity under long term transportation agreements 
the project shippers are bethlehem steel corporation  el paso energy marketing company  northern indiana public service company  peoples energy services corporation and the peoples gas light and coke company 
northern border pipeline competes with other pipeline companies that transport natural gas from the western canadian sedimentary basin or that transport natural gas to markets in the midwestern united states 
the competitors for the supply of natural gas include six pipelines and the canadian domestic users in the western canadian sedimentary basin region 
northern border pipeline s competitive position is affected by the availability of canadian natural gas for export  the prices of natural gas in alternative markets  the cost of producing natural gas in canada  and demand for natural gas in the united states 
alliance pipeline  which commenced transporting natural gas from the western canadian sedimentary basin to the midwestern united states in december  delivers its volumes into the chicago market and other interstate pipelines 
alliance pipeline transports for its shippers gas containing high energy liquid hydrocarbons 
additional facilities to extract the natural gas liquids were constructed near alliance pipeline s terminus in chicago to permit alliance to transport natural gas with the liquids rich element 
as a consequence of alliance pipeline  there has been an increase in the volume of natural gas moving from the western canadian sedimentary basin to chicago 
vector pipeline lp interconnects with alliance and transports gas eastward to a terminus in eastern canada 
there are several additional projects proposed to transport natural gas from the chicago area that would provide access to additional markets for the shippers 
the proposed projects currently being pursued by third parties are targeting markets in northern illinois  wisconsin  and the northeast united states 
these proposed projects are in various stages of regulatory approval 
williams has a minority interest in alliance pipeline 
transcanada and other unaffiliated companies own and operate pipeline systems that transport natural gas from the same natural gas reserves in western canada that supply northern border pipeline s customers 
natural gas is also produced in the united states and transported by competing pipeline systems to the same destinations as the northern border pipeline system 
ferc regulation general northern border pipeline is subject to extensive regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the natural gas act 
under the natural gas act and the natural gas policy act  the ferc has jurisdiction with respect to virtually all aspects of the business  including o transportation of natural gas  o rates and charges  o construction of new facilities  o extension or abandonment of service and facilities  o accounts and records  o depreciation and amortization policies  o the acquisition and disposition of facilities  and o the initiation and discontinuation of services 
where required  northern border pipeline holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the ferc covering the facilities  activities and services 
under section of the natural gas act  the ferc has the power to prescribe the accounting treatment for items for regulatory purposes 
northern border pipeline s books and records are periodically audited under section the ferc regulates the rates and charges for transportation in interstate commerce 
natural gas companies may not charge rates exceeding rates judged just and reasonable by the ferc 
in addition  the ferc prohibits natural gas companies from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service 
some types of rates may be discounted without further ferc authorization 
northern border pipeline rate case proceeding in may  northern border pipeline filed a rate case wherein it proposed  among other things  to increase the allowed equity rate of return to 
the total annual cost of service increase due to the proposed changes was approximately million 
a number of the shippers and competing pipelines filed interventions and protests 
in june  the ferc issued an order in which the proposed changes were suspended until december   after which they were implemented with subsequent billings subject to refund 
the order set for hearing not only the proposed changes but also several issues raised by intervenors including the appropriateness of the cost of service form of tariff and the depreciation schedule 
upon a request for clarification  the ferc issued an order in august that provided the manner in which the costs of the recently completed expansion and extension project the chicago project could be recovered from shippers may be examined in this proceeding and that  while northern border pipeline had not proposed to change the depreciation rates approved in the last rate case  it had the burden of proving that the depreciation rates are just and reasonable 
on september   northern border pipeline filed a stipulation and agreement in its rate case proceeding that documented a settlement 
on december   the ferc issued its order approving the terms of the settlement 
one of the important elements of the settlement is the conversion of northern border pipeline s form of tariff from cost of service to stated rates based on a straight fixed variable rate design 
under the former cost of service tariff  the firm transportation shippers contracted to pay for a proportionate share of northern border pipeline s cost of service 
during any given month  each of these shippers paid a uniform mileage based charge for the amount of capacity contracted  and calculated under a cost of service tariff 
the shippers were obligated to pay their proportionate share of the cost of service regardless of the amount of natural gas they actually transported 
under the cost of service form of tariff  northern border pipeline could not charge or collect more than the cost of service 
under northern border pipeline s new form of tariff  shippers pay northern border pipeline on the basis of stated transportation rates 
under the terms of the settlement  and in accordance with straight fixed variable rate design principles  approximately of the agreed upon revenue level is attributed to demand charges 
the firm shippers are obligated to pay a monthly demand charge  regardless of the amount of natural gas they actually transport  for the term of their contracts 
the remaining of the agreed upon revenue level is attributed to the commodity charge based on the volumes of gas actually transported 
from december   through and including december   the rates were based upon an annual revenue level of million 
for periods after december   the rates are based upon an annual revenue level of million 
on a per unit of transportation basis  the rates under the new tariff are approximately equal to the cost of service on a per unit basis charged prior to december  the settlement also provides that neither northern border pipeline nor its existing shippers can seek rate changes until november   at which time northern border pipeline must file a new rate case 
prior to the new rate case  northern border pipeline will not be permitted to increase rates if its costs increase  nor will northern border pipeline be required to reduce rates based on cost savings 
northern border pipeline s earnings and cash flow will depend on its future costs  contracted capacity  the volumes of gas transported and its ability to recontract capacity at acceptable rates 
under northern border pipeline s previous cost of service tariff  the amount of revenue that northern border pipeline collected from customers generally declined as the rate base was recovered 
under its new tariff  northern border pipeline is entitled to collect revenue based on stated rates established in its rate case until its next rate case  which will be filed november  northern border pipeline will  however  continue to depreciate its rate base at an annual depreciation rate on transmission plant in service of and northern border pipeline s rate base in will be a factor in determining what northern border pipeline can charge when it files a new rate case at that time 
in order to avoid a decline in the revenue northern border pipeline can collect from its customers  northern border pipeline must maintain or increase its rate base by acquiring or constructing assets that replace or add to existing pipeline facilities or by adding new facilities and maintain its level of contracted capacity at the stated rates 
it was agreed in the settlement of the rate case  that there would be no project cost containment mechanism adjustment for the chicago project and that all costs as of november  incurred in the construction and commissioning of the chicago project be included in rate base 
the project cost containment mechanism was created in the settlement of the rate case 
the purpose of the project cost containment mechanism was to limit northern border pipeline s ability to include cost overruns for the chicago project in rate base and to provide incentives for cost underruns 
the settlement of northern border pipeline s rate case  provided that for at least seven years from the date the chicago project was completed  northern border pipeline could continue to calculate the allowance for income taxes in the manner it had historically used 
in addition  a settlement adjustment mechanism of million was implemented  which effectively reduces the return on rate base 
these provisions of the rate case were maintained in the settlement of northern border pipeline s rate case 
northern border pipeline also provides interruptible transportation service 
interruptible transportation service is transportation in circumstances when surplus capacity is available after satisfying firm service requests 
the maximum rate that may be charged to interruptible shippers is calculated as the sum of the firm transportation rate schedule t maximum reservation charge and commodity rate 
under northern border pipeline s previous cost of service form of tariff  all interruptible transportation service revenue generated was credited to the benefit of the firm shippers 
under northern border pipeline s new tariff  northern border pipeline shares net interruptible transportation service revenue and any new services revenue on an equal basis with northern border pipeline s firm shippers through october  in addition  northern border pipeline is permitted to retain revenue from interruptible transportation service to offset any decontracted firm capacity 
after october   all revenues from interruptible transportation service and other new services will no longer be subject to sharing and thus will be retained by northern border pipeline 
in addition  the settlement of the rate case also provided for an equal sharing with northern border pipeline s firm shippers of revenue generated from a certain telecommunications contract for the term of that contract 
northern border pipeline intends to develop new services and seek the ferc s authorization to implement such services 
while the receipt of those approvals and the future impact of the revenue sharing provisions of the settlement on northern border pipeline s earnings cannot be determined at this time  revenues from these sources are expected to be minimal through at least october  open access regulation beginning on april   the ferc issued a series of orders  known as order  which required pipeline companies to unbundle their services and offer sales  transportation  storage  gathering and other services separately  to provide all transportation services on a basis that is equal in quality for all shippers and to implement a program to allow firm holders of pipeline capacity to resell or release their capacity to other shippers 
capacity release provisions were adopted that allowed shippers to release all or part of their capacity either permanently or temporarily 
shippers on the northern border pipeline system have temporarily released capacity as well as permanently released capacity to other shippers who have agreed to comply with the underlying contractual and regulatory obligations associated with that capacity 
beginning in  the ferc issued a series of orders  referred to together as order  amending its open access regulations to standardize business practices and procedures governing transactions between interstate natural gas pipelines  their customers  and others doing business with the pipelines 
the intent of order was to assist shippers that deal with more than one pipeline by establishing standardized business practices and procedures 
these business standards  developed by the gas industry standards board  govern important business practices including shipper supplied service nominations  allocation of available capacity  accounting and invoicing of transportation service  standardized internet business transactions and capacity release 
northern border pipeline has implemented the necessary changes to its tariff and internal systems 
in  the ferc initiated a number of proceedings to further amend its open access regulations 
in the resulting order  order issued february   the ferc revised the short term transportation regulations by waiving the maximum rate ceiling in its capacity release regulations until september  for short term releases of capacity of less than one year  permitting value oriented peak off peak rates to better allocate revenue responsibility between short term and long term markets  permitting term differentiated rates to better allocate risks between shippers and the pipelines  revising the regulations related to scheduling procedures  capacity segmentation  imbalance management and penalties  retaining the right of first refusal and the five year matching cap but limiting the right to customers with maximum rate contracts for or more consecutive months of service  and adopting new reporting requirements to take effect september  that include reporting daily transactional data on all firm and interruptible contracts  daily reporting of scheduled quantities at points or segments  and the posting of corporate and pipeline organizational charts  names and functions 
as required by order no 
 northern border pipeline filed pro forma tariff sheets in compliance to address the issues identified in above 
this filing is pending at the ferc 
all other related compliance filings and reporting requirements have been completed and implemented 
tc pipelines does not believe these regulatory initiatives will have a material adverse impact to northern border pipeline s operations 
environmental and safety matters northern border pipeline s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to safety and the protection of the environment which include the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  clean air act  as amended  the clean water act  as amended  the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended  and the pipeline safety act of although tc pipelines believes that northern border pipeline s operations and facilities are in general compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and safety regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and tc pipelines cannot provide any assurances that northern border pipeline will not incur such costs and liabilities 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from northern border pipeline s operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to northern border pipeline 
if northern border pipeline is unable to recover such resulting costs  earnings and cash distributions could be adversely affected 
business of tuscarora gas transmission company tuscarora is a nevada general partnership that was formed in its general partners are tc tuscarora intermediate limited partnership  a direct subsidiary of tc pipelines  which holds a general partner interest  tuscarora gas pipeline co  a wholly owned subsidiary of sierra pacific resources company  which holds a general partner interest and tcpl tuscarora ltd  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of transcanada  which holds a general partner interest 
the management of tuscarora is overseen by a management committee that determines the policies of  has authority over the affairs of  and approves the actions of tuscarora 
the management committee participates in the management of the construction  maintenance and operation of the tuscarora pipeline system 
under the tuscarora partnership agreement  voting control is allocated among tuscarora s three general partners in proportion to their general partner interests in tuscarora 
as a result  tc pipelines has a voting interest  sierra pacific has a voting interest  and transcanada has a voting interest on the tuscarora management committee 
tuscarora gas operating company  a subsidiary of sierra pacific  operates the tuscarora pipeline system pursuant to an operating agreement 
the tuscarora pipeline system tuscarora owns a mile  inch diameter  united states interstate pipeline system that originates at an interconnection point with facilities of pg e gas transmission northwest near malin  oregon and runs southeast through northeastern california and northwestern nevada 
the tuscarora pipeline system terminates near reno  nevada at the tracy power plant 
deliveries are also made directly to the local gas distribution system of sierra pacific 
along its route  deliveries are made in oregon  northern california and northwestern nevada 
the tuscarora pipeline system was constructed in and was placed into service in december the tuscarora pipeline system has the capacity to transport  on a firm basis  approximately mmcfd 
tc pipelines believes that the tuscarora pipeline system has the potential to be economically expanded up to approximately mmcfd 
tuscarora has firm transportation contracts for over of its capacity  including a contract for of the capacity held by sierra pacific power company  a subsidiary of sierra pacific  which expires on november  as of december   the weighted average contract life on the tuscarora pipeline system was approximately years 
in december  tuscarora commenced construction of the hungry valley lateral  a mile  inch pipeline extension to serve as tuscarora s second connection into reno  nevada 
sierra pacific power holds firm capacity on the lateral for approximately mmcfd under a year firm transportation contract 
the project was completed in january at a capital cost of approximately million 
tuscarora s competitive position is dependent on the continued availability of economic western canadian natural gas for import into the united states and on the level of demand for western canadian natural gas in the markets the tuscarora pipeline system serves 
shippers of natural gas from the western canadian sedimentary basin have other options for transporting canadian natural gas to the united states  including transportation on pipelines eastward in canada or to markets on the west coast of the united states and canada 
similarly  natural gas produced in the united states serves the same markets as tuscarora in northern nevada 
however  tc pipelines believes tuscarora has a well diversified natural gas supply which allows it to transport both canadian and united states natural gas 
in  tuscarora embarked on a public solicitation for additional capacity on its system 
based on the results of the solicitation  tuscarora is currently evaluating expanding its pipeline system 
tc pipelines expects tuscarora to file an application in the first half of with the ferc for approval to expand the tuscarora pipeline system 
at this time  tc pipelines can give no assurance that tuscarora will decide to or be able to expand its pipeline system 
ferc regulation tuscarora is subject to regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the natural gas act  and is subject to the ferc s rules  regulations and accounting procedures 
tuscarora generates revenues from individual transportation contracts with shippers that provide for the receipt and delivery of natural gas at points along the tuscarora pipeline system 
tuscarora s transportation rates are based on its cost of service as approved by the ferc 
tuscarora s cost of service includes administrative and operating costs  depreciation and amortization  taxes other than income taxes  an allowance for income taxes and a regulated return on capital employed 
environmental and safety matters tuscarora s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to safety and protection of the environment 
tc pipelines believes that tuscarora s operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable united states environmental and safety regulations
