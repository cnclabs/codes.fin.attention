net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest and loan fee income on earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  is the principal source of earnings for the corporation 
throughout this discussion net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest were subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
the following table shows the allocation to assets  the source of funding and their respective interest spreads 
average net earning interest interest assets spread income dollars in thousands interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities and equity average net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities and equity average net earning interest interest assets spread income interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities and equity yield on earning assets net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and million in the decline from occurred because the rise in interest income was more than offset by the increase in interest expense 
specifically  interest income rose million while interest expense increased million 
the overall higher interest rate environment in  compared with the prior year  had the following effect on interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the average yield on earning assets rose basis points from to  resulting in million of additional interest income 
higher earning asset average balances added another million to interest income 
the combination of growth in outstandings and higher yields on loans comprised of the increase over while gains in securities volumes and yields added the remaining 
higher interest expense was also volume and rate driven as savings and money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and other borrowings were the main funding sources for the earning asset growth 
the cost of funds for the year  as a percentage of average earning assets  increased basis points from in to this year 
the following table illustrates the specific year over year impact to net interest income based on changes in the rate and volume components of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was compared to in and in as discussed previously  the decline in the net interest margin compared to last year was a result of the increase in earning asset yield and volume being outpaced by higher earning asset funding costs

service charges on deposits rose million or compared to last year 
much of this income is based on the number of accounts  competitive fees and customer checking account activity 
as stated in various places throughout this document  some portion of the increase between and prior balances is due to the may purchase accounting acquisition of cobancorp 
credit card fees rose million or in the increase was due to higher debit card volume  increased merchant activity and the maintenance of cash advance and late fees at competitive prices 
other operating income  as presented in the table  was up due to higher commissions on equity and insurance sales  higher letter of credit activity  increased factored accounts receivable business  higher cash management fees and a gain on the sale of an interest in certain leveraged leases

note to the consolidated financial statements also discusses merger related expenses in detail and summarizes their effect on other expenses  other income statement categories and the overall earnings of the corporation 
salaries  wages  pension and benefits totaled million in  a decrease of million or from the corresponding adjusted costs 
the decrease in salaries and wages were attributable to continued emphasis on efficiency and  to a lesser degree  relatively long replacement times due to another year of low unemployment rates in our operating areas 
continued cost discipline lowered operating costs during as follows equipment expense  other taxes  and stationary supplies postage declined million  in the aggregate  or  bankcard  loan processing and other fees dropped million  or  advertising was down million  or  telephone costs declined million  or  the fdic deposit based assessment was down million  or  and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased million  or

in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  securities have been classified as available for sale 
in this classification  adjustment to fair value of the securities available for sale in the form of unrealized holding gains and losses  is excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in a separate component of shareholders equity

residential loans family dwellings totaled billion  home equity loans million  construction loans million and commercial real estate loans billion 
commercial real estate loans include both commercial loans where real estate has been taken as collateral as well as loans for commercial real estate 
the majority of commercial real estate loans are to owner occupants where cash flow to service debt is derived from the occupying business cash flow instead of normal building rents 
these loans are generally part of an overall relationship with existing customers primarily within northeast ohio

the increase in consumer and commercial loans is evidence of firstmerit s shifting loan portfolio 
lease financing loans increased during auto leases totaled million with equipment leasing totaling million  leveraged leases were million and tax free leases were thousand at year end there is no concentration of loans in any particular industry or group of industries 
most of the corporation s business activity is with customers located within the state of ohio 
allowance for possible loan losses the corporation maintains what management believes is an adequate allowance for possible loan losses 
firstmerit and firstmerit bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowances through ongoing reviews of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  non performing assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio

successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiary bank  participating in approval of the largest loans  conducting reviews of loan portfolios  providing centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing loan workouts 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
the corporation adheres to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and statement no 
 an amendment of statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
these statements provide guidance for determining the allowance for loan loses related to impaired loans and illustrate the required financial statement disclosures for impaired loans 
impaired loans are loans for which current information or events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans must be valued based on the present value of the loans expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rates  at the loans observable market price  or the fair value of the loan collateral 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful

s and impaired loans as defined by statements and exclude certain consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases classified as non accrual 
consumer installment loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
credit card loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
when any other loan becomes days past due  it is placed on non accrual status unless it is well secured and in the process of collection 
any losses are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses as soon as they are identified 
non performing assets at year end were million  million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans outstanding plus ore  non performing assets were at year end and at december  and the average balances of impaired loans for the years ended and were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended  impaired assets earned million in interest income 
had they not been impaired  they would have earned million 
for the same period  total non performing loans earned million in interest income 
had they been paid in accordance with the payment terms in force prior to being considered impaired  on non accrual status  or restructured  they would have earned million 
in addition to non performing loans and loans days past due and still accruing interest  management identified potential problem loans totaling million at year end these loans are closely monitored for any further deterioration in the borrowers financial condition and for the borrowers ability to comply with terms of the loans 
deposits average deposits for totaled billion  an increase of and compared to and levels  respectively 
the acquisition of cobancorp was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
accordingly  average deposits for include deposits of cobancorp for approximately seven months while and averages include these deposits for a full year 
average demand accounts and savings balances were flat compared to average cds increased million largely due to higher rates being offered in with the exception of demand deposits  the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits  compared to the prior year  reflected the overall higher interest rate environment during the yields on interest bearing checking accounts declined as management intentionally lowered rates on these deposits 
the average rate paid on savings and money market accounts rose basis points to and the average yield paid on cds increased basis points to 
total demand deposits comprised of average deposits in compared with last year and in savings accounts  including money market products  made up of average deposits in compared to in and in cds accounted for of average deposits in  in and in the most notable shifts were increased savings and money market balances 
money market balances rose because of a broad product base and a higher rate environment 
increased cd outstandings occurred as cd specials were used at various times to decrease reliance on wholesale borrowings 
the average cost of deposits and other borrowings was up basis points compared to one year ago  or in compared to last year

amount maturing in under months to months to months over months interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy which provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies to trends within the financial markets and within the industry 
the analysis presented below divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion which it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that liabilities maturing within one year exceed assets maturing within the same period 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within days subsequent to year end  the corporation was in a liability sensitive position as illustrated in the following table over days days days days days year total interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings certificate and time deposits repos and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap market risk firstmerit is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee of firstmerit bank alco oversees financial risk management  establishing broad policies that govern a variety of financial risks inherent in the corporation s operations 
alco monitors firstmerit s interest rates and sets limits on allowable risk annually 
market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
firstmerit s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk on firstmerit s balance sheet consists of mismatches of maturity gaps and indices  and options risk 
maturity gap mismatches result from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios 
options risk exists in many of firstmerit bank s retail products such as prepayable mortgage loans and demand deposits 
options risk typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for firstmerit 
index mismatches occur when asset and liability portfolios are tied to different market indices which may not move in tandem as market interest rates change 
interest rate risk is monitored using gap analysis  earnings simulation and net present value estimations 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk in the balance sheet at a point in time 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of firstmerit s interest rate risk for earnings simulation for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down basis points

during  the corporation s directors increased the quarterly cash dividend  marking the nineteenth consecutive year of annual increases since the corporation s formation in the current quarterly cash dividend of has an indicated annual rate of per share 
over the past five years the dividend has increased at an annual rate of approximately 
liquidity the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system  along with unused wholesale sources of liquidity and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
firstmerit bank maintains sufficient liquidity in the form of short term marketable investments with a short term maturity structure  federal home loan bank of cincinnati borrowing capacity  a brokered certificate of deposit cd program  unused fed funds purchased capacity and cash flow from loan repayment 
in addition  the banking subsidiary is able to raise significant liquidity in the form of deposit gathering campaigns 
during  the corporation s indexed money market account  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of  increased by million 
the products pricing features limited disintermediation from other lower cost bank deposit products 
total money market accounts increased by million during on march   the corporation issued million of subordinated bank notes under a previously disclosed debt agreement 
the notes bear interest at and mature on april  under the agreement  the aggregate principal outstanding at any one time may not exceed billion 
the notes were offered only to institutional investors 
reliance on borrowed funds decreased during the year 
year end earning assets decreased million from year end while total deposits increased million  resulting in total borrowing decreasing million 
during the first half of the year the corporation reduced short term borrowings by increasing longer term brokered cds 
these cds reduced the corporation s reliance on short term sources of liquidity and increased available secured funding sources 
the increase in brokered cds was million 
during the year  the corporation sold  for liquidity purposes  approximately million of fixed rate manufactured housing loans 
additionally  approximately million of adjustable rate commercial real estate loans were sold 
the loan sales improved liquidity while improving the mix of the loan portfolio 
the liquidity needs of the parent company  primarily cash dividends  the stock repurchase programs and other corporate purposes  are met through cash  short term investments  dividends from the banking subsidiary  and revolving lines of credit 
the lines of credit are repaid with earnings from the banking subsidiary 
the two line of credit facilities have the following terms the total line of credit is million  decreased million in  the amount outstanding at year ends and were million and million  respectively  the interest rate at year end would have been  and at december   and the interest rate structure is variable based on one month libor plus basis points in and variable based on one month libor plus basis points in  and the total line of credit is million  an increase of million in  the amount outstanding at year ends and were million and million  respectively  the interest rate at december  was and one year ago  and the variable interest rate structure is based on one month libor plus basis points 
management is not aware of any trend or event  other than noted in this section or in other sections within this report  which would result in  or is reasonably likely to result in  a material increase or decrease in the corporation s liquidity 
regulation and supervision a strict uniform system of capital based regulation of financial institutions became effective on december  under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
at year end  the corporation and its subsidiaries all exceeded the minimum capital levels of the well capitalized category 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this annual report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes
