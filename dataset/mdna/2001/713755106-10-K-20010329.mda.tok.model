lastly  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior notes in may on march   we entered into an million revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks that replaced our existing million credit facility 
in addition  we entered into a million working capital line of credit with the lead bank of the group 
collectively  these two facilities are referred to as the credit facility 
the credit facility expires in march approximately million was outstanding under the credit facility at december  the credit facility also allows the issuance of up to million of standby letters of credit 
at december   we were liable for approximately million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce amounts available under the credit facility 
at december   we had million available under the credit facility  subject to compliance with customary borrowing conditions 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a spread over libor  which varies based on the ratio of our funded debt to total capital 
at december   borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at per annum 
additionally  the credit facility requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the credit agreement 
on march   one of our subsidiaries issued million of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds to finance the construction of a produce processing facility 
approximately million of the proceeds from these bonds had been used as of december  interest on these bonds varied as determined by the remarketing agent for the bonds and was approximately per annum at december  the bonds were secured by a letter of credit issued by a commercial bank and mature in march on january   these bonds were refinanced with the proceeds of million taxable revenue bonds issued by fresh advantage  inc  one of our subsidiaries  in order to free us from certain restrictive covenants applicable to issuers of tax exempt bonds 
like the tax exempt bonds  these taxable bonds bear interest at a variable rate determined by a remarketing agent  are secured by a letter of credit issued by a commercial bank  and mature in march during the third quarter of  we increased our master operating lease facility from million to million 
this facility is being used to construct four distribution centers 
two of these distribution centers became operational in early  one became operational in the second quarter of  and the remaining property is scheduled to become operational in the second quarter of under this facility  the lessor owns the distribution centers  incurs the related debt to construct the properties and thereafter leases each property to us 
we have entered into leases for three of the properties and have also entered into a commitment to lease the fourth property for a period beginning upon completion of that property 
all of these leases end on september   including extensions 
upon the expiration of the leases  we may seek to renew the leases 
if we are unable to or choose not to renew the leases  we have the option of selling the properties to third parties or purchasing the properties at their original cost 
if the properties are sold to third parties for less than of their aggregate original cost  we are obligated  under a residual value guarantee  to pay the lessor an amount equal to the shortfall 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the leases or sell the properties to third parties  and we will require substantial additional financing if we are required to purchase these properties upon the expiration of the master operating lease facility 
because of the location and condition of each property  we believe that the fair value of the properties included in this facility could eliminate or substantially reduce our exposure under the residual value guarantee  although there can be no assurance that we will not be required to make payments to satisfy this guarantee 
through december   construction expenditures by the lessor under this facility were approximately million 
on june   we entered into a million master operating lease facility to construct or purchase various office buildings and distribution centers 
as of december   one distribution center had been purchased and construction of one office building and one distribution center had begun under this facility 
under this facility  the lessor owns the properties  incurs the related debt to construct or purchase the properties and thereafter leases each property to us 
we have entered into a commitment to lease each property for a period beginning upon the completion of construction or acquisition of that property and ending on june  upon the expiration of the leases  we may seek to renew the leases 
if we are unable to or choose not to renew the leases  we have the option to sell the properties to third parties or purchase the properties at their original cost 
if the properties are sold to third parties for less than of their aggregate original cost  we are obligated  under a residual value guarantee  to pay the lessor an amount equal to the shortfall 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the leases or sell the properties to third parties  and we will require substantial additional financing if we are required to purchase these properties upon the expiration of the master operating lease facility 
because of the location and condition of the existing property  we believe that the anticipated fair value of the property could eliminate or substantially reduce our exposure under the residual value guarantee with respect to that property 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to make payments to satisfy this guarantee either with respect to the existing property or any other properties which may be constructed or purchased in the future under this facility 
through december   construction expenditures by the lessor under this facility were approximately million 
in may  we issued million of unsecured senior notes in a private placement 
these notes are due may  interest is payable semi annually 
the senior notes require the maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the note agreements 
proceeds of the issue were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes 
we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities and our master operating lease facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we will likely require additional sources of financing to the extent that we make additional acquisitions in the future

we will be required to adopt the provisions of these standards with our fiscal year beginning on december  management believes the effect of the adoption of these standards on us will be limited to financial statement presentation and disclosure and will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
quarterly results and seasonality set forth below is certain summary information with respect to our operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters 
historically  the restaurant and foodservice business is seasonal  with lower sales in the first quarter 
consequently  we may experience lower net sales during the first quarter  depending on the timing of any acquisitions 
management believes our quarterly net sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonality of the restaurant business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are related to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
our primary interest rate risk is from changing interest rates related to our long term debt 
we currently manage this risk through a combination of fixed and floating rates on these obligations 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt but impact earnings and cash flows  assuming other facts remain constant 
as of december   our total debt consisted of fixed and floating rate debt of million and million  respectively 
substantially all of our floating rate debt is based on libor 
at december   the fair market value of our fixed rate debt was approximately million 
holding other variables constant  such as debt levels  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the earnings and cash flow impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately  holding other variables constant 
from time to time  we use forward swap contracts for hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing fuel prices 
these contracts are recorded using hedge accounting 
under hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the hedge is deferred and recorded as a component of the underlying expense 
as of december   we had no outstanding forward swap contracts
