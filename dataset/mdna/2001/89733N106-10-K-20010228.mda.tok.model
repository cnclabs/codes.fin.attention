our net sales were million for the fiscal year ended november   with million attributable to financial payment solutions and million attributable to connectivity products and software 
net sales in the fiscal year ended november  decreased by million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended november  this cumulative decrease in net sales represents a million decrease in sales of our laser printers  impact printers and services  which was partially offset by an increase of million in sales of our proprietary imaging supplies and an increase of million in sales of our connectivity products  which includes million in software licensing revenue 
net sales were not significantly affected by price changes 
the decrease in our net sales for the fiscal year ended november   as compared to net sales for the fiscal year ended november   can be attributed to a significant non recurring replacement order of financial document printers to comark  inc of million recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as the implementation of our strategy to shift our focus away from our established financial payment solutions and toward our electronic payment solutions and wireless printing opportunities 
in connection with our shift in focus  we may continue to license our software technology to third parties as we consider appropriate 
to the extent that our mix of revenue sources continues to shift toward sales of connectivity products and technology licensing  our net sales could vary from historical patterns

in connection with our shift in focus  we intend to continue to invest in marketing expenditures  substantially increase the size of the sales force  and add technical resources as required 
as a result of these expenditures and hiring initiatives  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to exceed historical levels 
this forward looking statement will be impacted by the timing and amount of these expenditures  our ability to attract and retain sales and marketing personnel and the associated costs of such personnel  and the success of our marketing efforts

after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments  income taxes as a percentage of pretax income decreased to in the fiscal year ended november  from in the fiscal year ended november  backlog we sell our products on a purchase order basis rather than through long term contracts 
because we typically ship product within days of order and customers may cancel or reschedule deliveries  we do not consider backlog to be a reliable indicator of future financial results 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in july   our primary source of liquidity was through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in the fiscal year ended november  compared to million provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended november  this increase was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in inventories  prepaid expenses and other  and a decrease in income taxes payable 
the accounts receivable decrease resulted primarily from collections 
the increase in inventories resulted primarily from increased levels to meet anticipated sales

in connection with the general line of credit agreement  we have a  standby letter of credit sublimit agreement of which  was outstanding at november  there were no borrowings outstanding against either line of credit on november   and as of that date  million was available under the general line of credit and all million was available under the acquisition line of credit 
the acquisition line of credit expires on october  the general line of credit has no expiration date 
we believe that cash generated by operating activities  the net proceeds from our initial public offering and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for at least the next months 
to the extent that the funds generated from these sources are insufficient to finance our operating activities  we would need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

the new standard is effective for fiscal years starting after june  and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  our exposure to market risk is through our investments in available for sale securities and our bank debt which bears interest at variable rates 
available for sale securities consist of corporate debt and marketable equity securities 
approximately million of these securities have contractual maturity dates of up to one year and million of these securities have no maturity dates 
at november   market values approximated carrying values 
due to the short term maturities of these securities  management believes that there is no significant market risk 
at november   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities  and  accordingly  a sustained decrease in the rate of interest earned of would cause a decrease in the amount of interest earned of  the bank debt is a revolving line of credit 
all borrowings bear interest based upon the reference rate per annum as announced by the bank at november  
at november   there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit agreement and  accordingly  a sustained increase in the reference rate of would not cause our annual interest expense to change
