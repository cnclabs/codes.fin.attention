item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared with net sales have remained essentially unchanged in compared with net sales were  million in compared with  million for three factors that impacted revenues during were 
the volume of steam coal sold increased by percent in compared to 
the volume of the higher priced metallurgical coal declined by percent in compared to 
the average realized prices for both steam and metallurgical coal declined by percent in compared with the metallurgical coal market continued to be adversely affected by a weak coal export market and the slow recovery of the domestic steel market 
demand was weak for united states coal exported to foreign markets as the us dollar remained strong 
the market for steam coal continued to be adversely impacted by two factors mild weather and competition from western coals  which increased its penetration of traditional eastern coal market areas 
other revenue  which consists of royalties  rentals  miscellaneous income and gains on the sale of non strategic assets  increased percent to million for compared with million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in income from dispositions of non strategic mineral reserves which generated million in compared with million in as part of its management of coal reserves  massey regularly sells non strategic reserves or exchanges them for reserves located in more synergistic locations 
cost of sales increased percent to million for from million in this was primarily due to the increase in tons sold by percent from million tons in to million tons in cost of sales for includes a million credit related to refunds of black lung excise taxes paid on coal export sales tonnage 
the payment of black lung excise taxes on exported coal was determined to be unconstitutional by a federal district court decision 
during  the internal revenue service issued procedures for obtaining refunds related to such excise taxes 
cost of sales also included charges of million related to a geological impairment related to the longwall development at the upper cedar grove mine and a million charge related to a slurry spill from the impoundment breach at martin county coal corporation 
cost of sales on a per ton of coal sold basis  excluding the aforementioned items  increased by approximately percent in compared with as operational problems and adverse geologic conditions encountered during the third and fourth quarters of more than offset cost reductions that had been achieved in the first two quarters of depreciation  depletion and amortization slightly increased to million for from million in the increase of million was primarily due to capital expenditures made in recent years 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to million for compared with million for  due in part to a million bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of a major steel industry customer offset some by a reduction in accruals related to long term executive compensation plans 
interest income increased to million for compared with million for this increase of million was primarily due to the additional interest income of million related to the black lung excise tax refunds discussed above and a general increase in the floating interest rate on a note receivable from fluor corporation 
income taxes decreased percent to million for compared with million in the decrease primarily reflects the decreased earnings in compared with  partially offset by a rise in the effective tax rate to percent for compared with percent for compared with net sales for decreased percent to  million from  million for sales decreased million in compared with primarily due to the combination of a reduction in volume of the higher priced metallurgical coal and a decline in prices 
metallurgical coal volume decreased nearly percent during compared with this decrease was more than offset by an increase in lower priced steam coal volume 
also contributing to the decline in coal revenues were lower realized prices for both steam and metallurgical coal 
steam coal prices declined percent while metallurgical coal prices declined percent 
the metallurgical coal market was adversely affected by steel imports from outside the united states and a weak us coal export market 
the imports reduced demand for steel produced in the us and thereby reduced us demand for metallurgical coal  which is used in steel production 
demand was weak for us coal exported to foreign markets as the us dollar was strong and the asian economies slowly recover from their financial crises 
additionally  the market for steam coal continued to be impacted by two factors a mild winter in and competition from western coals  which have continued to penetrate the traditional eastern coal market areas 
other revenue  which consists of royalties  rentals  miscellaneous income and gains on the sale of non strategic assets  increased percent to million for compared with million for the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in rebates received from railroads 
cost of sales decreased percent to million for from million in as a result of lower production costs 
cost reductions were achieved which lowered the cost per ton of coal sold during the period by percent from per ton in to in massey continues to focus on reducing mining production costs through expansion of its surface mining capabilities and utilization of longwall mining 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased percent to million for from million in the increase of million was primarily due to the start up of appalachian synfuel  llc s synthetic fuel plant and the development of a new surface mine and a new longwall mine 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to million for compared with million for as a result of a long term retention agreement negotiated with massey s chief executive officer 
interest income decreased to million for compared with million for this decrease of million was primarily due to a lower outstanding balance on the note receivable from fluor caused by capital spending exceeding cash generated from operations 
income taxes decreased percent to million for compared with million in the million decrease reflects decreased earnings in compared with the effective tax rate was percent for compared with percent for liquidity and capital resources massey s cash and cash equivalents were million at october  the cash flow provided by operating activities was million in and million in and million in cash provided by operating activities reflects net earnings adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the cash used in investing activities reflects expenditures for replacement of mining equipment  the expansion of mining capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of mining operations 
financing activities primarily reflect changes in the note receivable from fluor 
immediately subsequent to the spin off  massey had million in debt 
fluor s previously issued million of senior notes due march  remained an obligation of massey following the spin off 
in addition  massey has a commercial paper program that provides up to million of operating liquidity 
massey has million day and million year revolving credit facilities that serve to provide liquidity backstop to massey s commercial paper program and are also available to meet the company s ongoing liquidity needs 
as of the spin off  massey s commercial paper borrowings were million 
massey generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures from cash generated from operations 
massey believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and anticipated dividend payments for at least the next several years 
nevertheless  the ability of massey to satisfy its debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond massey s control 
massey frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
in the past  massey has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations  but massey may consider a variety of other sources  depending on the size of any transaction  including debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital resources will be available to massey on terms which massey finds acceptable  or at all 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on massey s results of operations for the years presented 
new accounting standards accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
which deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  massey will adopt sfas no 
in the first fiscal quarter of massey believes that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on massey s financial position  results of operations or liquidity  however  the fasb continues to finalize and release interpretive guidance and  therefore  no assurance can be given that any new interpretive guidance  if contrary to massey s current interpretation of sfas no 
 will not have significant impact on massey 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk massey s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   massey had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments 
massey s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its commercial paper program 
at december   massey has an aggregate of million in commercial paper outstanding 
massey s commercial paper bore interest at an average rate of at december  based on the commercial paper balance outstanding at december   a basis point increase in the average issuance rate for massey s commercial paper would increase massey s annual interest expense by approximately million 
the fair value of massey s financial instruments is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
almost all of massey s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
massey has not engaged in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions
