overview backweb is a leading provider of internet communication infrastructure software and application specific software that enables companies to communicate business critical  time sensitive information to their customers  partners and employees 
we were incorporated on august  and commenced our operations in november during the period from commencement of operations through december   we were in a development stage and had insignificant revenues 
operating activities during this period related primarily to developing our products  building our corporate infrastructure and raising capital 
in december  we shipped the first commercial version of our software 
in august  in an effort to expand the features and functionalities of our product offerings  we acquired all the outstanding shares of lanacom inc  a canadian corporation 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair value on the acquisition date 
the purchase price of million was determined based on the value of shares originally issued and options granted 
of the total purchase price  approximately million was allocated to goodwill  representing the excess of the aggregate purchase price on the fair value of tangible and intangible assets 
the remainder of the purchase price was allocated to net tangible liabilities assumed  developed technology  and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill  developed technology and other identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life which ranges from to months 
the first backweb product  version  incorporating lanacom s headliner product  was released in january in early  we engaged in a comprehensive re examination of our business strategy and changed our strategic focus from a consumer oriented to an enterprise oriented internet communication company 
in connection with this change in strategy  we undertook a fundamental repositioning and reorganization of our work force  particularly in our sales organization 
during  we continued to enhance our infrastructure software  backweb foundation version  and in december released our first packaged application  backweb sales accelerator 
since our inception  revenues have been derived primarily from the licensing of our products and to a lesser extent from maintenance  consulting and training services 
the rate of growth of our service revenue is not commensurate with the costs of service revenues such as salaries and related expenses of our customer support and consulting organizations and cost of third party contractors to provide consulting services 
accordingly  our gross margins on service revenue are significantly lower than our gross margins on license revenue 
our products are marketed worldwide through a combination of the direct sales force  reseller channel  system integrators and oem s 
on june   backweb completed its acquisition of the software and intellectual property owned  licensed or developed by mobix communications ltd 
for an aggregate amount of million pursuant to a software and asset purchase agreement among the company  mobix and the principal shareholder of mobix 
backweb allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired to the following identifiable intangible assets million to in process research and development ipr d  million to goodwill and million to assembled work force and to other intangibles 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use  therefore  backweb expensed the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d of approximately million as of the date of the acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the capitalized intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their extended useful lives of two to three years 
we recognize software license revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
we have also adopted sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  for all transactions entered into after january  sop requires that revenue be recognized under the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and no vsoe exists for the delivered elements 
the company adopted staff accounting bulletin sab issued by the securities and exchange commission with effect from the fourth quarter of the year ending december  the adoption of sab did not have and is not expected to have a material effect of the company s consolidated balance sheets or results of operations 
to date  the company has derived its revenue from license fees of its products  maintenance  training and rendering of consulting services 
the company sells its products primarily through its direct sales force  resellers and oems 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we generally do not grant a right of return to our customers 
when a right of return exists  we defer revenue until the right of return expires  at which time revenue is recognized provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop maintenance revenue included in these arrangements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 
the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements maintenance  training and consulting services is determined based on the price charged for the undelivered element when sold separately 
license revenues are comprised of perpetual or time based license fees that are primarily derived from contracts with corporate customers and resellers  and royalty fees earned upon shipment of products which incorporate the company s software 
revenues on contracts with resellers are not recognized until software is sold through to the end user 
royalty revenues are recognized when reported to the company after shipment of the related products 
service revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from standard maintenance agreements  consulting and training fees 
customers licensing our products generally purchase the standard annual maintenance agreement for the products 
revenues from maintenance agreements are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the maintenance period 
consulting services are billed at an agreed upon rate plus out of pocket expenses and training services on a per session basis 
we recognize service revenues from consulting and training when provided to the customer 
we have expended significant sums since inception on product development and enhancement of sales and marketing capabilities  and expect that these expenditures will continue to increase as we pursue the emerging opportunities in our markets 
the functional currency of our operations is the us dollar  which is the primary currency in the economic environment in which we conduct our business 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses in israel is incurred in new israeli shekel nis 
the results of our operations are subject to fluctuations in the us dollar nis exchange rate  which is influenced by various global economic factors including inflation in israel

for the twelve months ended december   other income was million compared to million and  in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively

income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of israeli net operating loss carryforwards and million of us federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the us net operating loss carryforwards expire in various amounts between the years and the israeli net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date

as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing additional international operations and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to hire and expand our sales  maintenance  marketing and product development organizations  to expand marketing programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and for other general corporate activities 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of december   the company had  in an unused  available line of credit facility 
effective corporate tax rates our tax rate will reflect a mix of the us statutory tax rate on our us income  versus european country tax rates on our individual european country income and the israeli tax rate discussed below 
we expect that most of our taxable income will be generated in israel 
israeli companies are generally subject to income tax at the rate of of taxable income 
the majority of our income  however  is derived from our company s capital investment program with approved enterprise status under the law for the encouragement of capital investments  and is eligible therefore for tax benefits 
as a result of these benefits  we will have a tax exemption on income derived during the first two years in which this investment program produces taxable income  provided that we do not distribute such income as a dividend  and a reduced tax rate of for the next to years  depending upon the proportion of foreign ownership of the company 
all of these tax benefits are subject to various conditions and restrictions 
see israeli taxation and investment programs law for the encouragement of capital investments act there can be no assurance that we will obtain approval for additional approved enterprise programs  or that the provisions of the law will not change 
since we have incurred tax losses through december   we have not yet used the tax benefits for which we are eligible 
see item  business risk factors 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations most of our sales are in us dollars 
however  a large portion of our costs are incurred in relation to our operations in israel 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses  primarily our research and development costs  are denominated in nis 
costs not denominated in us dollars are translated to us dollars  when recorded  at prevailing rates of exchange 
this is done for the purposes of our financial statements and reporting 
costs not denominated in us dollars will increase if the rate of inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the israeli currency as compared to the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluations lags considerably behind inflation 
consequently  we are and will be affected by changes in the prevailing nis us dollar exchange rate 
we might also be affected by the us dollar exchange rate to the major european and asian currencies due to the fact that we operate offices throughout europe and asia 
the annual rate of inflation in israel was in  in and in the nis was devalued against the us dollar by approximately in  in and in the representative dollar exchange rate for converting the nis to us dollars  as reported by the bank of israel  was nis for one us dollar on december  recent accounting pronouncements as of july   the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure such instruments at fair value 
because backweb currently holds no derivative financial instruments as defined by sfas and does not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on backweb s financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the sfas issued fas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of fasb statement no 
 fas revises the standards of accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain additional disclosures  although it continues most of the provisions of fas without consideration 
the provisions of fas are effective for periods beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of the provisions of fas to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in israel and canada and sell them in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as most of our sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  the company does not anticipate material losses in these areas 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
