quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the fund is subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates with respect to its investments in debt securities and its outstanding debt payable  as well as changes in marketable equity security prices 
the fund does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
the return on the fund s investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
the fund s investment in portfolio securities consists of some fixed rate debt securities 
since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate  changes in interest rates do not directly impact interest income 
in addition  changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in the fund s determination of fair value of these debt securities 
the fund s debt securities are generally held to maturity and their fair values are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
borrowings under the fund s million line of credit expose the fund to certain market risks 
based on the average outstanding borrowings under the line of credit for the year ended december  of approximately  a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately  this change would have resulted in a change of in the net asset value per share 
the fund did not enter into its credit facility for trading purposes and the line of credit carries interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either the prime rate or the day libor rate 
a portion of the fund s investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies 
the fund would anticipate no impact on these investments from modest changes in public market equity prices 
however  should significant changes in market equity prices occur  there could be a longer term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains realized on these investments 
a portion of the fund s investment portfolio also consists of common stocks in publicly traded companies 
these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk  in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities
