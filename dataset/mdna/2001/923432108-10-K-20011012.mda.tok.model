this md a contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth herein  including those set forth in factors affecting future results below 
beginning with fiscal  the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday nearest to june for fiscal  the company s fiscal year was the week period ending on the sunday closest to june overview verilink corporation the company develops  manufactures  and markets a broad range of integrated access products and customer premises equipment cpe for use by telecommunication network service providers and corporate end users 
the company focuses on providing equipment that links service providers  such as network service providers nsps  to their enterprise customers 
the company s products enable connections at broadband access transmission speeds of t  nxt  digital subscriber line dsl  and various optical carrier speeds fiber with access services and protocols such as internet ip  ethernet  frame relay  and asynchronous transfer mode atm 
the company s customers include equipment integrators  service providers  and enterprise customers consisting of wireline and wireless carriers  inter exchange carriers ixcs  regional bell operating companies rbocs  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  internet service providers isps  and local  state  and federal government agencies 
the company was founded in san jose  california in and is a delaware corporation 
verilink s as product line continued in fiscal to generate the majority of sales 
the company designed the as with modular hardware and software to enable its customers to access increased network capacity and to adopt new communications services in a cost effective manner 
the as provides integrated access to low speed services  fractional t e services  and t  e  t  and frame relay services 
the wansuite product family is a full line of access devices ranging from csu dsus to software programmable intelligent integrated access devices with integrated routing and multi tier reporting 
the wansuite product family is powered by industry standard microprocessors that increase processing power over traditional termination devices by a factor of to times  depending upon the application 
the company also sells single purpose network access devices for selected applications 
through agreements entered into with beacon telco  lp and the boston university photonics center in fiscal  the company began development of optical access broadband solutions that will allow service providers to provide optical network access products to their enterprise customers 
in october  the company suspended the optical network access project 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company acquired txport  inc  a manufacturer of high speed voice and data communications products  based in huntsville  alabama 
accordingly  the results of operations of txport have been included in the company s results of operations beginning november   the date of acquisition 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the company s results of operations have and may continue to fluctuate from period to period in the future 
results of operations sales fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands net sales    percentage change from preceding year net sales for fiscal decreased to  from net sales of  in fiscal this decrease in net sales resulted from a decrease in sales volume to most of the company s product markets 
carrier and carrier access products net sales  primarily as products  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and enterprise access products decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these decreases were primarily a result of reduced spending by our large telecommunication infrastructure customers  which we believe to be a result of both economic and industry wide factors  including over capacity in our customers markets 
in the short term  the company anticipates that reduced capital spending by our customers may continue to affect sales  although forecasting is challenging in the current environment 
these large infrastructure customers have traditionally contributed more than half of the company s revenue base 
net sales for increased from to  the sales contribution of products acquired from txport for a full twelve months in fiscal compared to months in accounted for all this increase  offset by lower sales to worldcom in fiscal sales from the txport products represented approximately   and of sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal  shipments of the as product line accounted for approximately of net sales compared to during and in the company s business is characterized by a concentration of sales to a limited number of key customers 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for   and of sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company s largest customers in fiscal were nortel networks  ericsson  worldcom  interlink communications systems  and verizon 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and factors affecting future results customer concentration 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers  system integrators  value added resellers  and distributors 
sales to value added resellers and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in fiscal  as compared to approximately in and in to date  sales outside of north america have not been significant 
however  the company intends to expand the marketing of its products to markets outside of north america 
gross profit fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands gross profit    percentage of sales gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal year was due to significantly lower sales volume and the impact of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead 
the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal was a result of a number of factors  but was primarily attributable to the impact of the restructuring and consolidation plan completed during that year 
however  fiscal gross margins were impacted negatively by the mix of product sales  unabsorbed manufacturing overhead associated with the san jose facility before the restructuring  and additional warranty costs associated with the agreement the company reached with a customer to share in the expense associated with correcting a problem involving one of the company s products installed in the field 
in future periods  the company s gross profit will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the cost of products manufactured at subcontract facilities  the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  the mix of products sold  price competition  increases in material costs  and changes in other components of cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands research and development    percentage of sales research and development r d expenses increased to  or of sales in fiscal compared to  or of sales in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the new optical network access development project initiated in october that is discussed below  as well as an increase in spending for wansuite product enhancements 
the increase in r d expense in fiscal year as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal was due to the increase in actual expenses on a lower sales volume 
the expense decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to the restructuring and consolidation plan completed during fiscal  and to refocusing r d resources to key product development activities such as wansuite 
the decrease in r d expenses in fiscal as a percentage of sales was due to the lower spending at higher sales volumes 
in october  the company entered into agreements with beacon telco  lp and the boston university photonics center to establish a product development center at the photonics center to develop new optical network access products 
as part of the agreements  the company issued beacon telco warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
beacon telco exercised warrants for  shares in february the remaining warrants become exercisable over time  subject to acceleration based upon meeting development milestones and certain other events  including the market price of the company s common stock exceeding a certain price  and will expire on october  based upon milestones achieved during the fiscal year  warrants for  shares will become exercisable in april subject to the acceleration clauses in the agreements 
the agreements provide beacon telco the opportunity to receive two bonus payments  totaling up to  based in part on meeting certain milestones and the market price of the company s common stock 
see subsequent events and liquidity below 
the company recorded a non cash charge to research and development expenses in fiscal of  for the warrants and the first bonus payment used in the exercise of warrants for  shares 
the second bonus  of up to  is payable in full upon the completion of the final milestone in the optical network access project  or if the agreements are terminated  a pro rata portion is payable based on the extent to which the milestones have been completed 
additionally  the second bonus will be reduced if the price of the company s common stock is below per share at the time the bonus payment is made 
the company accrues the pro rata portion of the second bonus related to a milestone in the period that the milestone is achieved 
this bonus accrual is adjusted in subsequent periods for changes  either increases or decreases  in the closing market price of the company s common stock when the price is below per share 
for fiscal  research and development expenses include  for the accrual of the pro rata portion of the second bonus related to the milestones achieved during the fiscal year and based upon the closing market price of the company s common stock on june  of per share 
the company considers product development expenditures to be important to future sales  but expects research and development expenditures to decrease in fiscal  while such expenditures as a percentage of sales may vary 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
see factors affecting future results dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands selling  general and administrative 
   percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to  or of sales in fiscal from  or of sales in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal was due to lower variable sales compensation on lower sales volume  cost reduction programs implemented during the year that included a headcount reduction in march and that eliminated or curtailed substantially all discretionary spending  and the impact of the plan that consolidated the company in huntsville completed during fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales in fiscal was due entirely to lower sales volume 
sg a decreased slightly in fiscal to  from  in fiscal due to several factors  including  i completion of the consolidation plan in december with the closing of the facilities in san jose and the corresponding staff reductions  ii inclusion of sg a expenses due to the txport acquisition for months in fiscal compared to months in fiscal  and iii depreciation and amortization related to our oracle erp implementation for months in fiscal compared to months in fiscal the decrease in sg a spending in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales is due to the slight decrease in dollar spending at higher sales levels 
restructuring charges during fiscal  the company announced and completed the consolidation of its operations into its existing operations located in huntsville  alabama  and outsourced its san jose based manufacturing activities announced in july the company incurred a net restructuring charge during fiscal of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of this restructuring charge 
approximately  of the restructuring charge was cash in nature and paid out of the company s working capital 
in march  the company announced and implemented a restructuring of the business to streamline operations and eliminate redundant functions by consolidating manufacturing operations  combining sales and marketing functions  and restructuring research and development activities 
included as a part of the restructuring activities was the retirement of the company s two founders 
the company incurred a restructuring charge of  in fiscal and a credit of  was recorded in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of the restructuring charge 
approximately  of the restructuring charge was cash in nature and paid out of the company s working capital 
in process research and development charge related to acquisition effective november   the company completed its acquisition of txport  inc from acme cleveland corporation  by purchasing all the outstanding shares of txport at a cost of  the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method  and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including core technology  and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition 
the in process research and development of  which was expensed at the acquisition date  represented the estimated current fair market value of the research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses at the date of the acquisition 
interest and other income  net and interest expense interest and other income  net  declined to  in fiscal from  and  in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of lower average invested cash and short term investment balances  an increase in early payment discounts from customers  and lower interest rates 
with the completion of renovations to the new headquarters facility in january  the company began charging interest payments on long term debt to interest expense that totaled  during the last half of fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes during fiscal  the company established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the net operating loss carry forwards from prior years and the operating losses incurred in the current fiscal year 
the operating losses in the current fiscal year  while not expected at the beginning of the year  were driven by the development costs associated with the optical network access project announced in october  as well as the downturn in the overall telecommunication market that the company serves 
therefore  the provision for income taxes of  established a full valuation allowance at september  against the company s deferred tax assets 
in fiscal with a return to profitability during the last two quarters of that fiscal year and the expectation of profits in fiscal  the company reversed the deferred tax asset valuation allowance that had been established in fiscal and recorded a net benefit from income taxes of  the effective tax rate in fiscal without the impact of the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was a benefit of approximately  compared to a combined federal and state statutory rate of about 
the effective tax rate in fiscal without the impact of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is less than the combined federal and state rates primarily due to the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the txport acquisition 
in fiscal  the company recorded no benefit from income taxes due to operating losses and the uncertainty of realization of the company s net deferred tax assets that existed at that time 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s principal source of liquidity included  of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
during fiscal  the company generated  of net cash from operating activities  compared to net cash used in operating activities in fiscal and of  and  respectively  due to better working capital management in fiscal accounts receivable decreased  to  at june  from the prior year balance due to the timing of shipments during the fourth quarter of each year and the early payment discount plan utilized by our largest customer in fiscal accounts receivable increased  to  at june   over the balance at june  due to more shipments being made towards the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and a slow down in payments from our largest customer 
inventories decreased  to  at june  as a result of better control of inventory levels  and decreased  to  at june  due to raw materials and work in process inventories transferred to the third party electronics manufacturing services provider in october as part of the restructuring and consolidation plan 
in fiscal  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased in total by  due to the lower sales volume and cost reduction efforts implemented during the year 
during fiscal  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased in total by  to  due to lower salary and benefit accruals associated with reduced headcount from the consolidation of operations  payments charged against the warranty reserve for the agreement reached with a customer to share in the cost of field upgrades  and one time adjustments to estimated accruals to customers and vendors 
net cash used in investing activities of  in fiscal compares to net cash provided by investing activities of  in fiscal and net cash used in investing activities of  in fiscal the use of funds in fiscal were due to capital expenditures of  for renovations to the new headquarters facility  the completion of the oracle implementation project in july  and other equipment purchases  offset by the maturity of short term investments of  the increase in funds provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily a result of the maturity of  in short term investments reduced by  in purchases of property  plant  and equipment that included the purchase of the new headquarters facility for  the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the maturity of  in short term investments offset by  of cash used for the acquisition of txport   for capital expenditures  and  in cash advanced to a director 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal proceeds of  less payments of  from loan agreements to borrow up to  to finance the acquisition of the headquarters facility and improvements thereon and  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans were the primary sources of cash in fiscal from financing activities 
during fiscal  proceeds of  from long term debt used to finance the acquisition of the new headquarters facility was the largest source of cash from financing activities along with proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
the use of cash in fiscal was primarily attributable to the company s repurchase of  of its common stock offset by  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
as discussed in note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  as of march  the remaining quarterly payments of  on outstanding loans to a principal stockholder and director were rescheduled to march and additional common stock delivered as collateral for the loans 
under the terms of the loan agreement with the principal stockholder  the outstanding balance is due in march the company believes that its cash and investment balances  along with anticipated cash flows from operations based upon current operating plans and the discretionary spending controls implemented during fiscal will be adequate to finance current operations and capital expenditures for the next fiscal year 
the company s future capital needs will depend on the company s ability to meet its current operating forecast  the ability to successfully bring new products to market  market demand for the company s products  and the overall economic strength of our customers in the telecommunication sector 
in the event that results of operations do not substantially meet the company s current operating forecast  the company may evaluate further cost containment  reduce investments or delay r d  which could adversely affect the company s ability to bring new products to market 
the company from time to time investigates the possibility of generating financial resources through committed credit agreements  technology or manufacturing partnerships  joint ventures  equipment financing  and offerings of debt and equity securities 
to the extent that the company obtains additional financing  the terms of such financing may involve rights  preferences or privileges senior to the company s common stock and stockholders may experience dilution 
subsequent events and liquidity the company continues to operate in a difficult business environment as general economic conditions in the united states and abroad have deteriorated subsequent to year end 
the telecommunications sector continues to experience weakness as the industry has delayed deployment of services and infrastructure 
the company has taken actions designed to align its cost structure with current market conditions 
in october  the company announced cost reduction measures  including company wide staff reductions and the suspension of its optical network access research and development project 
the company intends to consolidate its assets related to the optical network access project at its headquarters facility and to re evaluate its optical position in the future 
management believes that its cost reduction plan coupled with its current liquid asset position will allow the company to maintain adequate liquidity through fiscal management believes that its plans are attainable  but should the company experience even worse market conditions  certain other costs and expenditures would be reduced to maintain adequate liquidity 
the company has also announced the engagement of the investment banking firm of morgan keegan co  inc to assist the company in evaluating potential strategic alternatives 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which has an effective date of june  for all business combinations initiated after this date

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which has an effective date starting with fiscal years beginning after december  this statement  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
goodwill will cease to be amortized upon the implementation of the statement and companies will test goodwill at least annually for impairment 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no  accounting for asset retirement obligations aro  which has an effective date for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement addresses the diversity in practice for recognizing asset retirement obligations and requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value

over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
factors affecting future results as described by the following factors  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods

customer concentration 
a small number of customers continue to account for a majority of the company s sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel networks accounted for of the company s net sales  and the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel and worldcom accounted for and of the company s net sales  respectively  and net sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  net sales to nortel and worldcom accounted for and of the company s net sales  respectively  and net sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s net sales 
other than nortel networks and worldcom  no customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal years   or there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
the current economic climate and conditions in the telecommunication equipment industry are expected to result in reduced sales to the company s largest customers in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal certain customers of the company have been or may be acquired by other existing customers 
the impact of such acquisitions on net sales to such customers is uncertain  but there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will not result in a reduction in net sales to those customers 
in addition  such acquisitions could have in the past and could in the future  result in further concentration of the company s customers 
the company has in the past experienced significant declines in net sales it believes were in part related to orders being delayed or cancelled as a result of pending acquisitions relating to its customers 
there can be no assurance that future merger and acquisition activity among the company s customers will not have a similar adverse affect on the company s net sales and results of operations 
the company s customers are typically not contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period 
product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period 
in some cases  major customers have abruptly terminated purchases of the company s products 
loss of  or a material reduction in orders by  one or more of the company s major customers would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see competition and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of its executive officers and key management  sales  and technical personnel 
the company is a party to agreements with its executive officers to help ensure the officer s continual service to the company in the event of a change in control 
each of the company s executive officers  and key management  sales and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key personnel  or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel would delay product development cycles or otherwise would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key suppliers and component availability 
the company has an agreement with a single outside contractor to outsource substantially all of the company s manufacturing operations located in san jose prior to november  including its procurement  assembly  and system integration operations 
the products manufactured by the outside contractor located in california generated a majority of the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that this contractor will continue to meet the company s future requirements for manufactured products 
the inability of the company s contractor to provide the company with adequate supplies of high quality products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company generally relies upon contract manufacturers to buy component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies used in its products 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
currently  the company and third party sub contractors depend upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble  and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company has historically obtained several components and licenses for certain embedded software from single or limited sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company and third party sub contractors requirements for any such components 
the company and third party sub contractors generally do not have any long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
any loss in a key supplier  increase in required lead times  increase in prices of component parts  interruption in the supply of any of these components  or the inability of the company or its third party sub contractor to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of any of the company s outside contractors could cause a delay in the company s ability to fulfill orders while the company identifies a replacement contractor 
because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties  including those relating to payment terms  cost of manufacturing  adequacy of manufacturing capacity  quality control  and timeliness of delivery  the company is unable to predict whether such relationships would be on terms that the company regards as satisfactory 
any significant disruption in the company s relationships with its manufacturing sources would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
purchase orders from the company s customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
as the company does not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
the company uses internal forecasts to determine its general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms  and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  the company may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices  or termination of contracts 
from time to time  the company has experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations may occur in the future  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors resulting in more variability and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
for example  sales to nortel networks and worldcom have varied between quarters by as much as million  and order volatility by these customers had a significant impact on the company in fiscal most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times 
the company s ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the company has experienced large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation  or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
the company s sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment deployment projects 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by the third party subcontractors the company is using to outsource its manufacturing operations as well as by other vendors of components used in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the company s products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services and products 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
the company believes that sales in prior periods have been adversely impacted by merger activities by some of its top customers 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration and dependence on key suppliers and component availability 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve its sales objectives  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the company s operating results and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 
the company s industry is characterized by declining prices of existing products  and therefore continual improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products are required to maintain gross margins 
in response to customer demands or competitive pressures  or to pursue new product or market opportunities  the company may take certain pricing or marketing actions  such as price reductions  volume discounts  or provision of services at below market rates 
these actions could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of factors  particularly delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company has had  and in some future quarter may have operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see potential volatility of stock price 
the company s products are covered by warranties and the company is subject to contractual commitments concerning its products 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that the product does not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
potential volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
company specific factors or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
dependence on recently introduced products and new product development 
the company s future results of operations are highly dependent on market acceptance of existing and future applications for both the company s as product line and the wansuite family of integrated access devices introduced during fiscal the as product line represented approximately of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal  and of net sales in fiscal sales of wansuite products that began during the last quarter of fiscal did not contribute significantly to net sales during fiscal as the company had anticipated 
market acceptance of both the company s current and future product lines is dependent on a number of factors  not all of which are in the company s control  including the continued growth in the use of bandwidth intensive applications  continued deployment of new telecommunications services  market acceptance of integrated access devices in general  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success of the company s sales efforts 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the market for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  continuing improvements in telecommunication service offerings  and changing demands of the company s customer base 
failure to introduce new products in a timely manner could cause companies to purchase products from competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to a variety of factors  the company may experience delays in developing its planned products 
new products may require additional development work  enhancement  and testing or further refinement before the company can make them commercially available 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products  product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as changes in customer requirements 
such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if the company s products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  then the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
competition 
the market for telecommunications network access equipment is characterized as highly competitive with rapid price erosions on aging technologies 
even if the number of competitors fades in the next year  consolidation into fewer  larger competitors will likely fuel increased competition 
this market is subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments  and new entrants 
the market for integrated access devices such as the access system product line and wansuite and for enterprise devices such as the prism and framestart product lines is subject to rapid change 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in this market are the development and rapid introduction of products based on new technologies  high product value in price versus performance comparisons  support for multiple types of communication services  increased network monitoring and control  product reliability  and quality of customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products and future products will be able to compete successfully with respect to these or other factors 
the company s principal competition for its current as and as products are newbridge networks corporation  tellabs  telco systems  adc telecommunications  inc  adtran  inc  and paradyne inc 
competition for its wansuite and framestart products are visual networks  cisco systems  adtran  inc  and paradyne inc 
lastly  competition for enterprise access and termination products are adtran  inc  quick eagle networks  kentrox recently acquired by platinum equity holdings  general data corporation gdc  and paradyne inc in addition  advanced termination products are emerging which represent both new market opportunities as well as a threat to the company s current products 
furthermore  basic line termination functions are increasingly being integrated by competitors  such as cisco and nortel networks  into other equipment such as routers and switches 
these include direct wan interfaces in certain products  which may erode the addressable market for separate network termination products 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to the company s products and planned products  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the market for basic network termination products is mature and that margins are eroding  but the market for feature enhanced network termination and high bandwidth network access products may continue to grow and expand  as more capability and intelligence moves outward from the central office to the enterprise 
the company expects emerging broadband standards and technologies like g 
shdsl  atm  and dwdm to start the next wave of spending in this market as carriers and enterprises update services to the network edge 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have long established relationships with nsps 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future

reorganization of sales force 
in fiscal  the company restructured its sales force at the beginning of the year from a sales force organized by geographical region to one focused on sales to particular markets and through particular distribution channels 
midway through the year  the company further refined the sales force reorganization in order to emphasize both a geographic focus and product focus  and to better position the sales force for available sales opportunities 
this reorganization appeared to be disruptive in the first half of fiscal and the company s efforts midway through the fiscal year to return to a more geographic focus may continue to be disruptive to the company s sales in the future 
as a result  the company expects that the reorganization may continue to have a short term negative impact on the company s sales and results of operations 
these changes during this fiscal year may take longer or be less successful than anticipated  which  in either event  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development  and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
the company may need to supplement its internal expertise and resources with specialized expertise or intellectual property from third parties to develop new products 
the development of new products for the wan access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as dsl  isdn  frame relay  atm  and ip 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products that meet industry standards for safety  emissions  and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delays due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products  and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing  or managing the transition to new or enhanced products  or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the company were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 
see dependence on recently introduced products and new product development 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
standards for new services such as frame relay  performance monitoring services  and dsl are still evolving  such as the new g 
shdsl standard 
as these standards evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and therefore are expected to affect demand for such services and the telecommunications products that support such services 
tariff rates  whether determined by network service providers or in response to regulatory directives  may affect the cost effectiveness of deploying communication services 
such policies also affect demand for telecommunications equipment  including the company s products 
risks associated with potential acquisitions and joint ventures 
an important element of the company s historical strategy has been to review acquisition prospects and joint venture opportunities that would compliment its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities  or offer growth opportunities 
transactions of this nature by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurring of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and or the price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
joint ventures entail risks such as potential conflicts of interest and disputes among the participants  difficulties in integrating technologies and personnel  and risks of entering new markets 
the company s management has limited prior experience in assimilating such transactions 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future or to successfully develop any products or technologies that might be contemplated by any future joint venture or similar arrangement  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company to date has had minimal direct sales to customers outside of north america 
the company has little experience in the european and far eastern markets  but intends to expand sales of its products outside of north america and to enter certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of north america is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any company sales are denominated in foreign currency  the company s sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark  and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the related patent is issued and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  could relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company may receive communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
limited protection of intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
the company has been issued certain us and canadian patents with respect to limited aspects of its single purpose network access technology 
the company has not obtained significant patent protection for its access system technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties have not or will not develop equivalent technologies or products without infringing the company s patents or that a court having jurisdiction over a dispute involving such patents would hold the company s patents valid  enforceable  and infringed 
the company also typically enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and independent contractors  and non disclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus  make the possibility of misappropriation of the company s technology and products more likely 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company is subject to interest rate risks on its long term debt 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the additional interest expense would not be material 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material
