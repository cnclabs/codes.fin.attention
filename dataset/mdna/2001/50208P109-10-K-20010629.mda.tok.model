see business overview 
these acquisitions give lml a suite of retail point of sale check handling services and an infrastructure to further expand its offerings to include other forms of electronic payment systems in the future such as expansion into the e commerce market 
the acquisitions that have been completed by lml over the past two years have made our results of operations not comparable year over year due to a full months of operation results not being included in current or prior fiscal years  as well as the increase in amortization for all the acquisitions 
the acquisition of cf data and check center  which were completed in fiscal year  were not included in our results of operations until december and january  respectively 
the acquisition of phoenix eps and check technologies  which were completed in fiscal year  were not included in our results of operations until july during the fiscal year ended march   lml established a primary processing center in phoenix  arizona

total revenues for fiscal year were approximately million  a increase over revenues of approximately million for the fiscal year revenues derived from the financial payment processing services increased from million in fiscal year to million for fiscal year this increase was principally attributable to the acquisition of phoenix eps and check technologies  which were completed in july  and the inclusion of a full year of operations for cf data and check center  which were acquired in november and january  respectively the acquisitions 
revenues related to wildwood estates increased from  in fiscal year to  for fiscal year costs of operations costs of operations increased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  an increase of 
financial payment processing costs of operations increased from million in fiscal year to million for fiscal year the increase was principally attributable to inclusion of a full year of operations for cf data and check center  acquired in fiscal year  and inclusion of costs for the acquisitions of phoenix eps and check technologies  which were completed in fiscal year costs of operations consist of transaction processing costs  personnel costs  equipment related costs and telecommunication costs 
for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of sales decreased to compared to for fiscal year this decrease was due to the operating activities from the acquisitions 
costs of operations related to wildwood estates increased from  in fiscal year to  for fiscal year sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences and public relations 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses are principally attributable to inclusion of a full year of expenses for cf data and check center  acquired in fiscal year  and inclusion of expenses for the acquisitions of phoenix eps and check technologies  which were completed in fiscal year the increase is also due to professional fees associated with various legal matters and expenses associated with the relocation of the jacksonville  florida office to dallas  texas 
for fiscal year  expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to compared to for fiscal year this decrease was due to the operating activities from the acquisitions 
other expenses and income other expenses increased to  in fiscal year from  for fiscal year interest income for fiscal year increased to  from  for fiscal year the increase in other expenses was primarily attributed to  in costs associated with the wildwood estates legal settlement  as well as  in costs associated with the merger of lml s subsidiaries which took place on april   and expenses for potential acquisitions that lml has determined will not be completed 
the increase in other income is due to the increase in interest earned for funds placed in term deposits or short term commercial paper 
amortization and depreciation amortization on intangibles increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year depreciation expenses relating to the chequemark system software and other software increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year depreciation expenses for capital assets increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year these increases are principally associated with amortization of goodwill from the acquisitions and amortization of the patents  depreciation of the chequemark system software and the software acquired in the acquisition of phoenix eps  and depreciation of capital assets acquired in the acquisitions 
ebitda earnings before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  decreased to a loss of approximately million in fiscal year from a loss of approximately million for fiscal year the decrease is primarily the result of amortization of intangibles  depreciation of capital assets and increased costs associated with the acquisitions  as well as costs associated with the wildwood estates legal settlement  and the costs associated with the merger of lml s subsidiaries  which took place on april  income taxes management regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets given the nature of its operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which lml operates 
the valuation allowance is adjusted from time to time based on such evaluations 
management considers it more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  the deferred tax asset is reserved in full as of march  net loss net loss increased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the increase in lml s net loss is due primarily to amortization of intangibles  depreciation of capital assets and increased costs associated with the acquisitions 
loss per both basic and diluted shares was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues for fiscal year were approximately million  a increase over revenues of approximately  for fiscal year revenues derived from the financial payment processing services increased from  in fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the revenue increase is principally attributable to the acquisitions of cf data and check center 
revenues related to wildwood estates decreased from  in fiscal year to  for fiscal year ebitda is earnings before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
lml believes that  in addition to cash flows from operations and net income  ebitda is a useful financial performance measure for assessing operating performance as it provides an additional basis to evaluate the ability of lml to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures 
to evaluate ebitda  the components of ebitda such as revenue and operating expenses and the variability of such components over time should also be considered 
ebitda should not be construed  however  as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of lml s operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
lml s method of calculating ebitda may differ from methods used by other companies  and as a result  ebitda measures disclosed herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
costs of operations costs of operations increased from approximately  in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  an increase of 
financial payment processing costs of operations increased from  in fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the increase in costs of operations are principally attributable to the acquisitions of cf data and check center

costs related to wildwood estates decreased from  in fiscal year to  for fiscal year sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences and public relations

the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses are principally attributable to the acquisitions completed in fiscal other expenses and income other expenses for fiscal year were  compared to other income for fiscal year of  consisting mainly of a gain in settlement of debts relating to payroll taxes 
interest income for fiscal year was  from interest earned for funds placed in term deposits or short term commercial paper 
no interest income was earned in fiscal amortization and depreciation amortization on intangibles increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year depreciation expenses relating to the chequemark system software increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year depreciation expenses for capital assets increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year these increases are principally associated with amortization of goodwill and depreciation of capital assets acquired in the acquisitions of cf data and check center  which were completed in fiscal year ebitda loss before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  for fiscal year was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal year income taxes management regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets given the nature of its operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which lml operates 
the valuation allowance is adjusted from time to time based on such evaluations 
management considers it more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  the deferred tax asset is reserved in full as of march  net loss net loss for both fiscal year and fiscal year was approximately million 
both basic and diluted loss per share were in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources lml s liquidity and financial position consisted of approximately million in working capital as of march  compared to approximately million in working capital as of march  the decrease in working capital was primarily related to a decrease in cash associated with legal costs associated with lml s patents  the phoenix and check technologies acquisitions  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to approximately million as of march  from approximately million at march   and a dividend payment of approximately  required under the conversion agreement as amended with destiny 
the decrease was offset by an increase in accounts receivable to  as of march  from  at march  see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder security matters dividend policy 
cash flows used in operations were approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal expenditures during fiscal consisted mainly of capital asset expenditures  additional consideration for certain patents and the acquisition of phoenix and check technologies 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the private placements of lml s common stock that were completed in november and march management believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  and potential cash flows from operations will satisfy lml s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
however  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies or other arrangements could require lml to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 

this interpretation is effective for applicable transactions beginning july  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on lml s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued a revision to a previously issued exposure draft covering business combinations proposing new accounting guidance related to goodwill 
this proposed standard would not allow for amortization of goodwill 
the carrying amount of goodwill would be reduced only if it was found to be impaired 
goodwill would be tested for impairment when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
a fair value based impairment test would be used to measure goodwill for impairment in lieu of the method for measuring impairment of long lived assets set forth in sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
as goodwill is measured as a residual amount in an acquisition  it is not possible to directly measure the fair value of goodwill 
under this proposed standard  the net assets of a reporting unit should be subtracted from the fair value of that reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value 
the provisions of this proposed standard may be adopted by lml in fiscal or management is currently assessing the period of adoption and believes adoption of this standard  as it is proposed  will have a material non cash impact on lml s financial statements as it will not allow for amortization of goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lml is exposed to market risk from changes in marketable securities which consist of money market and commercial paper 
at march   marketable securities of lml were recorded at a fair value of approximately million  with an overall weighted average return of approximately and an overall weighted average life of less than three months 
the marketable securities held by lml have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of basis points of lml s overall average return on marketable securities in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of the marketable securities 
lml is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of its long term debt is at a fixed rate as of march  the fair value of lml s debt approximates its carrying value 
to date  lml has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and is currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
lml has immaterial exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
to date  lml has not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk and is currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments
