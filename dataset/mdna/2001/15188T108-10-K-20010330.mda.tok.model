item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a delaware business trust principally engaged in the acquisition and ownership directly or indirectly of tax exempt multifamily housing revenue bonds revenue bonds and other investments that produce tax exempt income issued by various state or local governments  agencies  or authorities 
accordingly  the company produces tax exempt income which it directly passes through to its shareholders in the form of a quarterly tax exempt dividend 
revenue bonds are secured by mortgage loans on underlying properties underlying properties 
the company is governed by a board of trustees comprised of three independent managing trustees and four managing trustees who are affiliated with related capital company  a nationwide  fully integrated real estate financial services firm 
the company has engaged related charter lp the manager  an affiliate of related  to manage its day to day affairs and to provide  among other things  acquisition  financial  accounting  capital markets  asset monitoring  portfolio management  investor relations and public relations services 
the company does not operate as a mortgage reit  which generally utilize high levels of leverage and acquire subordinated interests in commercial and or residential mortgage backed securities 
unlike mortgage reits that typically incur leverage at ratios ranging from to  the company is only able to incur leverage or other financing up to of the company s total market value as defined and pursuant to its trust agreement as of the date incurred 
furthermore  the revenue bonds owned by the company generally call for ten year restrictions from prepayments  eliminating the company s susceptibility to significant levels of repayment risk as a result of interest rate reductions 
due to the company s low level of leverage  the company has not been affected by the lack of liquidity that recently impaired mortgage reits and its portfolio does not contain assets that are especially vulnerable to volatility during periods of interest rate fluctuations 
consistent with the foregoing  the company focuses on providing investors with a stable level of distributions  even through unstable markets 
in order to generate increased tax exempt income and  as a result  enhance the value of the company s shares  the company intends to invest in or acquire additional revenue bonds 
the company believes that it can earn above market rates of interest on its bond acquisitions by focusing its efforts primarily on affordable housing 
the traditional method of financing tax exempt properties requires the involvement of credit enhancement  rating agencies and investment bankers 
therefore  the up front cost of such financing is generally much higher than traditional multifamily financing 
the company has designed a direct purchase program specifically to appeal to developers of such properties through which the company will invest in or acquire tax exempt bonds without the cost associated with credit enhancement  rating agencies and investment bankers 
the company believes that the up front cost savings to the developer will translate into a higher than market interest rate on the bonds acquired by the company 
the company believes that it is well positioned to market its direct purchase program as a result of the manager s affiliation with related because the manager is able to utilize related s resources and relationships in the multifamily affordable housing finance industry to source potential borrowers of first mortgage bonds 
related and its predecessor companies have specialized in offering debt and equity products to mid market multifamily owners and developers for over years 
according to the national multihousing council survey  related is the third largest owner of apartments in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources in order for the company to fund its investments in revenue bonds and facilitate growth  the company has primarily used two sources of capital collateralized debt securitizations and equity offerings 
to date  the primary source of long term liquidity has come from the company s private label tender option program and preferred equity offerings by the company or a subsidiary 
during the years and  the company raised additional capital as follows amount of capital raised during ending balance capital source december  equity series a preferred   series a preferred   series b preferred   convertible cra preferred   securitizations private label tender option program    p floats rites    these capital raising transactions are described in more detail below 
the company has two primary securitization programs the private label tender option program and the p floats rites program 
securitizations continue to offer efficient execution and the lowest cost of capital  albeit with certain covenants and leverage limits 
pursuant to its trust agreement  the company is only able to incur leverage or other financing up to of the company s total market value  such terms are generally consistent or more conservative than leverage covenants on the company s securitized debt 
short term liquidity is provided by interest income from revenue bonds and promissory notes in excess of the related financing costs  and interest income from cash and temporary investments 
the company believes that its financing capacity and cash flow from current operations are adequate to meet its current and projected liquidity requirements 
management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way 
capital raising transactions i preferred equity issuances by subsidiary since june  the company  through a subsidiary  has issued multiple series of cumulative preferred shares 
proceeds from these offerings were used to invest in or acquire additional tax exempt assets for the company 
preferred date of mandatory mandatory number liquidation total face dividend series issuance tender repurchase of sharespreference per share amount rate series a   series a   series b   each series of cumulative preferred shares has an annual preferred dividend payable quarterly in arrears upon declaration thereof by the company s board of trustees  but only to the extent of tax exempt net income for the particular quarter 
all series of cumulative preferred shares are subject to mandatory tender by the holders thereof for remarketing and purchase on their respective mandatory tender dates and each remarketing date thereafter at their respective liquidation preference per share plus an amount equal to all distributions accrued but unpaid 
holders of cumulative preferred shares may elect to retain their shares upon remarketing  with a distribution rate to be determined immediately prior to the remarketing date by the remarketing agent 
each holder of cumulative preferred shares will be required to tender its shares to the issuer for mandatory repurchase on the mandatory repurchase date  unless the company decides to remarket the shares on such date 
cumulative preferred shares are not convertible into common shares of the company 
the series a and a cumulative preferred shares rank  with respect to payment of distributions and amounts upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company  senior to all classes or series of convertible cra shares  series b cumulative preferred shares and common shares of the of the company 
the series b subordinate cumulative preferred shares rank  with respect to payment of distributions and amounts upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company  senior to the company s common shares and the company s convertible cra shares and junior to the issuer s series a and a cumulative preferred shares 
since inception  all quarterly distributions have been declared at each stated annualized dividend rate for each respective series and all distributions due have been paid 
in february  preferred shareholder distributions that were declared in december  were paid to the preferred shareholders from cash flow from operations for the quarter ended december  the per share distributions declared and paid for this period were as follows dividend per share total distribution series a    series a    series b    ii convertible community reinvestment act preferred share offerings on may   the company completed a  private placement of convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares convertible cra shares to three financial institutions  convertible cra shares priced at per share 
on december   the company completed an additional  private placement of convertible cra shares to three additional financial institutions  convertible cra shares priced at per share 
the convertible cra shares enable financial institutions to receive certain regulatory benefits in connection with their investment 
the company has developed a proprietary method for specially allocating these regulatory benefits to specific financial institutions that invest in the convertible cra shares 
other than the preferred allocation of regulatory benefits  the preferred investors receive the same economic benefits as common shareholders of the company  including receipt of the same dividends per share as those paid to common shareholders 
the company s earnings are allocated pro rata among the common shares and the convertible cra shares  and the convertible cra shares rank on parity with the common shares with respect to rights upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company 
the investors  at their option  have the ability to convert their convertible cra shares into common shares at a predetermined conversion price 
upon conversion  the investors will no longer be entitled to a special allocation of the regulatory benefit 
the conversion price is the greater of i the company s book value per common share as set forth in the company s most recently issued annual or quarterly report filed with the sec prior to the respective convertible cra share issuance date or ii of the closing price of a common share on the respective convertible cra share s pricing date 
the conversion price for each convertible cra share offering is indicated on the following table issuance date conversion price conversion ratio may  december  iii private label tender option program on may   the company closed on its private label tender option program top in order to raise additional capital to acquire additional revenue bonds 
as of december   the maximum amount of capital that could be raised under the top was  on december   the company refined the structure the top for the primary purpose of segregating revenue bonds issued by governmental entities in california from the remainder of the revenue bonds under the top and to increase the maximum amount of capital available under the program to  in addition  the top s surety commitment was extended for a five year term 
the liquidity commitment is a one year renewable commitment 
the company expects to renew or replace such commitments upon expiration of their terms 
under the top structure  the company contributes revenue bonds to charter mac origination trust i the origination trust  a wholly owned  indirect subsidiary of the company 
the origination trust then contributes certain of these revenue bonds to charter mac owner trust i the owner trust which is controlled by the company 
the owner trust contributes selected bonds to specific series trusts in order to segregate revenue bonds issued by governmental entities selected by state of origin 
as of december   two such series trusts were created a california only series and a national non state specific series 
each series trust  issues two equity certificates i a senior certificate which has been deposited into a certificate trust which issues and sells floater certificates representing proportional interests in the senior certificate to new investors and ii a residual certificate  issued to the origination trust which represents the remaining beneficial ownership interest in each series trust 
the effect of the top structure is that a portion of the interest received on revenue bonds in the owner trust is distributed through the senior certificate to the holders of the floater certificates with any remaining interest remitted to the origination trust and thus to the benefit of the company via the residual certificate 
the effect of the december   refinement of the top structure was to segregate the california related floater certificates as they generally will pay distributions at lower rates than national non state specific floater certificates and thus the yield on the residual certificates owned by the origination trust is increased 
the revenue bonds remaining in the origination trust aggregate principal amount of approximately  are an additional collateral pool for the owner trust s obligations under the senior certificate 
the balance of the top at december  the equity in the owner trust  represented by the senior certificate  was  the company s floating rate cost of funds relating to the top calculated as income allocated to the minority interest plus recurring fees as a percentage of the weighted average amount of the outstanding senior certificate was approximately  and for the years ended december   and the period may  inception through december   respectively 
iv p floats rites another source for financing the company s investments is the securitization of selected revenue bonds through the merrill lynch pierce fenner smith incorporated merrill lynch p floats rites program 
merrill lynch deposits each revenue bond into an individual special purpose trust together with a credit enhancement guarantee 
two types of securities are then issued by each trust  puttable floating option tax exempt receipts p floats  a short term senior security which bears interest at a floating rate that is reset weekly and residual interest tax exempt securities rites  a subordinate security which receives the residual interest payment after payment of p float interest and ongoing transaction fees 
the p floats are sold to qualified third party  tax exempt investors and the rites are generally sold back to the company 
during the year  the company transferred three revenue bonds with an aggregate face amount of  to p floats rites program and received proceeds of  the company s cost of funds relating to its secured borrowings under the merrill lynch p floats rites program calculated as interest expense as a percentage of the weighted average amount of the secured borrowings was approximately and  annualized  for the year ended december  and the period june  inception of this program through december   respectively

inflation inflation did not have a material effect on the company s results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the nature of the company s investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose the company to income and expense volatility due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the revenue bonds generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying properties  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the top program and on the secured borrowings under the p float program vary based on market interest rates based on the bond market association bma index and are re set weekly 
other long term sources of capital  such as the company s various series of cumulative preferred shares  carry a fixed dividend rate and so are not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
prior to december   management did not engage in any of these hedging strategies 
however  beginning in  and upon management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies  the company has entered into interest rate swaps in order to hedge against increases in the floating interest rate on its top and p floats programs 
on january   the company entered into a five year interest swap that fixes the bma index to on a notional amount of million 
on february   the company entered into a three year interest swap that fixes the bma index to on a notional amount of an additional million 
subsequent to december   with respect to the portion of the company s floating rate financing programs which are not hedged  a change in the bma rate would result in increased or decreased payments under these financing programs  without a corresponding change in cash flows from the investments in revenue bonds 
for example  based on the unhedged million million outstanding under these financing programs at december   less the million notional amount subsequently hedged and assuming a perfect hedge correlation the company estimates that an increase of in the bma rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately  conversely  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company in the same amount described above  as a result of decreased allocations to the minority interest and interest expense without corresponding decreases in interest received on revenue bonds 
changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio of revenue bonds 
the company estimates the fair value for each revenue bond as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of the company s revenue bonds will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in their estimated fair values 
for example  the company projects that a increase in market rates for tax exempt investments would decrease the estimated fair value of its portfolio of revenue bonds from its december  value of  to approximately  a decline in interest rates would increase the value of the december  portfolio to approximately  changes in the estimated fair value of the revenue bonds do not impact the company s reported net income  earnings per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity 
the assumptions related to the foregoing discussion of market risk involve judgments involving future economic market conditions  future corporate decisions and other interrelating factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company and all of which are difficult or impossible to predict with accuracy 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking information are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information included herein will prove to be accurate
