item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources of esg re limited and its subsidiaries the company or esg re 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations the company previously operated two business segments  reinsurance and health care 
the reinsurance division is a specialty reinsurance enterprise providing accident  medical  credit  life and other special risk reinsurance to insurers and selected reinsurers on a worldwide basis  and underwriting management services to co reinsurers 
effective june   the company discontinued the operations of its health care division 
reference is made to note of notes to financial statements for a description of the sale transaction and summary operating results 
the company reported a net loss of million for the year  compared to a net loss of million for included in the results were net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively  from discontinued operations 
the net loss from continuing operations was million for and million for the results for continuing operations have been disappointing 
the nature of esg re s business has meant that the company had continued exposure to underwriting decisions made in previous years 
initially  as the company had relatively limited specific historical experience on a significant number of its programs on which to base its estimate of losses incurred but not reported  its reliance on ceding company expectations and industry experience was necessarily increased  which increased the uncertainty involved in the loss estimation process 
in the second half of the year  the company reviewed all major contracts with internal and external resources for adequacy of reserving and the related profitability 
this resulted in a further strengthening of loss reserves 
in response to the results  the company centralized underwriting in dublin 
in addition  the company writes at a conservative ratio of net written premium to capital 
effective june   the company divested its health care division 
net losses of million in and million in  representing primarily the costs incurred to establish the division and to position the related health care products  are being reported as discontinued operations 
as part of the divestment  the company retained  convertible preference shares  par value per share  in this operation 
the book value of million for the company s equity position is included in other investments 
the operations of the former health care division have entered into a strategic partnership with bertelsmann springer for the marketing of its services to german health insurers 
to date  sales proposals have been made to three of the largest insurers with decisions due back in april and may the expectation is that the group will be successful on at least one of the proposals 
in the event none of the proposals are accepted  then the group would be in a position to revisit its business model and esg re would revalue its investment 
since the third quarter of  the company has made significant progress in executing its business plan centered on select reinsurance writings and partnership enterprises 
reserves established appear to be adequate in the company s efforts to ring fence the issues associated with the and underwriting years 
while there can be no assurance that the reserves at any given date are adequate to meet the company s obligations  the amounts reported in the company s balance sheet are management s best estimate of that amount

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is subject to market risk arising from the potential change in value of its various financial instruments 
these changes may be due to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency rates  or both in the case of foreign currency investments 
the company monitors its exposure to interest rate and currency rate risk on a quarterly basis and currently does not believe that the use of derivatives to manage such risk is necessary 
the company intends to reevaluate the need for a formal hedging strategy on a periodic basis  and may determine that such a strategy  including the use of derivative instruments  is appropriate in the future 
interest rate risk the largest source of market risk for the company is interest rate risk on its portfolio of fixed maturity investments  especially fixed rate instruments 
in addition  the credit worthiness of the issuer  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity and general market conditions may affect fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the company s general strategy with respect to fixed maturity securities is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant concentrations in individual issuers industry segments or countries 
generally  it is expected that an increase in market interest rates will cause a decline in the value of the company s investment portfolio  whereas a decrease in rates may cause an increase in value 
the following table shows the approximate effect on the value of the company s fixed maturities investment portfolio  based on hypothetical changes in market interest rates for the year ended december  and basis basis basis market basis basis basis points points points value points points points us dollars in thousands december         december         the changes in portfolio values shown were ascertained by calculating the market yield of each bond given its actual market price at december  and  raising or lowering each bond s yield by the hypothetical changes in market interest rates indicated above and  then calculating the resulting prices and the resulting aggregate market values 
the modeled yield changes are assumed to occur instantaneously and equally across the yield curve 
price changes of floating rate bonds were calculated assuming coupons adjusted by the modeled amounts at their next scheduled reset date 
effects on portfolio value of prepayment related interest rate changes in the case of mortgage backed securities are de minimis 
the values indicated above are estimates and are necessarily based on various assumptions that are subjective in nature 
accordingly  the actual impact of changes in market rates on the company s investment portfolio may be significantly greater or less than those indicated above 
foreign currency risk the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
however  the company writes reinsurance business in numerous geographic regions and currencies  giving rise to the risk that the ultimate settlement of receivables and payables on reinsurance transactions will differ from the amounts currently recorded as assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the company intends to hold investments in currencies in which it will collect premiums and pay claims  thus creating a partial natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations 
the company believes that its exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations for any of the three years presented 
the company writes reinsurance in latin america which has experienced periods of high inflation 
however  it is possible that future inflationary conditions may impact subsequent accounting periods 
the euro on january   a single currency  the euro  was adopted as the national currency of the participating countries in the european monetary union  including germany and ireland  two of the countries in which the company operates and in which the company maintains a significant presence 
esg s german and irish subsidiaries will not be required to use the euro for accounting purposes prior to january  due to uncertainties related to the euro conversion  the impact of the conversion is not known 
to date  the impact of the conversion has had no material impact on the company s operations  accounting systems or financial reporting
