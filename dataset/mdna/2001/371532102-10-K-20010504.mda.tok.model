cash flow from operations is generated principally in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million decrease in cash flow from operating activities reflects primarily a million increase in accounts receivable due to increased wholesale sales and extended terms  increased inventory and a million increase in taxes paid 
the million increase in inventories at february  from january  levels reflects increases in retail inventory to support the net increase of stores  excluding nautica leased departments  in fiscal as well as increases to support the company s continued growth 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million increase in cash flow from operating activities reflected primarily improved earnings  a much smaller increase in inventory for fiscal compared to fiscal and an increase in accrued liabilities for increased bonus accruals and income taxes to be paid in fiscal the million increase in inventories at january  from january  levels reflects planned increases in retail inventory to support the net increase of stores  excluding jarman leased and nautica leased departments  in fiscal accounts receivable at january  decreased million compared to january   primarily due to exiting the jarman leased departments business  also contributing to the cash flow improvement 
the company s earnings before income taxes  discontinued operations and extraordinary loss for fiscal improved by million over the prior year 
federal income taxes paid for fiscal increased by only million from the prior year  as the company utilized its remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
cash provided or used due to changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are as follows fiscal year ended in thousands accounts payable  accrued liabilities    the fluctuations in accounts payable for fiscal from fiscal and for fiscal from fiscal are due to changes in payment terms negotiated with individual vendors  inventory levels and buying patterns 
the change in accrued liabilities in fiscal as well as fiscal was due primarily to increased bonus accruals and income tax accruals 
there were no revolving credit borrowings during fiscal  or  as cash generated from operations and cash on hand funded seasonal working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal capital expenditures as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in retail store capital expenditures due to the increase in new stores 
the million decrease in fiscal capital expenditures as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease of capital expenditures connected with new system initiatives related to the year  which more than offset the increase in retail store capital expenditures due to the increase in new stores 
total capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
these include expected retail expenditures of million to open approximately journeys stores  journeys kidz stores  johnston murphy stores and factory stores  and underground station stores  and to complete major store renovations 
capital expenditures for wholesale and manufacturing operations and other purposes  including a new distribution center  are expected to be approximately million  including approximately million for new computer systems to improve customer service and support the company s growth and approximately million for a new distribution center 
due to the company s retail growth  the company has begun studies for a new distribution center 
the company does not know the size or location of the facility  but expects it to be located in the middle tennessee area 
the company expects the fiscal cost of the facility to be in the range of million to million 
the company s current bank agreement has been amended in order to facilitate the additional capital expenditure for the new distribution center 
environmental and other contingencies the company is subject to certain loss contingencies related to environmental proceedings and other legal matters  including those disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has made provisions for certain of these contingencies  including approximately million reflected in fiscal and  reflected in fiscal the company monitors these matters on an ongoing basis and at least quarterly management reviews the company s reserves and accruals in relation to each of them  adjusting provisions as management deems necessary in view of changes in available information 
changes in estimates of liability are reported in the periods when they occur 
consequently  management believes that its reserve in relation to each proceeding is a reasonable estimate of the probable loss connected to the proceeding  or in cases in which no reasonable estimate is possible  the minimum amount in the range of estimated losses  based upon its analysis of the facts and circumstances as of the close of the most recent fiscal quarter 
because of uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation generally and in environmental proceedings in particular  however  there can be no assurance that future developments will not require additional reserves to be set aside  that some or all reserves may not be adequate or that the amounts of any such additional reserves or any such inadequacy will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
future capital needs the company expects that cash on hand and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund all of its capital expenditures through fiscal the approximately million of costs associated with the prior restructurings and discontinued operations that are expected to be incurred during the next twelve months are also expected to be funded from cash on hand 
in february of  the company authorized the additional repurchase  from time to time  of up to million shares of the company s common stock 
these purchases will be funded from available cash 
the company has repurchased a total of million shares at a cost of million out of authorizations totaling million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit agreement at february   leaving availability under the revolving credit agreement of million

the aggregate of annual dividend requirements on the company s subordinated serial preferred stock  series  series and series  and on its subordinated cumulative preferred stock is  financial market risk the following discusses the company s exposure to financial market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
outstanding debt of the company the company s outstanding long term debt of million convertible subordinated notes due april bears interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
the fair value of the company s long term debt was million at february  based on a dealer quote 
cash and short term investments the company s cash and short term investment balances are invested in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at february  as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at february   if any  is low 
foreign currency exchange rate risk most purchases by the company from foreign sources are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that import transactions are denominated in other currencies  it is the company s practice to hedge its risks through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
gains and losses from these transactions are included in the cost of the underlying purchases 
the gain on contracts outstanding at february  was million from current spot rates 
at february   the company had million of foreign exchange contracts for italian lira and euro 
as of february   a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately million 
summary based on the company s overall market interest rate and foreign currency rate exposure at february   the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal would not be material 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

in july to delay the effective date of sfas no 
for one year  to fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value 
under certain conditions  a derivative may be specifically designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative are recorded each period in current earnings or in other comprehensive income depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
management of the company anticipates that  due to the company s limited use of derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in july  the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
the new pronouncement requires shipping and handling billings to customers be recorded as revenue
