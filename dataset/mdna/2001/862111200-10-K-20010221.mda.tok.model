general the company reported a net loss for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion  compared to a net loss for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion and net income for the year ended december   of million on revenue of billion 
the company s reported results for include one time pre tax restructuring expenses of million and other related restructuring expenses of million 
excluding these one time expenses  net of tax  the company would have reported net income of million during excluding one time litigation  restructuring and other related expenses  net of tax  the company would have reported net income of million during total revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to decreased revenue from storage products 
revenue from storage products decreased in  compared to  and revenue from storage services decreased in  compared to total gross profit margins remained largely unchanged at in  compared to revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to an increase in revenue from storage services 
gross profit margins decreased to in  compared to in  due to decreased margins from both storage products and storage services 
many of the company s customers undertake detailed procedures relating to the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of the company s products 
this evaluation process results in a variable sales cycle and makes it difficult to predict if or when revenue will be earned 
further  gross margins may be adversely impacted in an effort to complete the sales cycle 
the company s financial results may be adversely impacted by its variable sales cycle 
future financial results are also dependent upon the company s ability to manage its costs and operating expenses in line with revenue  the timely development  manufacture and introduction of new products and services  and the implementation of its storage area network san strategy 
for the discussion of these and other risk factors  see factors that may affect future results  below 
in april  the company first announced plans to restructure its business 
in october  the company announced additional restructuring plans 
these restructuring activities were intended to return the company to profitability 
as of september   the company had substantially completed all currently planned restructuring activities 
the company estimates annual savings of approximately million will be realized in connection with these restructurings 
because the restructuring activities were implemented in stages throughout the first nine months of  the company estimates the realized savings for the year were slightly in excess of million 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring activities described above will be sufficient to allow the company to realize the expected annualized savings or that additional restructuring activities may not be required in future periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the restructuring activities 
the company s cash balance increased million in as a result of progress in the company s efforts to more effectively manage working capital and the receipt of tax refunds of million in the company s operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash of million and million generated from operations in and  respectively  excluding the effects of one time payments related to litigation and restructuring 
the increase in cash generated from operations in and  was primarily the result of progress in the company s efforts to more effectively manage working capital 
see liquidity and capital resources working capital for additional discussion of operating cash flows 
cash used in investing activities decreased to million during  as compared to million in  primarily due to decreased expenditures on property  plant and equipment 
cash used in investing activities in was million as capital expenditures were offset by decreases in short term investments 
cash used in financing activities increased to million in  primarily due to repayments of borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
the following table  stated as a percentage of total revenue  presents consolidated statement of operations information and revenue by segment 
year ended december storage products tape products disk products network and other products total storage products storage services total revenue cost of revenue gross profit research and product development costs selling  general  administrative and other income and expense  net litigation expense restructuring expense operating profit loss interest income expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss revenue storage products the company s storage products revenue includes sales of tape  disk and network and other products 
revenue generated from storage products decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in oem sales of disk and software products to international business machines corporation ibm 
revenue generated from storage products increased in  compared to  as an increase in revenue from tape products was partially offset by a decline in disk revenue 
tape products tape product revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to decreased revenue from timberline r  a track cartridge subsystem  decreased revenue from powderhorn r  an automated cartridge system library  decreased sales of the timberwolf tm family of automated tape products designed for the client server market  and decreased revenue from other earlier generation mainframe tape products 
the decrease in revenue from these products reflects both lower selling prices and decreases in the number of units sold 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of the l series client server market tape libraries  the tape drive and virtual storage manager r vsm 
tape product revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased sales of the tape drive  increased sales of timberwolf tm tape products  and sales of tape media 
revenue from timberline r  powderhorn r and other earlier generation mainframe tape products declined during  compared to  reflecting both lower selling prices and decreases in the number of units sold 
the company believes that the sales of tape products designed for the mainframe market in were adversely impacted due to customers delaying testing and purchasing decisions in anticipation of the year disk products disk product revenue decreased in and in  due primarily to a decrease in oem sales to ibm of disk storage products and software 
the company does not anticipate any significant sales revenue from ibm in the future 
sales of openstorage tm disk products also decreased in and these decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct sales of the shared virtual array tm sva 
in october  the company announced the next generation of sva  however  there can be no assurance that the company s current and future disk products will gain additional market acceptance or that decreases in disk product revenue will not continue in the future 
network and other products network and other products revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to decreased revenue from earlier generation connectivity products offset by an increase in sales of third party hardware and software designed to provide storage networking solutions 
in october  the company introduced the storagenet tm series of domain managers 
network and other products revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from sales of third party hardware and software 
future revenue growth in the company s storage products segment is significantly dependent upon the continued demand for its tape automation products development of a successful disk sales strategy  and market acceptance of the storagenet tm and other network products designed for the emerging sans market 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these endeavors 
see factors that may affect future results new products and services and emerging markets  for a discussion of the risks associated with new products  new markets and distribution channels 
storage services storage services include revenue associated with the maintenance of the company s and third party storage products  as well as integration service revenue associated with storage consulting activities 
storage services revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to the company s exit from managed storage services and certain lower margin consulting and integration service activities in connection with the restructuring 
storage services revenue increased in  compared to  as the company expanded its consulting and integration service offerings 
there can be no assurance that service revenue will not continue to decline in the future as the customer base continues to shift to the client server marketplace 
maintenance revenue may also be adversely affected in future periods to the extent older products currently under maintenance contracts are replaced by newer products with extended warranties 
gross profit the following table sets forth the gross profit percentages for each segment calculated as gross profit for the segment divided by revenue for the segment 
year ended december total gross profit storage products storage services while total gross margins were largely unchanged for the full year  as compared to  margins from both products and services improved in the second half of as the company began to realize some of the benefits from its restructuring activities 
gross profit margins for the company s storage products decreased slightly during the decrease reflects decreases in the selling prices for disk products and earlier generation tape products  increases in sales of tape cartridges for use with the tape drive which have lower margins  increased sales of third party network products which have lower margins  a decline in sales of disk products to ibm  and unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with excess manufacturing capacity during the first half of these decreases were largely offset by increased sales of the recently introduced l series tape libraries  which generally carry higher margins than the earlier generation timberwolf tm automated tape products 
gross profit margins for the storage services segment increased to in compared to in  primarily as a result of reduced headcount  the elimination of unprofitable integration service activities and improvement in consulting margins 
gross profit margins decreased to in  compared to in the gross profit margins decreased in all of the company s business segments during gross margins for the company s products were adversely affected by efforts to shorten sales cycles  increased sales of tape cartridges and third party products which have lower profit margins  a decline in the selling prices for disk products and earlier generation tape products  and unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with excess manufacturing capacity 
gross margins associated with the services segment decreased principally as a result of increased revenue contribution from lower margin consulting  integration  and managed storage service offerings 
storage service margins were also adversely impacted by increased pricing pressures associated with the maintenance of storage products in the client server market and increased maintenance costs associated with certain tape products 
the markets for the company s products and services are subject to intense price competition 
the company anticipates that price competition for its products and services will continue to have an impact on the company s gross profit margins 
the company s ability to sustain or improve gross margins is dependent upon gaining operational efficiencies in connection with the restructuring activities  achieving cost improvements associated with the sourcing of production materials  the implementation of internal pricing controls and asset management disciplines and driving improved profitability from the company s continuing consulting and integration services activities 
storage product gross margins may be affected in future periods by inventory reserves and writedowns resulting from rapid technological changes or delays in gaining market acceptance for products 
research and product development research and product development expenses decreased in  compared to  as the company eliminated several lower priority research and product development programs in connection with the restructuring 
as part of the restructuring  the company is focusing research and development activities on the core businesses of tape automation  virtual storage  and san products and related services 
research and product development costs as a percentage of revenue increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to lower revenue and lower third party funding for research and development 
research and product development expenses increased in  compared to the company received approximately million less research and product development funding from third parties in  compared to excluding the effects of the reduced third party funding  research and product development expense decreased as a percentage of revenue in as compared to  due to the elimination of several lower priority research and product development programs in connection with the restructuring activities 
selling  general  administrative and other selling  general  administrative and other income and expense sg a decreased in  compared to  primarily as a result of headcount reductions and decreased selling expenses 
selling expenses decreased in as a result of reduced spending on product marketing activities  as well as reduced bonus and commission expenses associated with decreases in sales revenue 
general and administrative expenses decreased in primarily due to reduced headcount 
sg a increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased selling expenses 
the increase in selling expense reflects an increase in commission and bonus rates  increases in sales headcount  and an increase in marketing expenditures 
litigation in january  stuff technology partners ii  a colorado limited partnership stuff  filed suit in boulder county  colorado  district court the district court against the company and certain subsidiaries 
the suit alleged that the company breached a settlement agreement that had resolved earlier litigation between the parties concerning an optical disk drive storage development project entered into in which was unsuccessful and terminated in the suit sought injunctive relief and damages in the amount of billion 
on december   the district court granted the company s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint 
stuff appealed the dismissal to the colorado court of appeals the court of appeals 
in march  the court of appeals reversed the district court s judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings 
on july   the district court again dismissed  with prejudice  all of stuff s material claims against the company 
on august   stuff filed a notice of appeal with the appeals court seeking to overturn the decision of the district court 
oral arguments before the appeals court occurred on august  on august   the court of appeals remanded the case back to the district court for a trial on the factual issues relating to the interpretation of the language embodied in the settlement agreement 
the company filed a petition for rehearing with the court of appeals 
on october   the court of appeals modified its decision  but denied the company s petition for rehearing 
in november  the company filed a petition for certiorari with the supreme court of colorado 
the company continues to believe that stuff s claims are wholly without merit and intends to defend vigorously any further actions arising from this complaint 
in june  odetics  inc filed a patent infringement suit against the company alleging infringement of various patents 
during  the company recognized a pre tax expense of million in connection with the resolution of this litigation 
the company also recognized pre tax expenses of million in associated with the settlement of other litigation 
the company is also involved in various other less significant legal actions 
while the company currently believes that the amount of any ultimate potential loss would not be material to the company s financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in the company s inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
restructuring on october   the company announced a broad restructuring program intended to return the company to profitability 
key elements of the restructuring plan included an anticipated reduction of approximately  to  positions  with approximately positions eliminated during fiscal year and the remaining positions eliminated by the end of the third quarter of  a reduction in investment in certain businesses  including consulting and integration services and managed storage services  a recommitment to the company s core strengths of tape automation  virtual storage and storage area networks including related maintenance and professional services  modifications to the sales model for the united states and canada intended to improve productivity and increase account coverage and growth  other organizational and operational changes intended to improve efficiency and competitiveness 
the elements of the restructuring included an involuntary reduction in headcount  the elimination of a significant number of temporary employee positions  and managing the replacement of terminating employees due to normal attrition 
the headcount reductions were targeted in all areas of the company 
the company had substantially completed all currently planned restructuring activities as of september  the following table summarizes the reserves in connection with restructuring activities in thousands of dollars employee asset other exit severance writedowns costs total balances  december    restructuring expense    cash payments   asset writedowns   balances  december  employee severance expense of million was recognized during in connection with the restructuring 
this expense is comprised of separation charges related to the fixed and determinable severance payments owed to approximately  employees who were involuntarily terminated during in connection with the restructuring 
asset writedowns of million were recognized during in connection with the restructuring 
the asset writedowns are comprised of million related to the spin off of the company s managed storage services business and million related to an impairment writedown of assets at the company s manufacturing facility in toulouse  france 
at the time of the impairment  the company was engaged in activities to sell the toulouse facility and the impairment charge was required to reflect the company s estimate of fair value of the facility upon its anticipated sale 
the company has subsequently terminated negotiations to sell the facility and the company currently intends to retain the facility for the foreseeable future 
other exit costs of  were recognized during other exit costs are comprised of  associated with legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with the spin off of the managed storage services business and  related to excess lease space in canada 
the company incurred pre tax expenses of million during the year ended december   in connection with a restructuring announced in april this restructuring provided for a reduction in headcount as well as the elimination of certain lower priority research and development programs 
the company has now reached its goal of reducing  to  positions 
a net reduction of approximately  positions was achieved through a combination of involuntary severances  limiting the replacement of terminating employees due to normal attrition  and eliminating certain contractors  temporary employees and other non permanent positions 
the company estimates annual savings of approximately million will be realized in connection with the restructuring activities 
because the restructuring activities were implemented in stages throughout  the company estimates the realized savings for the year were slightly in excess of million 
the company does not anticipate any material incremental operating expenses will be incurred on an on going basis 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring activities described above will be successful or sufficient to allow the company to generate improved operating results in future periods 
it is possible that additional changes in the company s business or in its industry may necessitate additional restructuring expense in the future 
the necessity for additional restructuring activities may result in expenses that adversely affect reported results of operations in the period the restructuring plan is adopted  and require incremental cash payments 
interest income and expense interest expense decreased million in  compared to  due to decreased borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
interest income increased million in  compared to  as a result of an increase in cash available for investment 
see liquidity and capital resources available financing lines  for further discussion of the company s credit facilities 
interest expense increased million in  compared to  due to increased borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
interest income decreased million in  compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in cash available for investment 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and during fiscal  and  respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred income tax assets be recognized to the extent realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the currently available information  management has determined that the company will more likely than not realize million of deferred income tax assets as of december  the company s valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   relates principally to net deductible temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources working capital the company s cash balance increased million in as a result of progress in the company s efforts to more effectively manage working capital and the receipt of tax refunds of million in the company s operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash of million in  excluding the effects of one time payments related to litigation and restructuring 
the increase in cash generated from operations in and  was primarily the result of progress in the company s efforts to more effectively manage working capital 
cash used in investing activities decreased to million during  as compared to million in  primarily due to decreased expenditures on property  plant and equipment 
cash used in investing activities in was million as capital expenditures were offset by decreases in short term investments 
cash used in financing activities was million in primarily related to repayments of borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
the company s cash balance decreased million in due primarily to litigation payments of million and restructuring payments of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of litigation and restructuring  respectively 
excluding the effects of these one time payments  the company s operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash of million generated from operations in the increase in cash generated from operations in  compared to  was primarily the result of progress in the company s efforts to more effectively manage working capital 
cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to property  plant and equipment purchases of million 
cash used in financing activities of million in was mainly the result of cash payments of million associated with repurchases of common stock  largely offset by cash receipts of million from employee stock plans 
available financing lines borrowings under credit facilities consist of the following in thousands of dollars december  december  revolver  promissory notes denominated in foreign currencies   the company has a revolving credit facility the revolver which expires in october the credit limit available under the revolver million as of december  is reduced by million on the last business day of each calendar quarter 
the interest rates under the revolver depend upon the repayment period of the advance selected and the company s total debt to rolling four quarter earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio 
depending on the term of the outstanding borrowing  the rate ranges from the applicable libor plus to or the agent bank s base rate plus to 
the company had no outstanding borrowings as of december   but had outstanding letters of credit for approximately million under the revolver 
the remaining available credit under the revolver as of december   was approximately million 
the revolver is secured by the company s us accounts receivable and us inventory 
the revolver contains certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on payment of cash dividends on the company s common stock 
the company also had a million revolving credit facility the supplemental revolver  which the company decided not to renew and expired in january the company had no borrowings outstanding under the supplemental revolver as of december  the company has a financing agreement with a bank that provides for the sale of promissory notes in the principal amount of up to million at any one time 
the agreement  which expires in january  provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as of december   the company had promissory notes of million outstanding under this financing agreement and had committed to borrowings between january and january in the cumulative principal amount of approximately million 
the notes must be repaid only to the extent of future revenue 
obligations under the agreement are not cancelable by the company or the bank 
gains and losses associated with changes in the underlying foreign currencies are deferred during the commitment period and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment at the time the bank purchases the promissory notes 
the promissory notes  together with accrued interest  are payable in us dollars within days from the date of issuance 
the weighted average interest rate associated with the promissory notes outstanding as of december   was 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants and  under certain circumstances  may be required to maintain a collateral account  including cash and qualifying investments  in an amount up to the outstanding balance of the promissory notes 
the company believes it has adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
over the longer term  the company may choose to fund these activities through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that any additional long term financing  if required  can be completed on terms acceptable to the company 
total debt to total capitalization the company s total debt to capitalization ratio decreased from as of december   to as of december   primarily due to a net decrease in borrowings of million under the company s credit facilities 
see working capital  above  for discussion of cash sources and uses 
international operations during   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenue was generated by its international operations 
the company also sells products through its domestic indirect channel  which has end user customers located outside the united states 
the company expects that it will continue to generate a significant portion of its revenue from international operations in the future 
the majority of the company s international operations involve transactions denominated in the local currencies of countries within western europe  principally germany  france and the united kingdom  japan  canada and australia 
an increase in the exchange value of the united states dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by the company s international operations 
as a result  the company s operating and financial results can be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company employs a foreign currency hedging program 
see market risk management foreign currency exchange risk  below 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from global and localized economic  business and political conditions 
the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states  including changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  tariffs  quotas  difficulty in obtaining export licenses  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors outside the company s control 
there can be no assurances these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial results in the future 
market risk management foreign currency exchange risk the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments relates primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company seeks opportunities to reduce exposures through financing activities 
foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are also used to reduce foreign currency exposures 
all foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are authorized and executed pursuant to the company s policies 
foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts that are designated as and qualify as hedging transactions are subject to hedge accounting treatment 
the company does not hold or issue derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the company s financial instruments and off balance sheet risks 
the company has a financing agreement with a bank that provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
gains and losses associated with changes in the underlying foreign currencies are deferred during the commitment period and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment at the time the bank purchases the promissory notes 
see liquidity and capital resources available financing lines for a description of the financing agreement 
the company periodically utilizes foreign currency options  generally with maturities of less than one year  to hedge a portion of its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated revenue from its international operations 
gains and losses associated with the options are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the underlying revenue transactions 
to the extent an option is terminated or ceases to be effective as a hedge  any gains and losses as of that date are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the underlying revenue transaction 
the company also utilizes forward exchange contracts  generally with maturities of less than two months  to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies and anticipated revenue from its international operations 
the carrying amounts of these forward exchange contracts equal their fair values as the contracts are adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities are recognized as incurred within sg a on the consolidated statement of operations as adjustments to the foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of net monetary assets 
gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge anticipated revenue are recognized as incurred as adjustments to revenue 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates applied to the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments held as of december   and as of december   would result in a hypothetical loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in the hypothetical loss for is primarily due to an increase in outstanding foreign currency forwards and commitments associated with promissory notes denominated in foreign currencies 
these hypothetical losses do not take into consideration the company s underlying international operations 
the company anticipates that any hypothetical loss associated with the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments would be offset by gains associated with its underlying international operations 
factors that may affect future results new products and services the company s results of operations and competitive strength depend upon its ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market innovative new products and services 
short product life cycles are inherent in the high technology market 
the company must devote significant resources to research and product development projects and effectively manage the risks inherent in new product transitions 
developing new technology  products and services is complex and involves uncertainties 
the company introduced a significant number of new products in october including the storagenet tm  the high capacity tape drive  and virtual storage manager r iii  as well as enhancements to the shared virtual array tm 
delays in product development  manufacturing  or in customer evaluation and purchasing decisions may make product transitions difficult 
the manufacture of new products involves integrating complex designs and processes  collaborating with sole source suppliers for key components and increasing manufacturing capacities to accommodate demand 
a design flaw  the failure to obtain sufficient quantities of key components or manufacturing constraints could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results 
the company has experienced product development delays in the past that adversely affected the company s financial results and competitive position 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully manage the development and introduction of new products  services and software in the future 
emerging markets the company is focusing significant resources on product offerings for the client server market 
competition in the client server market is aggressive and is based primarily upon performance  quality  system scalability  price  service and name recognition 
the client server market includes a broad range of customers including customers outside of the company s traditional customer base 
many of the company s potential customers in the client server market purchase their storage requirements as part of a bundled product  which may provide a competitive advantage to the company s rivals 
the company expects to address these competitive factors through the delivery of storage solutions that provide customers with superior functionality  performance and quality 
the storage networking market has only recently begun to develop and is characterized by rapidly changing technology and standards 
because this market is new  it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate 
customers may be reluctant to adopt new data storage standards  and competing standards may emerge that will be preferred by customers 
competition the markets for the company s products and services are intensely competitive and are subject to continuous  rapid technological change  frequent product performance improvements  short product life cycles and aggressive pricing 
the company competes in a number of markets that include a broad spectrum of customers primarily on the basis of technology  product availability  performance  quality  reliability  price  distribution and customer service 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on a number of factors  both within and outside of its control 
these factors include the price and cost of the company s and its competitors product offerings  the timing and success of new products and applications  new product introductions by the company s competitors and general economic and business conditions within and outside the united states 
strong competition has resulted in price erosion in the past and the company expects this trend to continue 
the company expects that the markets for its products and services  and its competitors within these markets  will continue to change in response to shifting customer storage requirements and technological advances 
the company s competitors include  among others  advanced digital information corporation  compaq computer corporation  emc corporation  hewlett packard company  hitachi ltd  ibm  network appliance inc  quantum corporation  and sun microsystems 
a number of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial resources than the company 
partners competitors the markets in which the company competes are characterized by various alliances formed to promote industry standards and deliver tested  interoperable technology 
for example  seagate technology  inc  ibm and hewlett packard company have jointly developed the linear tape open drive  or lto  a high capacity tape drive technology for the mid range market 
the company is currently developing versions of its tape libraries that will support lto tape drives 
however  the company may be at a cost disadvantage in manufacturing tape libraries that use lto tape drives 
the company also competes with vendors with which it has established relationships  including legato systems  inc and veritas software corporation 
the company anticipates that it will continue to establish distribution alliances with other equipment manufacturers  software vendors and service providers to address competitive factors 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully realize the benefits from these alliances at the same time it competes against these same companies 
significant personnel changes the company has experienced significant changes in its executive officers 
on july   patrick j 
martin was selected as the company s new chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  replacing david e 
weiss  who resigned from the same positions immediately prior to mr 
martin s appointment 
since the selection of mr 
martin  the company has announced the departure of two executive officers and the appointment of three current executive officers to new positions 
it may take a period of time before the new executive management team becomes fully productive 
the company experienced increased turnover in its sales force in the first half of as a result of its restructuring activities 
while the company has completed the rehiring of most of these sales positions  financial results continue to be adversely affected as the company is still in the process of delivering the product training and sales tools to increase the effectiveness of its sales force in the united states and canada 
the company has experienced significant changes in the remainder of its employee base as a result of the voluntary and involuntary severance programs implemented in connection with its restructuring activities  as well as increased levels of employee attrition 
the future success of the company depends in large part on its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
the company faces significant competition for individuals with the skills required to deliver the products and services offered to its customers 
an inability to successfully deliver products and services required by its customers could have an adverse effect on future operating results 
ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights the company relies heavily upon its ability to develop new intellectual property rights that do not infringe upon the rights of others in order to remain competitive and develop and manufacture products that are competitive in terms of technology and cost 
there is no assurance that the company will continue to be able to develop such new intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of united states patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect its intellectual property rights 
with respect to certain of the company s international operations  the company does file patent applications with foreign governments 
however  many foreign countries do not have as well developed laws as the united states in protecting intellectual property 
the company enters into confidentiality agreements relating to its intellectual property with its employees and consultants 
in addition  the company includes confidentiality provisions in license and non exclusive sales agreements with its indirect distributors and its customers 
despite all of the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use the company s intellectual property 
monitoring the unauthorized use of the company s intellectual property rights is difficult  particularly in foreign countries 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to protect its intellectual property rights  particularly in foreign countries 
sole source suppliers the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products and believes that  in most cases  there are a number of alternative  competent vendors for most of those parts and components 
many non standard parts are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
however  there are other vendors who could produce these parts in satisfactory quantities after a period of pre qualification and product ramping 
certain key components and products are purchased from single source suppliers that the company believes are currently the only manufacturers of the particular components that meet the company s qualification requirements and other specifications or for which alternative sources of supply are not readily available 
imation corporation is a single source supplier for the and tape cartridges and the company is dependent on imation to economically produce large volumes of high quality tape cartridges for the and product at a cost acceptable to the company and its customers 
ibm is currently a single source supplier for disk drives used in the company s sva and vsm products 
ibm has indicated these drives will no longer be manufactured after june the company is developing an industry standard interface drive for its sva and vsm products 
this project is in the engineering and development stage 
the company has entered into a final purchase commitment with ibm and believes it will be able to accurately forecast the required number of drives to meet future demand until the new technology becomes available 
failure to accurately forecast future demand for these products could result in excess inventory and related inventory write offs  or the inability to meet customer needs for these products 
certain suppliers have experienced occasional technical  financial or other problems in the past that have delayed deliveries 
during the third quarter of  the company s supply of flex circuits and transducer semiconductor components for the tape drives were delayed due to manufacturing problems experienced by suppliers 
an unanticipated failure of any sole source supplier to meet the company s requirements for an extended period  or the inability to secure comparable components in a timely manner  could result in a shortage of key components  longer lead times  and reduced control over production and delivery schedules 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on revenue and operating results 
in the event a sole source supplier was unable or unwilling to continue to supply components  the company would need to identify and qualify other acceptable suppliers 
this process could take an extended period  and no assurance can be given that any additional source would become available or would be able to satisfy production requirements on a timely basis or at a price acceptable to the company 
the company is dependent upon a sole subcontractor  herald datanetics ltd 
hdl  to manufacture a key component used in certain tape products 
hdl is located in the people s republic of china prc 
to date  the company has not experienced any material problems with hdl 
the company s dependence on hdl is subject to additional risks beyond those associated with other sole suppliers  including the lack of a well established court system or acceptance of the rule of law in the prc  the degree to which the prc permits economic reform policies to continue  the political relationship between the prc and the united states and broader political and economic factors  such as whether the prc is admitted to the world trade organization 
manufacturing a significant portion of the company s products is manufactured in facilities located in puerto rico 
the company s ability to manufacture product may be impacted by weather related risks beyond the control of the company 
if the puerto rico manufacturing facility were impacted by such an event  the company may not have an alternative source to meet the demand for its products without substantial delays and disruption to its operations 
the company carries interruption insurance to mitigate some of the risk 
there is no assurance that the company could obtain sufficient alternate manufacturing sources or repair the facilities in a timely manner to satisfy the demand for its products 
failure to fulfill manufacture demands could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results in the future 
the company  along with the computer industry as a whole  has experienced delivery delays  increased lead times in ordering parts and components for its products  and rapid changes in the demand by customers for certain products 
these longer lead times coupled with rapid changes in the demand for products  could result in a shortage of parts and components and result in reduced control over delivery schedules and an inability to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner 
the complexities of these issues are increased while the company transitions to newer technologies and products 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on revenue and operating results 
volatility of stock price earnings fluctuations the company s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in trading price 
the company s stock price may be impacted if the company s revenue or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community 
the company s stock price may also be affected by broad economic and market trends  which are unrelated to the company s performance 
the company s financial and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of reasons 
many of the company s customers undertake significant procedures relating to the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of the company s products 
this evaluation process results in a variable sales cycle  and makes it difficult to predict if or when revenue will be earned 
in the past  the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern  which reflects the tendency of customers to make their purchase decisions at the end of a calendar year 
during any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large portion of the total product sales is recognized in the last weeks and days of the quarter 
a number of other factors may also cause revenue to fall below expectations  such as product and technology transitions announced by the company or its competitors  delays in the availability of new products  changes in the purchasing patterns of the company s customers and distribution partners  or adverse global economic conditions 
the mix of sales among the company s business segments and sales concentration in particular geographic regions may carry different gross profit margins and may cause the company s operating margins to fluctuate and impact earnings 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently difficult 
because the company plans its operating expenses on expected revenue  a shortfall in revenue may cause earnings to be below expectations in that period 
risks associated with the year the company s product lines include information storage products which collect  move  store  share and protect data 
in order to process data properly  the company s products must successfully manage and manipulate data that includes both th and st century dates year issue 
there have not been any significant product warranty claims  business disruptions or internal information system failures as a result of the year issue
