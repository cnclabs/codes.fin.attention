part i item business general riddell is a leading marketer and manufacturer of branded products and services to the extracurricular activities portion of the educational market 
we believe that the extracurricular activities market encompasses approximately million young men and women in the united states who participate in team sports and other organized activities outside the classroom 
we estimate that this market exceeds billion in sales annually  including approximately billion of sales in athletic equipment and uniforms for team sports and various products and services for cheerleaders and dancers 
under our many brands  the best known of which are riddell and varsity spirit  which we own  and umbro  which we license  we are o a leading provider of athletic equipment and clothing for team sports  o the only national reconditioner of football protective and other athletic equipment  o the largest designer  marketer and supplier of innovative cheerleader and dance team uniforms and accessories  o the biggest operator of cheerleading and dance team training camps and clinics  o a leading organizer of special events for extracurricular activities  o a major provider of soccer apparel  equipment and footwear for team play  o a supplier of sports collectible products through retailers in the united states and internationally  and o a major provider of studio dance conventions and competitions 
we have built our various brands and lines of business  in large part  based upon our long standing marketing strategy through which our direct  proprietary sales force establishes and builds relationships with the participants  coaches and instructors among the  junior and senior high schools  colleges and various youth organizations throughout the united states 
we believe that our sales force is unique within the extracurricular activities market and provides us with a significant competitive advantage 
we employ our relationship marketing strategy year round  integrating it with our other activities  including conducting training camps  clinics and conventions and producing various nationally televised and regional championships in the us and performance events in the us and europe 
these activities  which are in themselves profitable  reinforce each other and the sale of our products  while they enhance participation in the extracurricular market and build loyalty to our brands 
we believe that more than of all high school and collegiate football players either wear our football helmets or use other branded football equipment sold by us 
we also have a longstanding agreement with the nfl for the promotion of our riddell brand 
over of the nfl players choose to wear our helmets 
we also use the riddell brand to sell sports collectible products through retailers in the us and internationally 
we believe that our varsity spirit brand cheerleading uniforms are worn by more high school and college cheerleaders than any other brand 
our cheerleading camps were attended by more than  students in  more than  people traveled to the walt disney resort in orlando  florida to participate in and view our various cheerleading and dance competitions 
we are a delaware corporation that was formed in to acquire the riddell brand football protective equipment business 
in  we effected an initial public offering of our common stock 
since  we have been distributing our products to the extracurricular market directly  rather than through dealers 
in  we acquired varsity spirit corporation  a leader in the spirit industry 
at the end of  we became the exclusive us licensee for umbro branded soccer team apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories for the team channel of distribution 
umbro is one of the leading soccer brands worldwide 
we believe that the umbro license complements our existing product lines 
our strategy is to increase our current market share and broaden the recognition of our brands in the extracurricular market 
we intend to implement this strategy by o continuing to focus on opportunities to market additional products and services to our traditional customers in our team sports and school spirit business  o developing special events  competitions and championships to create new relationships with participants in extracurricular activities that we are currently not serving effectively  such as youth baseball  and o expanding the size of our sales force 
recent developments on march   our subsidiary  varsity fashions and supplies  inc filed a lawsuit in the southern district of new york against umbro worldwide  ltd 
and its related companies seeking to prevent certain breaches by umbro of its agreement with varsity pertaining to  inter alia  its sale of products into the united states via the internet and its threatened change of market positioning of certain umbro products previously sold by signal apparel  inc we do not believe the lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the company 
business segments we presently employ our sales and marketing strategy and operate our business through various wholly owned subsidiaries in three business segments 
extracurricular our extracurricular segment  which we have historically referred to as our institutional segment  markets  manufactures and distributes products and services primarily through our approximately person direct sales force to customers such as schools  recreational groups and other organizations 
it is our largest segment  and was responsible for over of our revenues in retail our retail segment markets products through retailers in the us and internationally  and was responsible for approximately of our revenues in most of the products sold by this segment are sports collectible products  such as authentic and replica football helmets which bear licensed national football league and collegiate team logos 
we also have a license from major league baseball 
this segment s operations also include sales of a limited amount of recreational football  baseball and other athletic products sold internationally and in the us through consumer product retailers and distributors 
licensing our licensing segment consists of the licensing of our riddell and macgregor trademark rights to other entities for use in marketing products such as athletic footwear and equipment  and was responsible for approximately of our revenues in financial information for each of our three business segments is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
extracurricular segment we believe that we are a leading marketer and manufacturer of branded products and services to the extracurricular portion of the us educational market 
today  our extracurricular products and services segment includes our team sports and school spirit business units 
the extracurricular activities market includes most of the organized activities for children that take place outside of classrooms in the united states 
it includes team sports  school spirit activities  private dance groups  bands  orchestras  choirs and a wide variety of other school sponsored clubs  such as drama  debate and chess and is serviced by a highly fragmented range of suppliers 
these activities take place in approximately  junior and senior high schools and in colleges  as well as in youth leagues and organizations like little league  pop warner and parks and recreation leagues 
in addition to the million participants in high school team sports in the us  we estimate that there are an additional million participants in team sports in youth leagues and junior high schools 
we also estimate that there are an additional million participants in other extracurricular activities  such as school sponsored cheerleading  bands and choirs and youth who take dance lessons at private studios 
we estimate that spending by these various participants on the extracurricular activities that we are already targeting exceeds billion a year and represents aggregate spending of over billion annually 
team sports we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of football helmets  which we sell under our riddell brand 
our riddell brand football helmets are worn by football players throughout the world  including players on all nfl teams  certain other professional leagues and on most teams in the ncaa 
high school teams  however  have historically been the largest market for our football helmets 
we offer several types of competitive and youth football helmets which are different in their configurations  padding and other features 
our helmets meet the industry standards set by the national operational committee for safety in athletic equipment  an independent entity organized by various participants from the sporting goods industry which establishes industry wide standards for protective athletic equipment 
we also sell a professional and collegiate line of shoulder pads under the power r name and several other lines of shoulder pads under the riddell name 
our shoulder pads are used by nfl  college  high school and youth players 
we have been steadily widening the categories of athletic products we sell to the extracurricular market 
in  we introduced a line of baseball and softball products designed for high school and college players and expanded this line to the youth market in in late  we also introduced a line of custom team uniforms for high school and youth participants 
game uniforms we believe that the game uniform market for team sports is a larger market than our other team sports products and services lines of business 
in  we introduced a line of athletic game uniforms for the team sports market 
we are seeking to capitalize on the efficiency and expertise obtained through the manufacture of our custom made cheerleading and dance team uniforms by applying the same design and manufacturing techniques to the production of athletic game uniforms 
at the end of  we also began offering umbro team soccer uniforms  equipment and apparel  through a network of independent sales representatives 
these independent sales representatives market and sell umbro team soccer apparel  footwear and equipment to the team channel of distribution in the united states 
reconditioning we are the leading national reconditioner of football helmets  shoulder pads and athletic equipment 
we believe that our share of the reconditioning market exceeds 
reconditioning typically involves the cleaning  sanitizing  buffing or painting  and recertifying of helmets as conforming to the standards set by the national operational committee for safety in athletic equipment 
reconditioning may also include replacing face guards  interior pads and chin straps 
we also recondition shoulder pads  as well as equipment for other sports  including baseball and lacrosse helmets  catchers masks and baseball gloves 
our reconditioning services are marketed by our sales force to the same athletic coaches responsible for equipment purchases 
our reconditioning customers are primarily high schools  colleges and youth recreational groups 
school spirit cheerleader and dance team uniforms and accessories we design  market and manufacture cheerleader and dance team uniforms and accessories  including sweaters  sweatshirts  jumpers  vests  skirts  warm up suits  t shirts  shorts  pompons  socks  jackets  pins and gloves 
we market all of our cheerleading uniforms and accessories under the varsity spirit trademark 
approximately  catalogs are mailed annually to schools and school spirit advisors and coaches containing color photographs and descriptions of our varsity spirit line of uniforms and accessories 
we supplement our direct sales force and catalog sales efforts with a telemarketing sales force of full and part time employees 
cheerleader and dance team camps we operate cheerleader and dance team camps in the united states 
camp enrollment has increased every year since the camp division commenced operation in with cheerleading camps and  participants 
during the camp season  approximately  participants  consisting of students and their coaches  attended varsity s universal cheerleader association and united spirit association camps  including over  participants representing colleges and junior colleges 
during  cheerleading and or dance team squads from approximately of the universities comprising the atlantic coast  big east  big ten  big twelve  pacific and southeastern collegiate athletic conferences attended our camps 
a significant majority of our cheerleader and dance team camps are conducted on college or junior college campuses 
we contract with the colleges and universities for the provision of housing  food and athletic facilities 
our camps generally are conducted over a four day period and are attended by resident and commuting students 
our instructors are mostly college cheerleaders who may have previously attended our camp  and we believe that our training of many of the top college cheerleading squads augments our recruiting of high school and junior high school camp participants 
prior to the commencement of our camps  instructors participate in an intensive six day training session where they are taught new cheerleading and dance material 
we also place a high degree of emphasis on teaching our instructors the most up to date teaching  training and safety techniques 
we were a founding member of and remain an active participant in the american association of cheerleading coaches and advisors  an industry trade group whose mission is to improve the quality of cheerleading and to maintain established safety standards 
in  this industry trade group published comprehensive certification and safety guidelines for cheerleading coaches 
we follow the safety guidelines established by the association of cheerleading coaches and advisors in the training of our instructional staff and in the conduct of our cheerleader and dance team camps and competitions 
special events we promote our varsity spirit brand products and services  as well as the school spirit industry  through active and visible association with the following annual championships and television specials o national high school cheerleading championship r o national dance team championship r o college cheerleading and dance team national championship r o national all star cheerleading championship r o company dance championship r these championships and special events have been regularly televised on the espn television network and have been sponsored by various companies and products  including nike  degree  at t  pond s  the walt disney world resort  johnson johnson and claire s accessories 
in addition to promoting cheerleading and dance team activities  these championships  television specials and events are a source of revenues for us 
in  over  persons  including cheerleaders and their families  attended our special events 
other extracurricular operations we are continuing to expand our uniform design  manufacturing and special event expertise from cheerleading into the private dance studio market through our venture called company dance 
in june  we acquired certain of the assets of the netherland corporation starlight productions  one of the larger studio dance competition companies 
while starlight productions historical operations and assets are not material in comparison to our financial statements  we feel that this acquisition combined with our existing company dance convention business will help us to expand our entree into the studio dance business 
company dance operates weekend dance conventions and competitions in twenty nine us cities  an annual convention championship from the walt disney resort in orlando that is televised on espn and two annual competition championships 
we also operate intropa  a tour company  which specializes in organizing trips for cheerleaders  bands  choirs and orchestras  dance and theater groups and other school affiliated or performing groups  which tour in the continental united states  hawaii  canada  europe and israel 
relationship marketing our marketing model is based upon our longstanding relationships with three distinct but equally important groups 
first  our direct sales organization  through personalized service  creates an important connection to the participants  coaches and instructors of various team sports  school spirit activities and other extracurricular activities in schools  youth leagues and organizations and colleges 
second  instructors and staff at our camps  clinics and performance tours and events motivate participants to get more instruction and become better competitors 
third  we increase our brand awareness and enhance our relationships with our customers through our affiliations with strategic partners such as the walt disney company  espn and other media and marketing entities 
these strategic relationships and the televised shows that we produce reinforce the importance of our events and competitions 
our extracurricular segment is supported and based upon our sales and marketing strategy  which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage  and features the following key components 
o our proprietary  direct sales force o cross marketing of products and promotional activities o camps and clinics o special events  conventions and competitions o uniforms and accessories o key marketing alliances o internet operations proprietary  direct sales force our comprehensive relationship marketing and sales strategy is made possible by our approximately person direct sales force who are responsible for developing and maintaining relationships among the  junior and senior high schools  and colleges in the united states 
we believe that there is no other nationwide direct sales force focusing on the product lines that we sell to the extracurricular branch of the educational market and that this gives us a significant competitive advantage 
our sales force develops relationships with coaches and athletic directors throughout the us by providing value added services that enhance the coach s management of his team 
examples of this include providing clinics  fitting football helmets and equipment  and quickly servicing  designing and fitting custom uniforms for participants in cheerleading and team sports 
over the last several years  we have been increasing the size of our sales force  and intend to continue to do so over the next few years 
increasing the size of the sales force goes hand in hand with expanding the array of products and services marketed by the sales force 
in this way  we can shrink the size of sales territories  while sales people become more efficient and increase their incomes 
as a result  we are seeking to make it easier for each salesperson to better concentrate on and become more intimate with a smaller sales territory  while at the same time having more products and services to offer to the customers in that territory 
the desired effect is to enable each salesperson to generate increased sales by spending less time traveling and more time with customers selling a greater array of products and services 
increased sales enables the sales force to increase their incomes  because their compensation is commission based and smaller territories can also increase their incomes because our salespeople pay for all of their travel and other related expenses 
cross marketing and promotional activities since  we have conducted  and we continue to refine  profit generating activities  which are an integral part of our promotional efforts 
we create relationships through our camps and events and believe that these relationships naturally translate to a sales opportunity for our cheerleading uniforms or dance costumes when the campers return to school 
when the sales force interacts with cheerleaders or dance team participants and their coaches during the design and fitting of custom uniforms  they also have the opportunity to reinforce participation in our camps and special events 
we intend to extend this strategy to other extracurricular activities 
the marketing of our various activities is designed to provide logical extensions to basic participation and to encourage participants  as they improve  to increasingly utilize more of our products and services 
all of our marketing activities are designed so that each of our various products and services reinforce one another  as well as strengthen overall brand awareness and loyalty 
how we cross market is evident from our marketing of special events and competitions for cheerleaders 
for example  in order to participate in the various special events that we offer  such as the nationally televised macy s thanksgiving day parade in new york city  a cheerleader must attend and excel at one of our camps 
our camps are the only place that a cheerleader can get an invitation to appear in one of our special events 
similarly  we hold local cheerleading competitions that progress to various regional levels during the course of the fall  which are the only way for a team to qualify for our championships which are held at the walt disney resort in orlando  florida and nationally televised on espn 
camps events our approach to relationship building has inter related parts 
in the case of cheerleading it is our camps which  more than anything else  build brand loyalty 
special events  conventions and competitions enhance our relationship marketing 
just as our camps build loyalty with respect to cheerleading  special events  conventions and competitions  for other extracurricular activities can build new allegiances from participants in a wide variety of other extracurricular activities 
we run regional and national cheerleading and dance team competitions  organize national dance competitions for young individuals and sponsor youth soccer tournaments 
the national competitions and finals for these activities are typically held at the walt disney resort in orlando  florida and are televised on espn and or espn participants in the school spirit activities that we target are also given the opportunity to take part in various performance events in the us and europe 
these events include parades  such as the annual macy s thanksgiving day parade in new york city and year end parades in london and paris 
we also arrange half time shows for college football bowl games 
we intend to extend our promotional activities to a greater number of extracurricular activities with soccer and dance the most likely next additions 
uniforms and accessories the cheerleaders who participate in our special events  such as parades  often come from a variety of schools 
they each need a uniform for the special event so that they can portray a unified appearance 
we design and sell such uniforms and also sell a travel package  including hotel arrangements  to the participants in our special events 
at the same time  because participation in our various promotional activities enhances our bond with cheerleaders  we believe that their team is more likely to buy our uniforms and accessories 
key marketing alliances we have a promotional rights agreement with the nfl s licensing division which requires that our riddell brand name appear on the front or back of all of our helmets used in nfl play 
our agreement with the nfl requires all teams in the nfl to cover any indicia of brand identification of any other manufacturers that might otherwise appear on helmets  face masks or chin straps not manufactured by us  but used during league play 
in return  we agree to supply specified quantities of riddell helmets  shoulder pads and related equipment  either at no cost or at reduced cost to each nfl team which has a requisite percentage of its roster using the riddell helmet 
presently  over of nfl players choose to wear our riddell brand football helmets 
the nfl agreement  which dates back to  has a term expiring in april  but is automatically extended for successive five year periods provided that the quality of riddell s helmets remain comparable to the best available technology as reasonably determined by the nfl 
we also have longstanding marketing alliances with other strategic partners such as the walt disney company  espn and other media and marketing entities 
we are currently in our th year of broadcasting championship events on espn and espn  and our current agreement with espn extends through the year we have been holding championship events at the walt disney world resort in orlando florida since  and our current agreement with the walt disney company extends through the year all of these alliances serve to further emphasize the prominence and importance of the activity and the participant 
all of these marketing relationships also enhance one another and serve to reinforce and cross market our products and services 
internet operations we believe that our internet operations  which are described further below  are a logical extension and application of this approach and are designed to enhance our contact with customers and build brand loyalty 
production team sports products we design  manufacture and package all of our full sized football and baseball batting helmets at our plant in chicago  illinois 
our elk grove  illinois warehouse facility has a screen printing operation which can customize practicewear and uniforms with almost any logo  team name or other design or numbering that a customer requests 
power shoulder pads are manufactured for us by a single source in canada  vortex sales and marketing  inc  and we have a facility in pennsylvania that can customize these shoulder pads 
as is the case with all of our material suppliers  however  we do not have a long term agreement with vortex for our shoulder pads 
all of our other shoulder pads are imported as finished products from sources in the far east 
we purchase our baseball products  other than baseball batting helmets  from suppliers in the far east and we source our practicewear from domestic suppliers 
athletic uniforms are purchased on a made to order basis from domestic suppliers 
all of our manufactured protective products are subjected to at least four separate quality control procedures 
quality control inspections for helmets are conducted when the product is molded  when liners are inserted  when face guards are attached and when the product is finished  and samples of all models produced are tested in accordance with national operational committee for safety in athletic equipment standards 
we continually monitor our products for quality 
all adult competitive protective football helmet shells are covered by a five year warranty and youth football helmet shells are covered by a three year warranty 
helmet liners  protective padding and shoulder pads are covered by a one year warranty 
principal raw materials purchased by us for use in our protective products include various custom and standard grades of resins  plastic and foam as well as metal fasteners  paints and cardboard 
similar materials are used in most purchased components and finished products along with steel wire used in purchased face guard components and textile products used in purchased practicewear and athletic uniforms 
we purchase resin  which is an integral component in the manufacture of helmets  for our competitive helmets from a single supplier  a division of the general electric company  although we do not have a long term agreement with general electric 
we believe  however  that alternative sources of supply could be arranged without any material harm to our business 
we employ an engineering staff principally with respect to the design  development and improvement of our helmets and shoulder pads and to the testing of raw materials which are used in our products or in the development of new products 
we have eight employees mainly devoted to design  development and quality and have several patents and patents pending that are applicable to our protective products 
reconditioning our reconditioning services include the sanitizing  buffing or painting  replacing certain parts and recertifying of athletic equipment as conforming to national operational committee for safety in athletic equipment standards 
these services are performed at our reconditioning facilities which are located throughout the united states 
cheerleading and dance team uniforms and accessories most of the cheerleading and dance team uniforms designed  manufactured and marketed by us are made to order 
during  we contracted for our production requirements with eleven independent us garment manufacturers 
the manufacturers provide knitting  cutting  sewing  finishing and shipping  and we provide the patterns  fabrics  yarn and manufacturing specifications and quality control supervision 
we also provide some cutting  knitting and lettering at two specialized production facilities 
the use of independent manufacturing facilities to fulfill our production needs affords us with the flexibility to adjust our production output to meet our highly seasonal selling cycle 
the use of independent manufacturers also reduces our fixed costs  which we believe is beneficial in a highly seasonal business 
cheerleading accessories such as shoes  pompons and campwear are purchased from various suppliers including nike  adidas  converse  body wrappers  and top sox  among others 
we have expanded the variety and number of accessories we market  which has contributed to the increase in our revenues in recent years 
retail segment our retail segment markets our riddell branded products through retailers and distributors in the united states  and to a lesser extent internationally 
although we sell some recreational football and baseball equipment  most of the products sold by our retail segment are sports collectibles 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched a web site for our collectibles  www 
riddell 
com 
our sports collectibles are sold under licenses from nfl properties  which has granted us a license to use the names  symbols  emblems  designs and colors of the member clubs of the nfl and the league marks such as national football league  nfl  afc  super bowl  pro bowl  the nfl shield design and other insignia adopted by the nfl on authentic and replica football helmets sold for display purposes to fans and collectors 
we also have licenses from most major colleges and major league baseball 
we sell football helmets in various miniature and full sized models 
we also sell lamps and desk organizers bearing the colors and logos of nfl and college football teams 
we sell miniature baseball batter s helmets and lamps under licenses from major league baseball 
marketing sales and promotion the products in our retail segment are primarily sold to retail and specialty sporting goods stores and distributors through independent commissioned sales representatives 
we use different price points and product types to strategically target different channels of retail trade 
in support of our sports collectible products  we have initiated various advertising and public relations efforts 
advertisements are placed in publications targeted toward the sports collectible industry as well as other licensed products retailers 
we also provide incentives to retail outlets to advertise and display riddell products during promotional periods and participate in a major national sporting goods show where we promote our products 
the retail segment also benefits from the promotional exposure under the nfl agreement described above within the extracurricular segment 
production we engineer  manufacture and package our full size collectible helmets at our plant in chicago  illinois in a process similar to that used for our competitive helmets 
we purchase our miniature helmets and other collectible products principally from two sources in china 
we have retained a design company to assist us in developing new retail collectible products on terms that we believe are customary in the industry and from time to time we work with other design companies 
athletic products sold as part of the retail segment are manufactured or purchased  together with similar products sold through our extracurricular segment 
licensing segment we license our riddell and macgregor trademarks to third parties for use on various products  including clothing  footwear and balls 
we are continually exploring additional opportunities for licensing the macgregor and riddell trademarks and retain the services of an independent licensing agent to assist our worldwide efforts in this regard 
the licensing segment also benefits from the promotional exposure of our agreement with the nfl because it gives our riddell brand national television exposure on a weekly basis during the football season 
riddell licensing we license the riddell trademark to third parties for certain types of casual clothing  socks and athletic footwear 
we license the riddell name for use on footwear 
under the terms of a settlement agreement reached in with the bankruptcy trustee for macgregor sporting goods  inc  and others  we have ceded all of the royalties from this license until the earlier of the second half of or such time as the license produces million plus interest of royalties to certain third parties 
macgregor licensing we have granted kmart corporation a non exclusive license to use the macgregor trademark on athletic socks until june  kmart does not intend to renew the license and we plan to re license the trademarks 
we have also granted footstar  inc an exclusive license to use the macgregor trademark on athletic footwear sold at kmart stores under a license with an initial term expiring on june  we have agreed with footstar  in principle  to a renewal and an amendment to the license  and the documentation is currently being completed 
in  we granted a license for use of our macgregor trademark on team sports products sold to retailers 
we also amended an existing macgregor license for team sports sold to the extracurricular segment which had been royalty free  to provide for royalties to be paid to us 
our internet operations we believe that we can take advantage of commercial opportunities offered by electronic community building and commerce as it relates to the extracurricular activities market because we have the largest nationwide proprietary sales force in the us in the extracurricular activities market 
we believe that our internet strategy of building community sites and simultaneously establishing complementary commerce sites affords us an opportunity to extend our relationship sales and marketing strategy to expand our core business and to develop new lines of business 
we launched our internet business in the fourth quarter of with our first two web sites a community web site with e commerce elements for cheerleaders  www 
varsity 
com  and our e commerce web site for our sports collectibles  www 
riddell 
com 
in the third quarter of we launched www 
codance 
com  our website for company dance 
seasonality and backlog our operations are highly seasonal 
in recent years  our operations have been most profitable in the second and third quarters  with the third quarter typically the strongest  while losses have typically been incurred in the first and fourth quarters 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited operating results of riddell for each of the four quarters in and you should read this information together with the consolidated financial statements  the notes related to those financial statements and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter in thousands year ended december  revenues     percent of total annual revenues 
operating income loss     net income loss     year ended december  revenues     percent of total annual revenues 
operating income loss     net income loss     net income for the third quarter of included income tax expense of  relating to the valuation of deferred taxes 
this seasonal pattern is influenced by the following factors o orders and shipments for our extracurricular segment s athletic products and reconditioning services are solicited over a sales cycle that begins late in the fall of each year and continues until just before the start of a new school year at the end of the following summer 
delivery of products and performance of reconditioning services reach a low point in the fall of each year after school begins and during the football playing season 
these activities contribute most to profitability in the first through third quarters of each calendar year 
o cheerleading and dance uniforms and accessories are typically ordered and shipped between late march  when new cheerleaders are selected for the coming school year  and the end of august  just before the new school year begins 
o most of the extracurricular segment s camp revenues relate to our cheerleading camps 
we incur costs relating to our camp business during the first and second quarter as we prepare for the upcoming camp season  while most revenue relating to the camps is earned during the period from june to august 
company dance competitions and conventions primarily take place during the first and second quarters which may temper this segment s seasonality 
o our retail segment s sports collectible products are sold to retailers throughout the year 
however  sales are usually at their highest during the third and fourth quarters as retailers build inventory in anticipation of both the football and the holiday shopping seasons 
o the sale of umbro branded items is also seasonal  substantially following the pattern of our existing extracurricular athletic products as soccer  like football  is primarily a fall sport 
soccer  however experiences a spring season as well  which may somewhat temper the seasonality of the sale of umbro branded products 
our sales order backlog was million at february  compared to million at february  we expect substantially all of the backlog to be shipped within the calendar year 
competition athletic products our principal competitor in the football helmet market is schutt  manufacturer of the air helmet 
also  bike athletic co  inc has recently introduced a football helmet 
we compete principally with bike athletic co  inc  douglas  inc  gear  inc 
and rawlings sporting goods company  inc 
in the football shoulder pad business 
we compete principally with diamond sports co  rawlings sporting goods company  inc  wilson sporting goods company and other companies in baseball and softball products 
we also compete with champion products  inc  russell athletic  inc  and other companies for practicewear and athletic game uniforms 
we principally compete with adidas  nike  and other companies for soccer team apparel  footwear and equipment 
we also compete with numerous independent dealers throughout the united states who market our competitors products 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than us 
we believe that we compete in the football market on the basis of quality  price  reliability  service  comfort and ease of maintenance 
with respect to football and other athletic products  we believe that our direct sales force provides us with a competitive advantage in terms of our ability to provide superior customer service and that our factory direct pricing is a significant price advantage due to the elimination of independent dealers which are used by our competitors 
reconditioning reconditioners compete on the basis of quality  price  reputation  convenience and customer loyalty 
we believe that we are the largest nationwide participant among the approximately competitors in the highly fragmented athletic reconditioning industry 
spirit products and services we are one of two major companies that design and market cheerleader  dance team and booster club uniforms and accessories on a national basis 
besides us and our major national competitor  national spirit group  there are many other smaller regional competitors serving the uniform and accessories market in the united states 
we believe that the principal factors governing the selection of cheerleader and dance team uniforms and accessories are the quality  variety  design  delivery  service and  to a lesser extent  price 
we are also one of two companies that annually operate a significant number of cheerleader and dance team camps in the united states  again the other being national spirit group 
there are also many other smaller companies and schools that operate cheerleading camps and clinics on a regional basis 
we believe that the principal factors governing the selection of a cheerleader or dance team camp or clinic are the reputation of the camp operator for providing quality instruction and supervision  location  schedule and the tuition charged for camp participation 
we compete with showbiz  starpower  showstoppers  tremaine  west coast dance explosion  new york city dance alliance  and other smaller national and regional companies in operating studio dance conventions and competitions 
we believe the principal factors governing the selection of a studio dance convention or competition are the reputation of the dance operator for providing quality instruction and supervision  location  schedule and tuition charged for convention competition 
retail collectible products our collectible products compete with a large number and wide array of manufacturers and sellers of sports and other collectible and memorabilia products  some of which have greater resources than us 
among our competitors in this large marketplace are sellers of products such as autographed photographs and uniforms and other memorabilia and manufacturers of clothing  such as caps and jackets 
licensing competition in the licensing of sports equipment  apparel and footwear is substantial  and the riddell and macgregor brands compete with numerous companies also having significant brand recognition  many of which have greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources 
brand recognition and reputation for quality are important competitive factors in the licensing of sports apparel and footwear 
competing brands include adidas r  champion r  converse r  nike r  rawlings r  reebok r  russell r and wilson r 
patents and trade secrets some of our football helmet liner systems and other items are protected by patents and trade secrets  including a patent on our inflatable liner expiring in other patents on the liners will expire in we also have patents expiring in  and on various components of our shoulder pads which improve absorption of shock 
trademarks and service marks we own various common law and registered trademarks in the us and various foreign countries including the following riddell  macgregor  proedge  power  air pac  warrior  biolite  maxpro  universal cheerleaders association  varsity spirit  united spirit association  co

our use of the macgregor trademark is limited by an agreement with global licensing corporation  which owns the similar trademark mcgregor 
under this agreement  the parties have agreed on certain restrictions in the use of their respective trademarks 
we do not have the macgregor trademark rights to golf products 
governmental regulation our products and accessories are subject to the federal consumer product safety act  which empowers the consumer product safety commission to protect consumers from hazardous sporting goods and other articles 
the consumer product safety commission has the authority to exclude from the market certain articles which are found to be hazardous and can require a manufacturer to repurchase such goods 
similar local laws exist in some states and cities in the united states  canada and europe 
we maintain a quality control program for our protective equipment operations and other products that is designed to comply with applicable laws 
to date  none of our products have been deemed to be hazardous by any governmental agency 
there is no national governing body regulating cheerleading and dance team activities at the collegiate level 
although voluntary guidelines relating to safety and sportsmanship have been issued by the ncaa and some of the athletic conferences  to date cheerleading and dance teams are generally free from rules and restrictions similar to those imposed on other competitive athletics at the college level 
however  if rules limiting off season training are applied to cheerleading and or dance teams similar to rules imposed by the ncaa on some inter collegiate sports  it is likely that we would be unable to offer a significant number of our camps either because participants would be prohibited from participating during the summer or because enough suitable sites would not be available 
although we are not aware of any school officially adopting these activities as a competitive sport  recognition of cheerleading and or dance teams as sports would increase the possibility that cheerleader or dance activities may become regulated 
we currently do not believe that any regulation of collegiate cheerleading or dance teams as a sport is forthcoming in the foreseeable future  and in the event any rules are proposed to be adopted by athletic associations  we expect to participate in the formulation of such rules to the extent permissible 
at the high school level  some state athletic associations have classified cheerleading as a sport and in some cases have imposed certain restrictions on off season practices and out of state travel to competitions 
however  in all cases to date  we have been able to work with these state athletic associations to designate acceptable times for the cheerleaders within these states to attend camps 
we have also signed agreements with several state associations to assist with sponsoring and executing official competitions within these states 
to date  state regulations have not had a material effect on our ability to conduct our normal business activities 
operations at all of our facilities are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health agency and various other regulatory agencies 
our operations are also subject to environmental regulations and controls 
while some of the raw materials used by us may be potentially hazardous  we have not received any material environmental citations or violations and have not been required to spend significant amounts to comply with applicable law 
employees at december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately  of these employees were employed on a full time basis and approximately were part time or temporary employees 
approximately employees employed in manufacturing at the chicago factory are represented by the chicago and central states joint board  amalgamated clothing and textile workers union  under a collective bargaining agreement which expires in march approximately of our employees working in reconditioning at our new york facility are represented by the local a united food and commercial workers union afl cio under a collective bargaining agreement which expires in january we have been discussing a renewal of this agreement with the union 
during the summer of  we employed approximately  summer camp instructors  trainers and administrators on a seasonal basis 
we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
insurance and product liability proceedings insurance we carry general liability insurance with coverage limits which we believe is adequate for our business 
we also maintain product liability insurance under an occurrence based policy providing coverage against all claims currently pending against us and future claims relating to injuries occurring between december and january even if such claims are filed after the end of the policy period 
the insurance program provides certain basic and excess coverages with combined aggregate coverage of over  subject to the limitations described below 
the first level of insurance coverage under the policy provides basic coverage of up to  per claim with an annual limit of  in excess of an uninsured retention deductible of  per occurrence 
this basic coverage has an aggregate limit which is currently  but the policy requires us to increase this maximum limit to  by paying a fixed annual payment or by prepaying the required premium at any time  which counts at of the amount paid toward the limit 
the insurance program also provides for additional coverage  which may be subject to certain state statutes limiting the applicability of such coverage in certain instances  of up to  per occurrence  in excess of the first  of each claim which is covered by the uninsured retention and basic coverage  to the extent available 
claims covered by this excess coverage are subject to one of two separate  aggregate policy limits  depending on the date of the related injury 
the first  aggregate limit applies to claims for injuries occurring prior to january  while claims occurring after january  are covered under the second separate  aggregate limit 
should either of these  aggregate limits become exhausted or impaired  in full or in part  the policy provides that riddell can reinstate the affected limit back to a full  level upon payment of a reinstatement premium 
each of the  aggregate limits may only be reinstated once and the reinstatement premium can vary from  to  depending on the amount of the reinstatement and which of the two aggregate limits is to be reinstated 
there is no certainty that coverage will remain available to us after january or that the insured amounts will be sufficient to cover all existing or future claims 
our product liability insurance carrier is a division of american international group  inc product liability proceedings we have historically been a defendant in product liability personal injury suits allegedly related to the use of football helmets manufactured or reconditioned by us 
as of march   nine product liability cases were pending against us 
in march  a jury rendered a verdict against us and two of our wholly owned subsidiaries  riddell  inc and all american sports corporation  in a texas lawsuit  in the aggregate amount of   of which was awarded on a product liability claim and  of which was awarded on a bystander emotional distress claim 
on february   the united states court of appeals for the fifth district overturned the bystander emotional distress claim and held that it could not be re tried 
the jury award on the product liability claim was also reversed and was remanded to the lower court 
we do not know whether the plaintiff will seek to retry the product liability case 
we have established reserves for pending product liability claims and determine our reserves based on the level of insurance that is available and estimates of losses and defense and settlement costs which we anticipate would result from such claims based on information available at the time the financial statements are issued 
due to the uncertainty involved with estimates  actual results have at times varied substantially from earlier estimates and could do so in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs of these claims or potential future claims will fall within the established reserves

ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to service indebtedness 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to income from operations or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as an indication of our operating performance or as a measure of our liquidity 
the measure of ebitda presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because ebitda is not a standardized measure of profitability or cash flow as defined by generally accepted accounting principals 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations set forth below is the percentage of our revenues generated by each of our three business segments in the years ended december   and extracurricular segment spirit and dance products and services team sports products and services total extracurricular segment retail segment licensing segment year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overview in  we achieved our first profitable year since the acquisition of varsity spirit in income from operations increased by million 
this improvement was achieved in spite of million of increased expenses relating to our internet operations and costs of a rights offering that was contemplated  but canceled during the year 
revenues increased both from the continued strong sales growth of newer product lines  including umbro branded soccer products and athletic game uniforms  as well as increased volume from our traditional lines of products and services 
we continued to benefit from actions taken in prior years to reduce costs and from the positive operating leverage that occurs as increased revenues more efficiently absorb the fixed  and relatively fixed  portion of operating costs 
our extracurricular segment continued to provide the vast majority of our operating income 
its operating income increased million from million in to million in this was driven by a million dollar increase in the operating income of the school spirit division 
operating income for our historical team sports operations increased million but was offset by operating losses of million from our umbro soccer operations 
revenues revenues in increased million  or  to million in comparison to revenues of million in all of the revenue gain came from our extracurricular segment where revenues increased or million  from million in to million in the extracurricular segment includes team sports and school spirit lines of products and services 
sales of team sports products and services grew by or million  from million in to million in sales of our umbro branded team soccer products and our new line of athletic game uniforms generated million of the increase 
we also benefited from a continued increased focus on sales to youth leagues as well as increased volume and generally higher selling prices on our traditional team sports products 
revenues from school spirit lines products and services grew by or million  from million in to million in more than half of the revenue growth came from increased volume of uniforms and accessories 
camp and event revenues increased as well with the number of camp participants growing by approximately  to  in revenues from the retail segment were million in  increasing slightly from in the increases related to sales of sports collectible products which were offset in part  by an internal shift in the responsibility for certain international customers of athletic equipment to the extracurricular segment 
royalty income from trademark licensing increased slightly in to million from just over million in gross profit gross profit in increased to million from million in gross margins decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the gross margin rate for the extracurricular segment decreased to in from in this decrease was largely due to a shift in product mix  as a portion of the segment s revenue gains occurred in product lines that carry below average margins 
margins from reconditioning operations were also lower in  as we continued to incur expenses from facilities slated for closure while we brought our new  more efficient reconditioning facility online 
while selling prices for extracurricular products and services were generally higher  margins were also negatively impacted by the sale of some discontinued umbro products at lower than normal margins 
gross margins for the retail segment increased to of revenues in from of revenues in the increase in margins in was principally due to a shift in product mix 
while trademark licensing does have some costs including selling  general and administrative expenses  there are no costs that are deducted in arriving at gross profit 
accordingly  any increase or decrease in royalty income results in a corresponding increase or decrease in gross profit for the licensing segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in increased by million from million in to million in this increase included million of increased commissions relating to higher sales  million higher expenses due to the start up of the athletic game uniform product line  a million increase in internet expenses and million relating to a cancelled rights offering 
despite these costs  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in this improvement is principally due to the improved absorption of the relatively fixed portions of selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from the increases in revenues  a continuation of a trend noted in prior periods 
extracurricular segment selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to of revenues in from in the improvement in the expense ratio was due to the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph 
retail segment selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to of revenues in from 
higher marketing expenses resulted in the increased expense rate 
licensing segment selling  general and administrative expenses were stable in comparison to the prior year  at just below million in both and interest expense interest expense in increased  or million over levels 
the increase related to our revolving line of credit and was due to an increase in average indebtedness and increases in the prime and libor interest rates 
outstanding indebtedness increased in line with working capital demands related to our line of umbro branded soccer products  which was still in its initial start up phase in the early part of  and volume growth in other product lines 
income taxes income tax expense in consisted of a provision for federal alternative minimum tax  with an offsetting deferred tax benefit  and a provision for current state income taxes 
income tax expense in reflects an adjustment relating to the valuation of deferred taxes 
no other net tax expense was recorded in or as we have net operating loss carry forwards which offset any such taxes 
the net loss carry forwards result from unrecognized tax benefits arising from net operating losses in years prior to the remaining unrecognized tax benefit would be utilized with the generation of approximately million of future pre tax income and adjustments 
we have certain nondeductible annual expenses that are added as adjustments to pretax income to calculate taxes 
these expenses include nondeductible amortization of approximately million  much of which arises from goodwill associated with the varsity acquisition 
the effect of these adjustments  as well as other items effecting our tax rates  are shown in the reconciliation of our tax provision to taxes based on statutory rates shown in note to our consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overview in  we achieved significant improvement in the profitability of our business 
income before taxes increased million  from a million loss in to a profit before taxes of million in revenues increased both from initial sales of new product lines as well as increased volume from our traditional lines of products and services 
we also began to see benefits from actions taken late in to reduce costs and improve profitability 
some of these actions resulted in charges that totaled million  which contributed to our loss in these charges included  classified as a restructuring charge and are discussed in more detail below in the discussion of the restructuring plan 
most of our operating improvement occurred in our extracurricular segment where operating income increased million from million in to million in we also achieved significant improvement in our retail segment which generated operating income of million in  up from operating income of under million in our pre tax profit in was achieved notwithstanding expenses and losses of approximately million relating primarily to two new initiatives  our strategy for the internet and our entry into the us team soccer market through our license from umbro  both of which provide us with significant growth potential 
the million includes approximately million of expenses incurred as we began to develop our internet operations and million of losses relating to the start up of our line of umbro branded team soccer products which began at the end of revenues revenues in increased million  or  to million in comparison to revenues of million in all of the revenue gain came from our extracurricular segment where revenues increased or million  from million in to million in the extracurricular segment includes team sports and school spirit lines of products and services 
sales of team sports products and services grew by or million  from million in to million in sales of our new line of umbro branded team soccer products and our new line of athletic game uniforms generated million of the increase 
we also benefited from increased focus on sales to youth leagues as well as increased volume and generally higher selling prices on our traditional team sports products 
revenues from school spirit lines products and services grew by or million  from million in to million in more than half of the revenue growth came from increased volume of uniforms and accessories 
camp and event revenues increased as well with the number of camp participants growing by  to  in after being relatively flat between and revenues from the retail segment were million in both and sales of sports collectible products increased while there was an offsetting decease in the volume of youth football equipment sold to retailers  as we shifted our youth emphasis to direct sales within our extracurricular segment 
royalty income from trademark licensing decreased by million to just over million in in comparison to trademark licensing royalties of million in the decline was anticipated due to the expiration of certain licenses in gross profit gross profit in increased to million from million in gross margins increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in gross margins in had been negatively impacted by million of charges relating to product line changes and other strategic decisions which affected the realizable value of inventories 
gross margins in were if adjusted to eliminate the impact of these charges 
the gross margin rate for the extracurricular segment increased to in from in gross margins in were if adjusted to eliminate the impact of the portion of the charges discussed above which related to the extracurricular segment 
margin rates improved in as a result of modest increases in selling prices  favorable negotiations with vendors and contractors  improved leverage due to higher absorption of the fixed portion of operating costs against higher revenue and certain other actions taken at the end of which reduced costs in gross margins for the retail segment increased to of revenues in from of revenues in gross margins in were if adjusted to eliminate the impact of the portion of the charges discussed above which related to the retail segment 
the increase in margins in was principally due to a shift in product mix as the decline in retail segment sales  as discussed above  occurred in product lines that carry below average margins in the segment 
many of the factors contributing to the margin improvement in the extracurricular segment also contributed to the margin improvement in the retail segment 
while trademark licensing does have some costs including selling  general and administrative expenses  there are no costs that are deducted in arriving at gross profit 
accordingly  any increase or decrease in royalty income results in a corresponding increase or decrease in gross profit for the licensing segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in increased by million from million in to million in this increase included million of commissions relating to higher sales and million of expense increases relating to our new line of umbro branded team soccer products leaving a net overall decrease of million in all other selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses in were impacted by million of charges relating to strategic changes  as discussed above  and would have been of revenues before consideration of this charge 
the improvement in the expense percentage in is principally due to the cost saving initiatives implemented at the end of and improved absorption of the relatively fixed portions of selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from the increase in revenues 
expenses in were negatively impacted by approximately million of expenses incurred in initial development costs relating to our internet operations 
extracurricular segment selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to of revenues in from in the improvement in the expense ratio was due to the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph 
expenses in included million of the charges relating to strategic changes  as discussed above 
retail segment selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to of revenues in from in the improvement in the expense ratio was due to the cost saving initiatives implemented at the end of  as well as planned reductions in product development costs 
licensing segment selling  general and administrative expenses were stable in comparison to the prior year  at approximately million in both and interest expense interest expense in increased  or million over levels due to an increase in average indebtedness 
debt levels were higher in due to higher indebtedness at the beginning of than at the beginning of and increased working capital demands related to our new line of umbro branded team soccer products and volume growth in other product lines 
income taxes income tax expense in reflects an adjustment relating to the valuation of deferred taxes and not a cash payment of taxes 
no tax expense  other than this adjustment  was recorded in  as we have net operating loss carry forwards which offset any such taxes  as described above 
umbro license in  we entered into a license agreement with umbro international  inc which entitles us to market and manufacture umbro brand soccer team apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories on an exclusive basis to the team channel of distribution throughout the united states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
the term of the license is five years with an option to renew for an additional five year period if we achieve certain performance levels 
the license was royalty free in we began paying royalties in the year  at which time we are also required to meet annual minimum sales figures 
if we fail to meet required minimum sales levels subsequent to for two consecutive annual periods  umbro has the right to terminate the license 
our subsidiary  varsity fashions and supplies  inc has recently filed a lawsuit in the southern district of new york against umbro and its related companies seeking to prevent certain breaches by umbro of its agreement with varsity pertaining to  inter alia  its sale of products into the united states via the internet and its threatened change of market positioning of certain umbro products previously sold by signal apparel  inc we do not believe the lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the company 
macgregor trademark we acquired certain rights to the macgregor trademark as part of an acquisition in at an allocated cost of approximately million 
we are amortizing the trademark over a period of forty years 
the unamortized cost of this asset included in intangible assets at december  was approximately million see note of the consolidated financial statements 
if there were a material decline in the revenues from the macgregor trademark  then the carrying amount of the macgregor trademark rights could be deemed to have been impaired 
a write down for such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of we formulated and initiated a restructuring plan involving the consolidation of several of our reconditioning facilities and the elimination of approximately jobs including two senior positions 
together these actions led to a  restructuring charge in the charge included a provision of  included in accrued liabilities at december   for certain lease termination and employee severance costs  most of which were expected to be expended during the restructuring actions are expected to yield annual savings of over million once facility closures are completed and new centralized operations are fully implemented 
the restructuring actions resulted in cost savings of approximately  in  net of non recurring current year expenses of  for restructuring related costs such as moving expenses 
restructuring savings realized during were approximately  it is estimated the remaining annual benefit will be realized during the initial restructuring plan called for essentially all of our restructuring activities to have been completed by the end of we completed and commenced operations of a new  larger reconditioning facility in however  the consolidation of reconditioning facilities originally scheduled for the fall of was delayed until the second quarter of the cessation of reconditioning operations at certain other facilities was delayed to allow additional time for the new reconditioning facility to reach full capacity 
as a result  while the anticipated senior positions were eliminated in  none of the employee severance costs related to the elimination of jobs at reconditioning facilities was expended until additionally  one of the leased reconditioning facilities originally slated for closure is now being utilized for the alternative purpose of warehousing finished goods 
the initial restructuring charge in included a provision of  included in accrued liabilities at december   for certain lease termination and employee severance costs 
in  approximately  of these costs were paid and  of lease termination costs were reversed to income when it was determined the facility would be used for alternate purposes  as discussed above  leaving a balance of  in accrued liabilities at december  in   of these costs were paid on completion of the plan and the unused remaining balance of  was reversed to income 
the unused balance principally related to severance costs that were not needed as the displaced employees were placed elsewhere in the company in positions that became open due to normal attrition and growth in other areas 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonality of our working capital needs is primarily impacted by three factors 
first  a significant portion of the products we sell into the extracurricular segment are sold throughout the year on dated payment terms  with the related receivables becoming due when the school year begins during the following july to october period 
second  we incur costs relating to our summer camp business during the first and second quarter as we prepare for the upcoming camp season  while camp revenues are mostly collected in the june to august period 
lastly  our debt structure impacts our working capital requirements as the semi annual interest payments on our million  senior notes come due each january and july 
to finance these seasonal working capital demands  we maintain a credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit 
the outstanding balance on the credit facility follows the seasonal cycles described above  increasing during the early part of the operating cycle in the first and second quarters of each year and then decreasing from the third quarter and into the fourth quarter as collections are used to reduce the outstanding balance 
at december  the outstanding balance under the credit facility was million 
this compares with outstanding balances of million at december  the increase in outstanding borrowings between december  and december  reflects the factors discussed above in the paragraph on interest expense in the comparison of results of operations between these periods 
our current debt service obligations are significant and  accordingly  our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend on our future performance and is subject to financial  economic and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
furthermore  due to the seasonality of working capital demands described above  year over year growth in our business and working capital could lead to higher debt levels in future periods 
we believe that operating cash flow together with funds available from our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current debt service  seasonal and other current working capital requirements
