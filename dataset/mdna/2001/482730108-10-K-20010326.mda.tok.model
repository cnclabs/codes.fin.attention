item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references to  and mean the fiscal years ended december   january  and january   respectively 
results of operations in  and  k tron reported net income of   and  respectively 
we are an international company  and we derived approximately  and of our  and revenues  respectively  from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities located outside the united states  primarily in europe 
accordingly  we are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange rates  which can affect both the translation of financial statement items into us dollars and the impact of transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different currencies  such as sales made from our swiss manufacturing facilities in currencies other than the swiss franc 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced that we would integrate our soder and hasler operations worldwide to form a unified business serving the bulk materials handling markets 
we took a fourth quarter charge of  for this restructuring 
implementation of the integration plan started in the fourth quarter of and was completed in october the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year total revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income interest income before income taxes year end backlog at year end foreign exchange rates  in thousands    as previously noted  more than half of our revenues in recent years have been derived from activities in foreign jurisdictions 
consequently  our results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates  particularly those between the us dollar and the swiss franc  german mark and euro and  to a lesser degree  the british pound sterling  french franc and other currencies 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales decreases 
when the non us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales increases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  since we typically receive a majority of our revenues in currencies other than the us dollar  we generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide  especially those identified above 
accordingly  changes in foreign exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our total revenues  gross profit and operating income as expressed in us dollars 
in addition  our revenues and income with respect to particular transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale  including in particular the us dollar swiss franc for inter company transactions and the euro swiss franc and german mark swiss franc for sales from our swiss manufacturing facilities which are made in euros or german marks exchange rates 
for  and  the changes in these and the us dollar euro and us dollar german mark exchange rates were as follows fiscal year average us dollar equivalent of one swiss franc change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one euro n a change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one german mark change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one german mark change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one euro n a change vs 
prior year total revenues decreased by  or in compared to north american revenues increased and western european revenues decreased in compared to if the average exchange translation rates for were applied to  revenues would have increased by in total revenues decreased by  or in compared to western european revenues increased and north american revenues decreased in compared to if the average foreign exchange translation rates for were applied to  revenues would have increased by in gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased to in as compared to in but decreased in both and as compared to in these changes in gross margin were primarily due to sales mix 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased by  or in compared to and by  or in compared to the decreases in and sg a were due to the lower foreign exchange translation rates of certain foreign currencies into us dollars lower foreign exchange translation rates offset in part by the restructuring costs of  relating to the hasler business 
as a percent of total revenues  sg a was in  in and in research and development r d expenditures in decreased by  or compared to after increasing by  or in compared to r d expense when expressed in local currencies increased in and due to greater emphasis on the development of new products 
r d expense as a percent of total revenues was in  in and in interest expense increased by  or in as compared to  primarily due to interest on funds borrowed in march related to the repurchase of  shares of our common stock  which is discussed below in the liquidity section  partly offset by the effects of lower foreign exchange translation rates 
interest expense decreased by  or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to weighted average lower debt levels and lower interest rates on some loans 
interest expense as a percent of total revenues was in  in and in income before income taxes was  in   in and  in the changes during the periods were the result of the items discussed above 
the  and provisions for income tax of   and  respectively  were related primarily to our results in the united states and germany 
the effective tax rates were for  for and for the higher effective tax rate in was due to a greater proportion of income in the united states as compared to switzerland where we did not provide for any income tax in  and due to net operating loss carryforwards 
we have new jersey state and foreign tax loss carryforwards that total  and  respectively  which  if realized  would have an estimated future net income benefit of  and  respectively 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations during the last three years 
our backlog increased by at the end of compared to at constant foreign exchange rates  primarily due to increased orders from customers in the united states 
the bulk of the year end backlog consisted of orders that should be ready for delivery in less than days 
our backlog decreased by at the end of compared to at constant foreign exchange rates  primarily due to the shipment of a large order in the fourth quarter of that was included in the year end backlog 
liquidity and capital resources on march   our us manufacturing subsidiary borrowed  under a term loan facility with a us bank  and we used these funds  together with  of available cash and a borrowing of  on a  revolving credit facility with the same bank  to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
the  term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over a four year period and is secured by liens on the same collateral which secures the revolving credit loan and also a separate mortgage loan from the same us bank 
one half of the term loan bears interest at the fixed rate of for the first two years and the other half is subject to a variable rate of interest equal to one month libor plus percent at december  
at december   there was  outstanding under the term loan 
at december   our swiss subsidiary had million swiss francs million in short term lines of credit with swiss banks  with nothing borrowed under these lines of credit and with million available for future borrowings 
in addition to the short term lines of credit  our swiss subsidiary had mortgage borrowings of million swiss francs million with maturities through these mortgages carry annual interest rates ranging from to 
in june  our us manufacturing subsidiary refinanced its year mortgage debt with a us bank for  at an annual interest rate of 
monthly principal and interest payments are  every five years the lender has the right to review this borrowing and adjust its terms  including due dates and interest rates  with the first such right occurring in june at december   the remaining amount owed under this borrowing was  also in june  our us manufacturing subsidiary entered into a two year secured revolving credit facility with a us bank that provides for a maximum borrowing of  subject to certain borrowing limitations based upon inventory and accounts receivable levels 
during  this credit facility was extended one year through july the annual interest rate as of december  was 
at december   there was  borrowed under this facility  and  was available for future borrowings

at the end of and  working capital was  and  respectively  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and  respectively 
in  and  we utilized internally generated funds to meet our working capital needs  and in we also used short term borrowings 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in   in and  in the increase in operating cash flow in was primarily the result of a reduction in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable offset by an increase in inventories 
the decrease in operating cash flow in was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable and inventory and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net income and depreciation and amortization were the principal components of cash provided by operating activities 
the average number of days to convert accounts receivable to cash was days in compared to days in and days in the average number of days to convert inventory into accounts receivable was days in compared to days in and net cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were   and  in  and  respectively 
funds used in to acquire an english company colormax limited were cash used in financing activities in  and was primarily used for the purchase of  shares of our common stock in   shares in and  shares in  as well as for debt reduction in in and  cash was obtained from operations as well as from long term borrowings in and short term borrowings in in  cash was primarily obtained from operations 
cash and short term investments decreased to  at the end of from  a year earlier 
changes in foreign exchange rates  particularly with respect to the swiss franc and german mark  caused a translation decrease in shareholders equity of  in and  in following an increase of  in european monetary union euro on january   the member countries of the european union  which does not include switzerland  established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges  but the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  non cash payments can be made in euros  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
we have not encountered significant difficulties with the adoption of the euro 
since our sales in europe have been from two manufacturing plants now one located in switzerland  and since some sales are made in swiss francs and others in local currencies  the relationship of the euro to the swiss franc is important to us  just as the relationship of the swiss franc and german mark has been important in the past 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
we regularly assess our pricing and marketing strategies in order to ensure that they remain competitive in the european market 
we have an information technology system in europe which allows for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and also for the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
based on current information and our current assessment  we do not believe that the euro conversion has had or will have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition
