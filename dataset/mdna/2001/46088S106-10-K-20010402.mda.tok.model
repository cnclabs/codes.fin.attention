bridgestreet provides corporate housing services in the united states  canada and the united kingdom

as of december   bridgestreet had approximately  apartments under lease in the united states  canada  and the united kingdom 
our financial statements include the operating results of bridgestreet since may  in late  amendments to the internal revenue code were enacted that permit real estate investment trusts to create a taxable subsidiary on or after january   which will be subject to taxation similar to a subchapter c corporation and which can perform some activities not permissible for the real estate investment trust 
as a result of this legislation  we agreed to assign all leases with meristar hospitality to taxable subsidiaries of meristar hospitality 
in connection with the assignment  we executed management agreements with the taxable subsidiaries for each of the properties 
we have structured the management agreements to substantially mirror the economics of the prior leases 
the conversion did not result in the exchange of any cash consideration among the parties 
under the management agreements  the annual base management fee is percent of total hotel revenue with increases up to percent of total hotel revenue based in part on our achievement of specified operating thresholds 
on february   we mailed a proxy to our shareholders seeking approval of a merger agreement providing for a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of american skiing company  a delaware corporation  with and into our company and the other transactions contemplated by that merger agreement 
on march   we and the other parties to the merger agreement mutually agreed to terminate the merger agreement

our assets include a substantial amount of intangible assets  primarily related to our acquisitions of hotel management companies and bridgestreet 
we evaluate the carrying values of our long lived intangible assets periodically in relation to the operating performance and expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets 
during  we conducted a review of each hotel s performance and anticipated future performance and our expected future income from those hotels 
we conducted this review in connection with the possible restructuring of our lease arrangements 
as a result of this review  our expectation for the future performance of some of our leased limited service hotels has been reduced 
this process triggered an impairment review of our long lived intangible assets  including goodwill 
the review included an analysis of our expected future undiscounted cash flows in comparison to the net book value of the long lived intangible assets 
this review indicated that certain long lived intangible assets  including goodwill  were impaired 
we estimated the fair value of the long lived intangible assets by using the discounted expected future cash flows generated by the underlying assets 
we reduced the net book value of those long lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value and recorded an impairment loss of million to adjust the goodwill related to our leased limited service hotels 
liabilities total liabilities increased by million to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the following o accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities increased million due to o higher operating expenses before participating lease expense and loss on asset impairment during the fourth quarter of as compared to  and o bridgestreet s accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  o amounts payable to meristar hospitality increased million primarily due to the participating rent payable balance at december  being higher than at december   and o long term debt increased million due to borrowings under our credit facility to fund short term liquidity requirements  the acquisition of bridgestreet and other investments

taxes decreased by million due to the operating loss in compared to the operating income compared to revenues our total revenue increased or to  million in compared to million in the increase in revenue is primarily the result of an increase in the number of hotels leased 
during the period january  through august   revenue represents capstar hotel company s management and leasing operations 
from august  through december  and for all of  revenue also includes the management and leasing operations of agh leasing  lp and american general hospitality  inc as a result  the revenue was derived from a smaller number of hotels being leased and managed throughout the year 
in addition  we had a significant increase in revenues from our resort properties due to the acquisition of south seas resorts 
we acquired this portfolio of resort properties during the fourth quarter of therefore  there are only three months of revenue included in and a full months of revenue included in from these properties 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million or to  million in compared to million in the increase reflects the increase in the number of leased and managed hotels 
this increase is consistent with the increase in revenues 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization increased to million in compared to million in the increase in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization is due to the change in the number of hotels operated and managed by us in compared to minority interest and taxes increased by million and million  respectively  due to higher operating income in compared to liquidity and capital resources sources of cash our continuing operations are funded through cash generated from hotel management and leasing operations  and corporate housing operations 
we finance business acquisitions and investments in affiliates through a combination of internally generated cash  external borrowings and the issuance of partnership interests and or common stock 
we generated million of cash from operations during we generated million of cash from financing activities during primarily from the following o we had net borrowings of million under our credit facilities  o we repaid million of the bridgestreet debt as part of our acquisition of bridgestreet  and o we received million from the issuances of our common stock

revolving credit facilities on august   we entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility with meristar hospitality 
this loan contains covenants regarding financial ratios  reporting requirements and other customary restrictions 
the interest rate on this loan is based on the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
as of march   we had million of borrowings outstanding at an interest rate of 
on february   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility among a syndicate of banks 
the credit facility bears interest at the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points and expires in february with an optional one year extension 
we borrowed million under the facility to repay the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement with meristar hospitality 
as of december   the senior secured revolving credit facility was fully drawn 
as of march   we had million of borrowings outstanding at an interest rate of 
upon execution of this new credit facility  the facility with meristar hospitality was amended to reduce the maximum borrowing limit from million to million 
at december   we were not in compliance with a debt covenant related to the senior secured facility 
on february   we obtained an amendment to the credit facility revising the covenant and waiving that failure to comply with the covenant 
we expect to meet the covenant at future determination dates 
summary we believe cash generated by our operations  together with anticipated borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service 
we expect to continue to seek acquisitions of hotel  resort and golf management businesses and management contracts 
in addition  we expect to expand our corporate housing business by entering new markets 
we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of additional borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of partnership interests and or our common stock 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in winter and early spring 
since the majority of our hotels are non resort properties  its operations generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
excluding the effect of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for contingent rent in interim financial periods  we have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
corporate housing activity peaks in the summer months and declines during the fourth quarter and the first part of the first quarter 
we expect to have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow from corporate housing in the first and fourth quarters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our credit facilities that impacts the fair value of these obligations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
in april  we entered into a million periodic rate collar agreement with a financial institution in order to hedge against the impact future interest rate fluctuations may have on our floating rate debt 
the rate collar agreement establishes the london interbank offered rate at a floor rate of and a ceiling rate of 
during the year ended december   we neither made nor received any payments related to this instrument 
the estimated fair value of the collar agreement is approximately  at december  our long term debt of million at december  matures in february with an optional one year extension 
interest on the debt is variable  based on the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
the interest rate was at december  we have determined that the fair value of the debt approximates its carrying value 
a change in the day london interbank offered rate would have changed our interest expense by approximately  during although we conduct business in canada and the united kingdom  these foreign operations were not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended december  additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we were not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
to date  we have not entered into any significant foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
