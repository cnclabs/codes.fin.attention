overview the company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
the company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products directly to builders and consumers and performs restoration services 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in the us and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction  cost management  fluctuations in european currencies primarily the euro and british pound  the increasing importance of home centers as distributors of home improvement and building products and the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition 
historically  the company has been able to largely offset cyclical declines in housing markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains 
corporate development mergers and acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to masco s long term growth  after the initial impact on earnings of transaction related costs and expenses such as interest and added depreciation and amortization 
the important earnings benefit to masco arises from subsequent growth of such companies  since incremental sales are not impacted by these expenses 
during  the company acquired masterchem industries  inc  a us manufacturer and supplier of paint primer and related products  tvilum scanbirk a s  a danish manufacturer of ready to assemble products including cabinetry  shelving  storage units and workstations  and several smaller companies

the aggregate net purchase price of these purchase acquisitions  excluding assumed debt of million  was million and included approximately million shares of company common stock valued at million including approximately four million shares issued in valued at approximately million 
the excess of the aggregate acquisition costs for these purchase acquisitions over the fair value of net assets acquired  totaling approximately  million  represents acquired goodwill  to be amortized over periods not exceeding years 
the results of operations for these purchase acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition 
had these companies been acquired effective january   pro forma unaudited consolidated net sales and net income would have approximated  million and million for and  million and million for  respectively  and pro forma unaudited consolidated diluted earnings per share would have increased by

certain purchase agreements of recent acquisitions provide for the payment of additional consideration  contingent upon certain conditions being met 
such additional consideration totaled million for the year ended december  and has been recorded as additional purchase price 
planned disposition of businesses in december  the company adopted a plan to dispose of several businesses which the company believes are not core to its long term growth strategies 
management has estimated the expected proceeds on these planned dispositions based on various analyses  including valuations by certain specialists 
for certain of these businesses  the expected proceeds are less than the related carrying value 
accordingly  a non cash  pre tax charge of million has been recorded with a write down of goodwill and long lived assets 
for those businesses where the expected proceeds are greater than the related carrying value  any gain will be recognized upon the completion of the transactions 
the company anticipates the planned dispositions to be substantially completed by the end of the sales and results of operations of these businesses will be included in continuing operations until disposed 
these businesses have combined annual sales of approximately million and an aggregate operating profit margin less than the company average
