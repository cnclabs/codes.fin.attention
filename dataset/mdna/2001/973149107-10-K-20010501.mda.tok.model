years ended january  and revenues revenues consist of product revenues and service revenues 
product revenues product revenues consist of royalties and fees for operating systems and fees for the use of development tools 
service revenues service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  customer training and consulting 
total revenues increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in revenues is due to increases in both product revenues and service revenues 
product revenues accounted for approximately and of the total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and service revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
product revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in product revenues was due primarily to the continued acceptance of wind river s products  increases in run time license revenues as customer developed products continue to be accepted by end users and to the expansion of wind river s product lines resulting from research and development and the integration of products from acquired companies 
product revenues are recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master in satisfaction of non cancelable contractual agreements provided that collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
service revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was due to growth in revenues from maintenance support agreements  both new and recurring  resulting from wind river s base of installed development environments and software applications provided to customers 
in addition  revenues from professional services increased due to continued strategic emphasis in this area 
deferred revenues result primarily from customer prepayments under software maintenance agreements  which are recognized ratably over the life of the agreements  certain run time agreements  which are recognized as target licenses are delivered and collection is reasonably assured  and professional services and engineering services contracts or training arrangements  which are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from international sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the percentage of wind river s total revenues from customers located internationally was in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the decrease in wind river s international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year is due primarily to domestic revenues increasing at a faster rate than international revenues and due to a decrease in revenues from japan as a result of the transition to a direct distribution model 
revenues from japan were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the percentage of revenues from other international regions remained relatively constant in fiscal years and at and of total revenues  respectively  while the percentage of revenues from customers located in japan decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal wind river expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenues  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
wind river s international sales are denominated in the local currencies 
wind river actively monitors its foreign currency exchange exposure  and to date such exposures have not had a material impact on wind river s results of operations or cash flows 
see item risk factors of this report 
cost of revenues the overall cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and fiscal cost of revenues comprises cost of products and cost of services 
cost of products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of products as a percentage of product revenues was and in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result  gross profit margins for products were and  respectively 
costs of products consist primarily of salaries and benefits for production employees  product media  and royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software and documentation and packaging 
the decrease in costs as a percentage of product revenues are due to production efficiencies achieved as more development  oem and run time licenses move through wind river s production cycle as well as a reduction in third party product costs 
wind river s cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues will be affected in the future by the distribution rights related to the introduction of new products and by royalty payments to third parties for sales related to their products which are integrated into wind river s technology and are sold as support tools 
amortization of capitalized software development costs included in cost of products for fiscal and  amounted to million for both years 
at january  and  wind river had net capitalized software costs of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  wind river capitalized an additional million in software development related costs 
additions in fiscal year will be amortized over eight quarters at  per quarter 
cost of services was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal service related cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenues was and respectively 
service related cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs associated with providing services to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization as well as costs to recruit  develop  and retain services professionals 
the increase in costs of service revenues is due to the company s investment in developing new services offerings and the addition of new personnel and certified third party contractors to wind river s professional services organization 
wind river expects the cost of service revenues will increase in absolute dollars as the company continues to increase its customer support staff  customer support capabilities and professional service organization 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal or of total revenues for both fiscal years 
the increase in absolute dollars from fiscal to resulted primarily from the growth of sales and marketing personnel both domestically and internationally  field engineers  expenses related to marketing and advertising programs and third party marketing costs for product introductions 
the increase was also due to costs associated with the integration of acquisitions made during the year 
such costs included redesign and reprinting of marketing material  sales meetings  trade show promotions and advertisements 
wind river expects its selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as it continues to increase its sales and marketing personnel and marketing and advertising programs 
product development and engineering expenses product development and engineering expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  product development and engineering expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in product development and engineering expenses is primarily due to the increase in staff and associated support for engineers to expand and enhance wind river s product line  including the costs associated with integrating engineering staff as a result of the business acquisitions which occurred during the fiscal year 
wind river believes that product development and engineering expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars both as a result of the investment in the internal development of new products and technologies and through acquisitions of companies and technologies 
in addition  wind river had million and  of funded research and development  which reduced its research and development expenses in fiscal years and  respectively  related to its center of excellence initiative 
the company expects the center of excellence program to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the next fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the growth in worldwide staff and infrastructure investments in the areas of information systems  finance  legal and administration to support the growth of wind river and to integrate the companies it has acquired 
in addition  fiscal included million in costs associated with the retirement costs of the former ceo  million in costs associated with the hiring of the current ceo and costs associated with the implementation of wind river s oracle software system which contributed to the higher cost as a percentage of revenues in that year 
wind river believes that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as it continues to invest in worldwide staff and infrastructure in the areas of information systems  finance and administration and consolidate the financial  manufacturing  customer relations management and customer support information systems of acquired companies 
wind river allocates the total costs for information technology and facilities to each of the functional areas that uses the information technology and facilities services based on their headcount 
information technology allocated costs include salaries  information technology  project costs  communication costs and depreciation expense for shared infrastructure costs 
facilities allocated costs include facility rent for the corporate offices as well as shared function offices  property taxes  depreciation expenses for office furniture and other department operating costs 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in amortization of intangibles is due to the amortization of identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to the purchase transactions completed this year  and primarily consists of amortization related to embedded support tools 
wind river expects to amortize  under current accounting rules  approximately million per quarter in identifiable intangibles and goodwill for the next thirteen quarters related to intangibles acquired in purchase transactions completed primarily during fiscal additional acquisitions could increase the amount of goodwill amortization 
acquisition related costs acquisition related costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million increase is primarily related to costs associated with the integration of integrated systems  and the write off of in process research and development costs from purchase transactions completed during the year 
during fiscal  wind river incurred million in acquisition and integration costs associated with the merger of integrated systems 
those costs included a million for investment banking fees  b million in severance costs  c million for office closure and other costs for surplus sales offices in the united states  europe and japan  d million for legal  accounting and other professional fees which relate primarily to the acquisition process for integrated systems and the elimination of acquired legal entities in the united states  europe and japan  and e  for general integration costs 
severance costs of million were paid during fiscal remaining severance costs are expected to be paid during fiscal a total of employees were terminated  including general and administrative employees  sales and marketing employees and employees from other areas 
employees were terminated if their roles or functions were duplicative following the merger with integrated systems 
the office closure costs relate to remaining lease payments on vacant offices extending to october  wind river recognized in process research and development charges of million during fiscal related to various purchase transactions completed during the year including amounts related to the acquisition of embedded support tools of million  rapid logic of million  audesi of million and icesoft of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
wind river also recognized an in process research and development charge of million relating to the operations of a subsidiary of integrated systems during fiscal the amounts related to in process technology represent purchased in process technology for projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
at the dates of acquisition  the average estimated percentage of completion was   and  for the in process research and development projects at embedded support tools  audesi  icesoft and rapid logic  respectively 
the expected completion dates for these projects were september  december  august and september  respectively 
the value of the in process research and development was determined by estimating the net cash flows resulting from the completion of the projects reduced by the percentage of completion of the projects 
net cash flows were offset using estimated income taxes consistent with wind river s anticipated tax rate for the foreseeable future and then discounted back to their present value at a discount rate based on wind river s required risk adjusted weighted average rate of return 
wind river s estimated revenues  margins and operating costs are based upon historical information about similar product development cycles combined with projections of future revenues and cost patterns  including projections used when initially evaluating the acquisitions 
wind river cannot guarantee that it will realize revenues from these in process projects in the amounts estimated or that the costs incurred will be materially consistent with estimates made 
however  to date  the company is not aware of any significant variations between costs incurred and estimates made 
the nature of the efforts to develop all purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the resulting products can meet their design specification  including function  features and technical performance requirements 
due to the fact that the projects were in process  there is uncertainty regarding whether they can be successfully finished and result in the net cash flows that were originally estimated at the time of the acquisitions 
it is reasonably possible that the development of the acquired technology could fail because of either prohibitive costs  wind river s inability to perform the required completion efforts or other factors outside wind river s control such as a change in the market for the resulting developed products 
if the development of the technology is unsuccessful  the technology may be abandoned during the development phase 
should wind river s development efforts fail or encounter significant delay  then wind river s future returns may be significantly reduced 
in such case  wind river may be unable to recover its investment in this project  may be less well positioned to benefit from new product markets in these areas and wind river s future operating results could be adversely affected 
the assumptions used in determining the value of in process research and development acquired in connection with wind river s purchase acquisitions completed during fiscal and have been consistent  in all material respects  with the actual results to date 
the assumptions primarily consist of the expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products during their entire life cycle will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and potentially result in impairment of any other assets related to the development activities 
other income and expense interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to higher interest earned on cash balances  short term investments and restricted cash balances 
total cash  investments and restricted cash at january  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
interest expense was million during fiscal and  respectively 
wind river pays interest on its outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in august of and maturities of certain issuance costs associated with these notes 
the interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year commencing february  other income and expense  net for fiscal was income of million compared to an expense of million in fiscal the increase in net other income was primarily due to gains of million related to the disposition of equity securities of liberate technologies  inc and e sim  inc wind river sold  common shares of liberate at prices ranging from to per share and  common shares of e sim at prices ranging from to per share during fiscal year during fiscal year  wind river recognized a charge totaling  relating to the difference between the carrying amount of its investment in xact  inc and management s assessment of the net realizable value of the investment 
provision for income taxes net income for fiscal was negatively impacted by million in acquisition related and other charges  including million  of in process research and development costs and million in amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
despite the occurrence of a net loss in fiscal  a tax provision resulted due to the exclusion of amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles  and the exclusion of in process research and development and other acquisition charges  which are non deductible for income tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal excluding amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles and acquisition charges was compared to for fiscal the change in the effective tax rate excluding amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles and acquisition charges is attributed to the change in the ratio of foreign taxable income to domestic taxable income and carryforward tax attributes 
years ended january  and revenues total revenues increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in revenues is due to increases in both wind river s product revenues and services revenues 
product revenues accounted for approximately and of the total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and service revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
product revenues increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase is due primarily to the continued acceptance of wind river s products such as the tornado ii integrated development environment and increased run time license revenues  as well as increased product lines resulting from research and development and integration of products acquired from integrated systems  xact and routerware 
service revenues increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance support agreements  both new and recurring resulting from wind river s base of installed development environments and software applications provided to customers 
the percentage of wind river s total revenues from customers located internationally was in fiscal years and the percentage of revenues from the europe and asia pacific regions remained relatively constant in fiscal years and at of total revenues 
wind river expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenues  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
wind river s international sales are denominated in the local currencies  and an increase in the relative value of the dollar against such currencies would reduce wind river s revenues in dollar terms or make wind river s products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in foreign markets 
wind river actively monitors its foreign currency exchange exposure  and to date such exposures have not had a material impact on wind river s results of operations 
the risks associated with international sales  are more fully discussed in the risk factors section contained in item of this report 
cost of revenues the overall cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and fiscal cost of revenues comprises cost of products and cost of services 
cost of products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal product related cost of revenues as a percentage of product revenues was and in fiscal years and  respectively

product development and engineering expenses product development and engineering expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  product development and engineering expenses were and  respectively  in fiscal and fiscal the increase in product development and engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increase in staff and associated support for engineers to expand and enhance wind river s product lines  including the costs associated with integrating engineering teams from xact  routerware and software development systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the growth in worldwide staff and infrastructure investments in the areas of information systems  finance and administration 
wind river s oracle financial and production computer systems became operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal year amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to integrated systems acquisition of software development systems in fiscal year amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets include the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets relating to various purchase acquisitions

interest expense was million during fiscal and wind river pays interest on its outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in august of and maturities of certain issuance costs associated with these notes 
the interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year commending february  other income and expense  net for fiscal was a net expense of million compared to million in fiscal the increase in net expense is primarily due to a charge during the first quarter of fiscal of  relating to the difference between the carrying amount of investment in xact and the net realizable value 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase is primarily due to non deductible acquisition costs related to software development systems 
excluding the impact of these costs  the effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year includes a million federal tax benefit related to a tax election at integrated systems 
excluding this tax benefit  the effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
variations in the effective tax rate result primarily from differences between foreign and domestic tax rates and the ratio of foreign taxable income to domestic taxable income and varying levels of research and development credits 
liquidity and capital resources at january   wind river had working capital of approximately million and cash and investments of approximately million  which include investments with maturities of greater than one year of million and excludes restricted cash of million 
wind river invests primarily in instruments that are highly liquid and of investment grade 
cash flows for the fiscal year ended include cash flows from companies acquired as purchase transactions from the date of their acquisition 
in fiscal  wind river s operating activities provided net cash of million compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of million was primarily due to net cash flows from operations of million before changes in assets and liabilities of million 
net cash flows from operations before changes in assets and liabilities consisted of the net loss of million and other items for million  which were offset by depreciation and amortization of million  a tax benefit of million and acquired in process research and development of million 
net changes in assets and liabilities consisted primarily of the increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased sales activity  and an increase in other assets and liabilities of million  which were offset by increases in accrued compensation  deferred revenues  accrued liabilities and accounts payable which totaled million 
in fiscal  wind river s investing activities used net cash of million compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal uses of cash relating to the purchase of available for sale investments  business acquisitions and the purchase of equipment  were partially offset by cash provided from the sale of available for sale investments 
as wind river transitioned its investment portfolio from long term to short term investments its short term investments increased by million 
restricted cash increased due to the new collateral funding for the second corporate facility operating lease 
the collateral consists of direct obligations of the united states government  with the majority being long term investments 
in fiscal  wind river s financing activities provided net cash of million compared to million in fiscal  and a usage of cash of million in fiscal during fiscal  cash provided by the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and the increase in a line of credit at the wind river s japanese subsidiary were partially offset by the repayment of bank borrowings associated with acquired companies 
during fiscal  both wind river and integrated systems repurchased common stock for amounts totaling approximately million through existing stock repurchase programs 
in june  the board of directors rescinded all stock repurchase authorizations 
wind river has not made any repurchases since march  on september   its ceo signed a secured promissory note with the company to borrow up to million 
as of january   the ceo had borrowed million against this note 
in july  wind river issued million of convertible subordinated notes  which mature on august  the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and are convertible into shares of wind river s common stock at a price of per share 
the notes are redeemable at the option of wind river  in whole or in part  at any time on or after august  at of the principal amount initially  and thereafter at prices declining to at maturity  in each case plus accrued interest 
each holder of these notes has the right  subject to certain conditions and restrictions  to require wind river to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes  in whole or in part  owned by such holder  at specified repurchase prices plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of certain events 
the million of costs incurred in connection with the offering are included in prepaid and other assets 
these costs are being amortized to interest expense over the year term of the notes using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
interest on the notes began accruing july  and is payable semi annually on february and august  commencing on february  we do not know at this time whether we will be able to refinance the notes on favorable terms or at all 
see item risk factors in this report 
in fiscal year and fiscal year  wind river entered into operating leases for its headquarters facility constructed on land owned by wind river 
construction of the latest set of buildings was completed in january the lessor has funded a total of million of construction costs related to the first set of buildings and operating lease and has funded a total of million of construction costs related to the second set of buildings and second operating lease 
the operating lease payments will vary based upon the total construction costs of the buildings  which include capitalized interest and the london interbank offering rate libor 
in connection with the lease of wind river s headquarters  wind river has entered into a ground lease of its land in alameda  california  with the lessor of the building at a nominal rate and for a term of years 
if wind river terminates or does not negotiate an extension of the building lease  the ground lease converts to a market rental rate 
the ground lease provides wind river with the option at the end of the lease terms to either acquire the buildings at the lessor s original cost or arrange for the buildings to be acquired 
wind river has guaranteed the residual value associated with the buildings under the first operating lease and second operating lease to the lessor of approximately and  respectively  of the lessor s actual funding of the two leases 
wind river is also required to deposit fixed income securities with a custodian as a deposit to secure the performance of its obligations under the lease 
in addition  under the terms of the lease  wind river must maintain compliance with certain financial covenants 
as of january   wind river was in compliance with these covenants 
management believes that the contingent liability relating to the residual value guarantee will not have a material adverse effect on wind river s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
on march   wind river entered into an accreting interest rate swap agreement to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate operating lease for its new corporate headquarters 
the swap agreement effectively changes wind river s interest rate exposure on its operating lease  which is based on the one month libor  to a fixed rate of 
at january   the notional amount of the accreting interest rate swap was million 
on january   wind river entered into another interest rate swap agreement to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its second floating rate operating lease for the additional construction of its headquarters facility 
this second swap agreement changes wind river s interest rate exposure on its second operating lease  which is based on the one month libor  to a fixed rate of 
at january   the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million 
the differential to be paid or received under both swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to rent expense related to the respective operating leases 
the swap agreements mature at the same time as their respective operating lease expires 
the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the term of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations exceed the obligations of wind river 
wind river is required to adopt sfas and sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  and believes it will not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
wind river has an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
wind river attempts to limit this exposure by investing in high grade fixed income securities 
management believes that wind river s working capital and cash flow generated from operations are sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for planned expansion  product development and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and on a longer term basis  however  wind river may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance its liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to wind river s stockholders 
euro currency on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
since that date  the euro has traded on currency exchanges 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january and january  during the transition period  non cash payments can be made in euros  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and february   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies from circulation 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
wind river is assessing its pricing and marketing strategy in order to insure that it remains competitive in a broader european market and is reviewing whether certain existing contracts will need to be modified 
wind river has assessed the ability of information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies and believes that its information technology systems will not be affected by the transition to the euro 
wind river does not presently expect that introduction and use of the euro will materially affect wind river s foreign exchange exposures and hedging activities or will result in any material increase in costs to wind river 
wind river s currency risk and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
final accounting  tax and governmental  legal and regulatory guidance is not available 
wind river will continue to evaluate issues involving introduction of the euro 
based on current information and wind river s current assessment  the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those derivatives would be accounted for in current earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
wind river must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of qualifying hedging transactions 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
sfas deferred the effective date of sfas until the first fiscal year beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas sfas amends sfas to permit limited use of central treasury offsetting of net exposures of inter company derivatives for foreign currency cash flow hedges 
the adoption of these standards in the first quarter of fiscal had no material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb this interpretation clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  wind river has adopted the provisions of fin  which has not had a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity wind river s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
wind river places its investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  wind river s first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  wind river seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
wind river mitigates default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that it believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
wind river believes an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting wind river s floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of january  would have an immaterial effect on wind river s pretax earnings 
wind river also believes the immediate basis point move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of wind river s fixed income securities 
in march  wind river entered into a accreting interest rate swap to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating interest rate operating lease for its new headquarters 
at january   the notional amount of the accreting interest rate swap was million 
the estimated fair value at january  was negligible 
in january  wind river entered into a interest rate swap to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on its second floating interest rate operating lease for the additional construction of its headquarters facility 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million 
the estimated fair value at january  was negligible 
foreign currency risk wind river transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in japanese yen and certain european currencies 
wind river has established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency exchange contracts for its foreign currency transaction exposures in japan and certain european countries 
under this program  increases or decreases in wind river s foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
wind river does not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding forward contracts at the end of a period are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in other income  net  and thus are recognized in income in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows 
as these forward contracts mature the realized gains and losses are recorded and are included in net income as a component of other income  net 
wind river s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature
