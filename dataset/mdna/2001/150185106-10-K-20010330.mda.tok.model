in  attendance increases at cedar point and valleyfair nearly offset the attendance decline at dorney park caused be very poor weather throughout much of the season  and combined attendance at the five amusement parks finished the year at million  almost even with meanwhile  combined attendance at the partnership s four water parks nearly doubled to million  with the two new california water parks accounting for the increase 
in  knott s berry farm and dorney park both had record years  which nearly offset attendance declines at cedar point  valleyfair and worlds of fun caused by the lack of major new rides and less than ideal weather conditions 
in  knott s berry farm s full year contribution accounted for most of the increase in combined attendance and revenues 
meanwhile  attendance at the partnership s original four parks was up over  due to the successful debuts of the power tower thrill ride at cedar point and the mamba roller coaster at worlds of fun  as well as improved weather at cedar point throughout the season 
in addition  dorney park continued to perform strongly in and achieved its second straight record year 
combined guest per capita spending increased in and in costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization in increased to million from million in and million in  largely due to the inclusion of the daily operations of the breakers express hotel and the two california water parks in and the buena park hotel s operations beginning in included in current year costs and expenses are approximately million of non recurring charges incurred in eliminating the partnership s previous general partner fee and executive compensation systems  while million and million of fees were earned by the general partner under the previous system in and  respectively 
operating income in decreased to million  following a increase in and a increase in operating results in the current year were significantly impacted by the million of non recurring costs 
excluding this one time charge  operating income increased as the result of increases in guest per capita spending at each of the parks and additional revenues generated by the two new water parks and the new hotel at cedar point

net income for  after the million  or 
per unit  special charge  decreased to million compared to million in and million in in  interest expense rose due to rising interest rates  as well as increased borrowings from the acquisitions of a hotel and water park in california  large unit repurchases under the buy back program  and significant capital expenditures at several of the parks for the season 
for  the partnership plans to invest million in capital improvements at its nine properties  including the construction of talon  a world class suspended coaster  at dorney park  an upscale camping complex  called lighthouse point  at cedar point  and the addition of camp snoopy and the peanuts characters at worlds of fun 
we are optimistic that these investments  as well as other improvements at each of the parks  will generate a high level of public interest and acceptance 
however  stable population trends in our market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance at our parks 
historically  the partnership has been able to improve its profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in its parks and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain consistently high attendance levels as well as steady increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
in  million variable price unit options were issued to the partnership s senior management  which will require recognition in future periods of charges for non cash compensation expense to the extent the exercise price of the options falls below the market price of our limited partnership units 
partnership financial condition the partnership ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio of at december  is the result of the partnership s highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities and pre opening expenses as required 
in  cash generated from operations totaled million and new term loan borrowings totaled million 
the partnership used million for capital expenditures  million for distributions to the general and limited partners  million to repurchase limited partnership units on the open market and million to reduce the general partner s interest in the partnership 
distributions in  at the current annual rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in the partnership has available through april a million revolving credit facility  of which the full million was borrowed as of december  an additional million revolving credit facility is available through november to fund peak seasonal requirements  of which million was borrowed as of december  credit facilities and cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet seasonal working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions
