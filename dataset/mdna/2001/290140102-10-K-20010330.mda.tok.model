overview we incorporated in delaware in march in february  we launched version of our solutions platform  which included the essential elements of content production and navigation  including synchronized video  audio  graphics and text as well as searchable transcripts  for delivery on cd rom only 
in july  we launched version  which expanded delivery from cd rom to intranets  included searchable slides and added variable speed playback 
in november we launched version it further expanded delivery options to include web based transmissions at kbps and added tracking and reporting and software demonstrations 
in april  we introduced our content hosting service and software 
in january  we launched our professional services organization to provide integration services and professional media development services 
in april  we launched version of our solutions platform  which added support for high resolution video and the ability for application developers to customize certain aspects of our software 
in december  we launched version  which offers advanced integration  search  navigation and analysis features 
in august  we launched version  which allows enterprises to organize  manage  secure  personalize and enrich all forms of streaming content 
we generate revenue through content production services  software licenses and maintenance and professional services 
for each content production transaction  we charge our customers a fixed fee for each hour of finished content 
our software license revenue consists of one time fees charged for the use of our desktop player and applications server software and monthly fees for content hosting 
our maintenance revenue consists of prepaid contracts related to software  which are recognized over the contract term  usually one year 
our professional services revenue is from contracted services to customize the content and software for our customers 
most of our revenue to date has been from our content production services 
we expect content production services to produce the largest portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future  but we intend to increase sales of our applications server software and content hosting so that software license revenue constitutes an increasing percentage of our revenue 
the gross margin attributable to software license revenue is significantly higher than that of our content production services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase the proportion of software license revenue and  therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to proportionally improve our gross margin 
we generally recognize content production services revenue upon shipment of the rich media event to the customer and software license revenue upon delivery of software to the customer 
content production services revenue includes revenue for cd rom duplication 
we recognize this revenue upon shipment of the duplicated cd roms 
the revenue for software licenses is recognized upon shipment  or upon notification by the customer  dependent on the delivery medium 
we recognize revenue for maintenance and content hosting ratably over the period of the maintenance or content hosting contract 
we recognize professional services revenue on a percentage of completion basis as services are performed 
a limited number of large customers have accounted for a majority of our revenue  and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in the year ended december  to date  most of our customers have been in the telecommunications  software  high technology manufacturing  financial services and pharmaceuticals industries 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis to date and we may continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in december  we announced a plan to restructure operations and gave notice of termination to employees and consultants 
the restructuring is intended to better align eloquent with future market opportunities brought about by its new product introductions and to reduce cash expenditures prior to revenue growth 
we expect to increase our operating expenses commensurate with increases in revenue 
if we are not able to increase revenue  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business 
due to the marketing cycles of our customers  sales of our content production services generally tend to be lower in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
because the market for rich media business to business communications using the web is still new  additional seasonal and other patterns in the usage of our products and services may emerge as the market matures

software licenses and maintenance 
revenue from software licenses and maintenance were million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to higher quantity sales of our server product  enterprise communications server ecs

content production services 
content production services revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
although we produced approximately rich media events in  a increase over  lower pricing contributed to the decrease in revenue from to over of the increase from to was attributable to an increase in the number of rich media events we produced  from events in to events in the remainder was primarily attributable to increased prices in professional services

approximately of the increase from to reflects increases in customer service personnel and content hosting activities to support software licenses and maintenance  and the remainder reflects higher royalty payments associated with increased software revenue 
content production services 
cost of content production was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in expense from to both in dollars and as a percentage of content production revenue  primarily reflects increased costs associated with additional production personnel and related facilities and infrastructure costs 
the decrease from to was primarily due to a reduced fixed and variable cost structure in  which we achieved in early through a restructuring of our production facility and processes 
the restructuring included the termination of eight full time content production employees  six of whom previously had been classified as production overhead 
we also undertook to more closely manage the correlation of our direct labor force with content production volume  resulting in reduced utilization of approximately temporary direct labor employees 
several efficiency measures were also introduced  including initiating content production on an event only basis only after all customer materials are received  parallel processing paths for certain production activities  electronic exchange with customers for revisions of certain event elements  greater workflow and document integration with our automated event management system to minimize paper documents  and earlier production involvement in the post sales process to clearly delineate customer requirements 
these restructuring initiatives yielded higher production efficiency  including faster content production times and higher production capacity 
although we continued our efforts in to manage the correlation of our direct labor force with content production volume  expense levels for personnel and infrastructure are committed in advance of customer orders 
the decrease in content production revenue to million in from million in resulted in excess committed production costs that could not be immediately eliminated 
professional services 
the professional services department was established in mid february cost of professional services was million in compared to million in the increase in expenses is due to higher personnel and recruiting costs associated with the growth of our professional services offerings 
operating expenses

other sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses associated with the sale of our products and services and personnel and marketing materials and expenses associated with the marketing of our products and services 
other sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases were due primarily to higher personnel expenses and recruiting costs associated with growth in our sales force and marketing staff

approximately of the increase in general and administrative expenses from to reflects higher personnel expenses 
approximately of the increase relates to our allowance for identified doubtful accounts  and of the increase reflects additional professional fees necessary to support our growth 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be the same or decrease in the near future 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense consist primarily of charges related to the difference between employee option exercise prices and deemed fair market values on the date of grant amortized over the vesting period of the options 
stock based compensation expense was million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in expense from to was due to the reversal of amortized stock based compensation expense related to cancellations  due to employee terminations during  of unvested stock options previously granted 
the increase in expense from to was due to increased grants of stock options and increases in the deemed fair market value of the underlying stock 
stock based compensation charges are presented within the relevant functional expenses and are being amortized using an accelerated method of amortization as described in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 over the vesting periods of the options  generally four to five years 
restructuring expense and impairment of property and equipment 
in december  eloquent announced a plan to restructure operations that resulted in a one time charge totaling million 
the restructuring is intended to better align eloquent with future market opportunities brought about by its new product introductions and to reduce cash expenditures prior to revenue growth 
under the plan  eloquent gave notice of termination in december to employees and consultants and recorded approximately million related to salary and termination benefits 
eloquent plans to reduce expenditures for office space and is actively negotiating lease terminations  where feasible  and pursuing sub leases where lease termination is not feasible for identified properties 
the restructuring charge includes million for lease expense 
this charge reflects payments required during lease termination notice periods  estimates of lease payments prior to sub letting space and estimates of any rent differential between the contractual liability of eloquent and current market rates 
the restructuring charge includes  for the buy out of capital leases related to impaired equipment and elimination of maintenance contracts for impaired software 
in addition  eloquent recorded a million non cash impairment charge to write off the carrying value of excess equipment and furniture  abandoned leasehold improvements and certain software and technology assets 
the excess equipment and furniture and abandoned leasehold improvements are a result of the termination of employees and consolidation of the remaining employees in fewer leased facilities 
at december  eloquent had made payments of  related to salary and termination benefits   related to lease arrangements and had a remaining accrual balance of million 
operating expenses and cost of revenue  excluding stock based compensation expense  restructuring expense and impairment charges in the first quarter of are expected to decrease from those incurred in the last quarter of by approximately  corresponding to the restructuring

in  interest expense and other charges consisted primarily of interest charges on equipment leases and bank lines of credit 
interest expense and other charges were million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in expense from to primarily reflects repayment of the subordinated notes and the bank line of credit in february upon the consummation of our initial public offering 
approximately of the increase in expense from to reflects interest costs associated with the million subordinated notes 
the remaining increase reflects higher average borrowing balances 
impairment on investment 
in march  eloquent and espoc inc espoc  a provider of an electronic marketplace for the purchase and liquidation of medical equipment and supplies  entered into a strategic relationship 
as part of this relationship  eloquent purchased  shares of espoc preferred stock for million 
this investment is being accounted for using the cost method 
during the fourth quarter of  eloquent performed an evaluation of the carrying value of this investment 
eloquent considered current financial market conditions for raising capital and reviewed the cash flows and operating results of the entity 
eloquent concluded that the unfavorable financial market conditions as they relate to entities engaged in electronic commerce are not temporary 
accordingly  the carrying value of the equity investment in espoc inc was determined to be impaired 
a loss of million was recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value of eloquent s proportionate share of the net assets of espoc 
interest income and other income 
interest income and other income consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income and other income was million   and  in  and  respectively 
the increases were due to increasing average cash balances 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt and cumulative effect of accounting change 
in october  eloquent sold convertible subordinated notes and detachable warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for aggregate gross consideration of million 
in conjunction with the sale of the notes eloquent incurred million in debt issue costs 
the gross consideration received from the notes was allocated between the notes and the warrants in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants as follows long term notes payable of million and warrants of million 
the notes contained a beneficial conversion feature of million which was recorded as a further discount on the sale of the notes 
the debt issuance costs and the discount resulting from the issuance of the warrants and the original beneficial conversion feature were being amortized to interest expense 
in accordance with the terms of the notes  all amounts outstanding under the notes were repaid upon consummation of eloquent s initial public offering on february  upon repayment of the notes  the unamortized portion of the debt issuance costs and the discount were recorded as an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt 
during the fourth quarter of we also recorded an additional charge of million relating to a convertible debt instrument as a cumulative effect adjustment to account for a change in accounting guidance 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through private sales of preferred stock  our initial public offering of common stock and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under lines of credit 
net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock were approximately million 
at december   we had approximately million of cash equivalents and short term investments 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a net loss which was partially off set by non cash charges related to the loss on early extinguishment of debt  the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the beneficial conversion feature of the subordinated notes  impairment of investment  depreciation and amortization of tangible assets and stock based compensation expense 
net cash used in operating activities in and was primarily attributable to net losses 
net cash used in investing activities was million  and  in  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in was related primarily to investments in short term marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities in and was primarily related to purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  partially offset by repayment of borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the sale of preferred stock and subordinated notes and warrants 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from borrowings under our lines of credit 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may need to raise additional funds thereafter through public or private financings  or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional financings  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  if at all 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current  stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
defers the application of sfas no 
to be effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   however  early application is encouraged 
eloquent will adopt sfas no

the adoption has not had a material affect on the financial statement presentation 
risks and uncertainties in addition to the other information provided in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating eloquent and our business 
risks related to our business because we have a limited operating history  it may be difficult for you to evaluate our business and prospects 
eloquent was formed in march thus  we have a limited operating history  which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business 
in part because we are subject to the risks  expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving technology and web related markets  we cannot be sure that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we seek 
moreover  because these markets are constantly changing  we may need to change our business model to adapt 
we have not yet proven our ability  on a sustained basis  to achieve the following maintain and expand our customer base  identify new applications for our existing products  expand and enhance our customer solutions  maintain market prices for our solutions despite competition  effectively integrate any acquired businesses or technologies with our operations  prevent technologies we use in our operations from failing or operating poorly  and identify  attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may not be successful in achieving these objectives on a long term basis 
if we are unable to do so  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
we expect to continue to incur losses  and as a result we may not achieve profitability 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis to date and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
our failure to achieve profitability could deplete our current capital resources and reduce our ability to raise additional capital 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in compared to million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in december  eloquent announced a plan to restructure operations 
the plan is intended to better align eloquent with future market opportunities brought about by its new product introductions and to reduce cash expenditures prior to revenue growth 
under the plan  eloquent gave notice of termination in december to over employees and consultants 
this resulted in excess equipment and furniture and unused leased facilities 
accordingly  eloquent plans to reduce expenditures for office space and has written off the carrying value of excess equipment and furniture  abandoned leasehold improvements and certain software and technology assets 
although we have initiated actions to reduce cash expenditures and expenses  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating additional revenue or achieving profitability 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations  and an unanticipated decline in revenue may cause our stock price to fall 
in some future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which would cause the price of our common stock to fall 
the factors that may cause our quarterly operating results to fall short of expectations include delays of large customer orders  which could prevent us from recognizing revenue until later quarters  seasonal trends in sales of our solutions  which could result in lower quarterly revenue particularly in the fourth quarter  downward pressure on prices paid by our customers  as a result of competition or other factors  which could reduce our quarterly revenue even if we maintain or increase the number of sales  new product and service introductions by our competitors  which could cause our competitors to capture revenue that we otherwise could have received  increased costs incurred as we expand operations  increase our marketing efforts or undertake other initiatives  which could reduce our profit margin if not matched by a corresponding growth in revenue  and technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the web generally or the operation of our network or servers  which could cause customer dissatisfaction and reduce our revenue 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business 
due to the marketing cycles of our customers  sales of our content production services generally tend to be lower in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
because the market for rich media business to business communications using the web is still new  additional seasonal and other patterns in the usage of our products and services may emerge as the market matures 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future because of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
as a result  operating results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of future operating results 
we depend on a limited number of large customers for a majority of our revenue  so the loss of or delay in payment from one or a small number of customers could have a large impact on our revenue and operating results 
if we were to lose a key customer  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
in addition  if a key customer fails to pay amounts it owes us  or does not pay those amounts on time  our revenue and operating results would suffer 
a limited number of large customers have accounted for a majority of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
for example  our top customers during accounted for over of our revenue during that period 
due to our limited number of large customers  the cancellation or delay of a customer order during a given quarter is likely to significantly reduce revenue for the quarter 
the length of our sales cycle is uncertain and therefore could cause significant variations in our operating result 
because our customers are typically large corporations  the length of our sales cycle the time between an initial customer contact and completing a sale can be unpredictable 
the time between the date of our initial contact with a potential new customer and the execution of a sales contract with that customer ranges from less than two weeks to more than three months  depending on the size of the customer  the application of our solution and other factors 
our sales cycle is also subject to delays as a result of customer specific factors over which we have little or no control  including budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures 
during the sales cycle  we may expend substantial sales and management resources without generating corresponding revenue 
our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in part on our expectations of our future revenue 
as a result  any delay in our sales cycle could cause significant variations in our operating results  particularly because a relatively small number of customer orders represents a large portion of our revenue 
we may not be able to build an effective sales organization  which would prevent us from achieving the increased sales volume necessary for us to achieve profitability 
in order to increase our revenue  we must build an effective sales organization 
if we do not do so  we will not be able to increase our sales sufficiently to achieve profitability 
in connection with our recent restructuring  we reduced the size of our sales organization 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain additional  qualified sales personnel and to train and motivate such personnel 
in the past  we have had difficulty recruiting  retaining and managing qualified sales personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will not encounter similar difficulties in the future 
competition for personnel  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where we are located  is intense 
many of the companies that will be competing with us for qualified sales personnel are larger and more established than we are and have greater financial resources than we do 
this may make it even more difficult for us to recruit and retain such personnel 
our operational history suggests that the level of sales we achieve is generally determined by the number of qualified sales personnel we employ 
in and early  we suffered a significant decline in sales to customers in the western united states primarily due to attrition in our experienced west coast sales force 
if we experience turnover in our sales force in the future  our business  financial condition and operating results will suffer 
newly hired sales personnel generally do not become fully productive until they have worked for at least two quarters 
because of the time required to recruit new sales personnel and for them to become fully productive  an unanticipated loss of sales personnel could result in an under productive sales organization and reduced sales for a significant period of time 
we face intense competition for personnel  which could impair our ability to recruit and retain key personnel 
our ability to develop  market and sell our solutions and to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  sales and marketing and other personnel 
there is a limited number of people with the necessary technical skills and understanding  and competition for their services  particularly in the san francisco bay area  is intense 
if we fail to recruit or retain these personnel  our ability to develop  market and sell our solutions will suffer 
we depend on technology licensed from other companies 
we may not be able to renew these licenses as they expire from time to time  and we may not be able to replace the licensed technology without significant expense or engineering efforts  if at all 
our desktop player software  which runs on an end user s personal computer to allow the user to view an event  and our enterprise communications server product  which enables customers to deliver events to their target audiences through web based channels  include technologies that other companies have licensed to us 
if we are unable to maintain or renew these licenses when they expire  we would be forced to remove these technologies from our products and develop or license comparable technologies 
this could require additional license fees or extensive engineering efforts  or significantly decrease our products functionality  either of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we have developed our products to integrate well with the microsoft windows nt operating system  the operating system used by most of our customers to run our software 
if the windows nt operating system is changed by microsoft so that it no longer integrates well with our products  or if windows nt experiences technical problems  the operation of our software could be impaired 
in that event  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
microsoft is not obligated to ensure that windows nt integrates well with our products 
we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties to refine  develop  market and deliver new products 
we may be unable to obtain any needed license on commercially reasonable terms or at all and rights granted under any licenses may not be valid and enforceable 
we operate in markets that will become increasingly competitive  which could lead to decreasing prices and reduced profitability 
the market for rich media business to business communications solutions is new and rapidly evolving 
we expect that competition will intensify 
increased competition could lead to decreasing prices and profitability 
we compete with companies that offer components of a rich media business to business communications solution  including providers of rich media software tools  multimedia content production and delivery companies  companies that provide content hosting services  which include storing  delivering and tracking the distribution of content  and traditional business to business communications and learning solution companies that offer live meeting and seminar services 
in addition  our customers and potential customers represent a source of competition to the extent they decide to develop in house business to business communications solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger existing customer bases than we do 
these competitors may also be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees and partners 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors  and competitive pressures may cause our business to suffer 
our management team has little experience working together in their current positions  which could limit the team s effectiveness in operating our business 
our management team does not have significant experience working together at eloquent in their current positions 
this could prevent or limit our management team s ability to work together effectively 
the failure of our management team to work together effectively could delay efficient decision making and execution of business objectives  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to adequately manage our anticipated growth  which could impair our efficiency and negatively impact our operations 
we may not be able to manage our growth effectively  which could impair our efficiency  reduce the quality of our solutions  impair further growth and harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we do not effectively manage this growth  we will not be able to operate efficiently or maintain the quality of our products 
either outcome would harm our operating results 
in the past  we have experienced rapid growth  and we plan to continue to expand our operations 
this expansion is expensive and places a significant strain on our personnel and other resources 
to manage our expanded operations effectively  we will need to further improve our operational  financial and management systems and successfully hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
we plan to expand our business into international markets  in which we have no prior experience 
international expansion will require significant resources and will subject us to new risks that may limit our return from our international sales efforts 
one of our strategies to increase our sales sufficiently to achieve profitability is to add an international sales force and operations 
this expansion will involve a significant use of management and financial resources  particularly because we have no previous experience with international operations 
we may not be successful in creating international operations or sales 
in addition  international business activities are subject to a variety of risks  including the adoption of laws  currency fluctuations  actions by third parties and political and economic conditions  any of which could restrict or eliminate our ability to do business in foreign jurisdictions 
we will depend on revenue from our content hosting business  which will suffer if our hosting equipment and software experience system failures 
our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully host our customers content on our servers 
our ability to host content will depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems 
we do not have fully redundant content hosting systems  a formal disaster recovery plan or alternative providers of hosting services 
we also may not have business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 
all of our content hosting servers are located at xo communications  inc s xo facilities in cupertino  california 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures or similar events 
they are also subject to computer viruses  break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the xo s facility could result in interruptions in our content hosting service 
in addition  the failure by xo to provide the data communications capacity that we require could result in interruptions in our content hosting service 
any damage to or failure of our content hosting systems could result in interruptions in our content hosting service 
system interruptions will reduce our revenue and profits  and our future revenue and profits will be harmed if our customers believe that our content hosting system is unreliable 
potential errors in our software could harm our reputation and reduce our sales and profitability 
software defects discovered after we release our software could result in the loss of revenue  delays in market acceptance and harm to our reputation 
any product liability claim against us  if successful and of sufficient magnitude  could harm our profitability and future sales 
our software has in the past contained  and may in the future contain  bugs or errors 
although we typically design our customer license agreements to contain provisions that limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  we cannot guarantee that contractual limitations of liability would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages to a customer resulting from a defect in our software 
even though we maintain insurance that covers damages arising from the implementation and use of our software  we cannot assure you that our insurance would cover or be sufficient to cover any product liability claims against us 
we have in the past experienced returns of our products  and as our business grows we may experience increased returns  which could harm our reputation and negatively impact our operating results 
in the past  some of our customers have returned our rich media events to us because they felt that modifications were required for the product to meet project specifications and the customer s requirements 
it is likely that we will experience some level of returns in the future and  as our business grows  the amount of returns may increase despite our efforts to minimize returns 
also  returns may adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and may harm our reputation 
this could cause us to lose potential customers and business in the future 
power outages in california may adversely affect us 
we conduct most of our operations in the state of california and rely on a continuous power supply to conduct operations 
california s current energy crisis could substantially disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california has recently implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
although state lawmakers are working to minimize the impact  if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we may be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could delay the development and production of our products and disrupt communications with our customers or suppliers 
future interruptions could damage our reputation and could result in lost revenue  either of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  shortages in wholesale electricity supplies have caused power prices to increase 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase which will have a negative effect on our operating results 
the failure to protect our intellectual property may impair our competitive position 
our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  proprietary technology and similar intellectual property are critical to our success 
if we are unable to adequately protect our rights from infringement by competitors or others  or from misuse by our licensees  the competitive advantage that our rights provide will be weakened 
we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and independent contractors to protect our proprietary rights 
we strategically pursue the registration of trademarks and service marks in the united states and abroad 
effective trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights to third parties 
the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
although we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by these licensees  licensees may take actions that may harm the value of our proprietary rights or reputation 
we may become subject to intellectual property litigation in the future that could cause us to incur significant expense and could require us to alter our products 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims associated with our intellectual property from time to time in the future 
these claims  even if without merit  could cause us to expend significant financial and managerial resources 
further  if these claims are successful  we may be required to change our trademarks  alter our copyrighted material or pay financial damages  any of which could harm our business 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks or similar proprietary rights in the future 
in such event  we may be forced to pursue infringement claims against such third parties 
these claims also could cause us to expend significant financial and managerial resources 
risks related to the internet our future success depends on continued growth in use of the world wide web for business to business communications 
our business could suffer if web usage does not continue to grow 
web usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  including inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service  lack of availability of cost effective and high speed service  and changes in government regulation of the web 
if web usage grows  the web infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth  or its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  future outages and other interruptions occurring throughout the web could lead to decreased use of our products and would therefore harm our business 
if we are unable to keep up with the rapid technological changes that characterize the web  our business would suffer 
our future success will depend on our ability to continually improve our solutions 
to do so  we will need to continually enhance our solutions in response to the rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards and user demands  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements that characterize the market for web products and services 
in the event new multimedia enabling technologies are developed and widely adopted  we may be required to make fundamental and costly changes in our technology 
we may not be able to make these enhancements or changes in a cost effective manner fast enough to keep up with our competitors or at all 
in this event  our business would suffer 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been extremely volatile in the past and is likely to be extremely volatile in the future  which could cause you to lose all or a part of your investment and may result in costly and distracting securities litigation 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and is likely to be extremely volatile in the future 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
the stocks of web related and technology companies like ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent months  many of which appear unrelated to the companies business  financial condition or operating results 
although the market price of our stock will in part be based on our business  financial condition and operating results  we expect that it will also be affected to a significant degree by these market wide and industry wide price and volume fluctuations 
our directors and executive officers own a significant portion of our common stock  which enables them to control matters decided by stockholders 
our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock 
as a result of their beneficial ownership  our directors and executive officers  acting alone or with others  are able to control most matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of eloquent 
this could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares or from bringing about a change in management 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities issued by corporations 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  which will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the nature of our investments an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
