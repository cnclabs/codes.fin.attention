item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general the company is a worldwide provider of biological products to life science companies 
the company s products are used in the further development of diagnostic  vaccine and therapeutic products 
the company provides value added antibody based products that are used as the active ingredients in therapeutic products for the treatment and management of diseases such as rh incompatibility in newborns  rabies and hepatitis and in diagnostic products such as blood typing reagents and diagnostic test kits 
as of march   the company conducted its operations through a national network of donor centers that specialize in the collection of specialty human antibodies 
the company also operates a protein fractionation facility in kankakee  illinois serologicals proteins or proteins that provides a variety of proteins used in diagnostic reagents and tissue culture media components for use as additives in biotech products 
a number of these products  such as bovine serum albumin bsa  are primarily supplied to healthcare companies for use in diagnostic reagents 
proteins also provides a line of highly purified animal proteins known as tissue culture media components that are used primarily by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as nutrient additives in cell culture media 
one example of these media components is bovine ex cyte r growth enhancement media supplement  which is produced through a patented manufacturing process 
the company purchased this facility in december  and the results of operations are included in the discussion below for the company s fiscal years ended december  and december  the company also operates two monoclonal antibody manufacturing facilities in scotland serologicals  ltd which are engaged in the development  manufacturing and sale of monoclonal antibodies and related products such as red cells 
for management purposes  the operations of the company s subsidiaries are organized into two primary operating segments  therapeutic products and diagnostic products 
these segments are based primarily on the differing nature of the ultimate end use of the company s products  the differing production  manufacturing and other value added processes performed by the company with respect to the products and  to a lesser extent  the differing customer bases to which each reportable segment sells its products 
the activities of the therapeutic products segment primarily include the collection and sale of specialty human antibodies that are used as the active ingredients in therapeutic products for the treatment and management of various diseases 
prior to august  the company also operated donor centers specializing in the collection of non specialty antibodies 
in august the company divested substantially all of the long term assets of its non specialty antibody business  the results of which are included in the therapeutic products segment 
the activities of the diagnostic products segment include the company s monoclonal antibody production facilities and certain human sourced  polyclonal antibodies 
while an increasing number of proteins products are being used in therapeutic end products  the management of this business is performed within the company s diagnostic business unit and  accordingly  is included in the diagnostic products reportable business segment 
the antibodies and other proteins provided by the diagnostic products segment are used in diagnostic products such as blood typing reagents and diagnostic test kits and as nutrient additives in biotech products 
divestiture of non specialty antibody business on august   the company completed the divestiture of substantially all of the long term assets of its seramed  inc seramed subsidiary for net cash consideration totaling approximately million  of which approximately million related to the sale of certain working capital assets and other settlements resulting from the divestiture 
the company retained working capital of approximately million 
the sale represented substantially all of the long term assets associated with the company s non specialty donor centers 
in connection with the divestiture  the company recorded a gain on the divestiture of seramed totaling approximately  which is included in the line item entitled special credits charges  net in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the net loss for including charges for termination benefits  lease termination costs  professional fees and an impairment loss associated with the divestiture of seramed totaled approximately million 
litigation during  twelve complaints were filed against the company and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors which allege violations of the securities exchange act of  including sections b and a thereof and rule b promulgated thereunder 
during the third quarter of  the complaints were consolidated and a lead plaintiff was named 
a consolidated complaint was filed on october  which also seeks the court s certification of the litigation as a class action on behalf of all purchasers of the company s stock between april  and april  on november   the company and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint 
on january   the plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss 
the court has not yet ruled on the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint 
although we consider all of the claims in the consolidated complaint to be without merit and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously  management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of these claims 
insurance settlement during  the company was notified by one of its customers that certain of the company s shipments of anti d antibodies in the prior year had included several units of plasma that did not meet this customer s exact product specifications 
the customer indicated to the company that the units had been partially manufactured with other units of plasma and thus had affected a substantial number of other units 
in  the company agreed to reimburse this customer for its cost of the product and recorded a liability and related expense in the amount of approximately million 
the liability with the customer was settled during the first quarter of fiscal year the company filed a claim for reimbursement from its product and professional liability insurance carrier  and was notified in the fourth quarter of that the claim had been approved for settlement 
the company recorded a receivable and the related benefit totaling million  which is included in the line item entitled special credits charges  net in the consolidated statements of income loss 
as of december   the company had received payment of approximately  and reported the balance totaling approximately million in the line item other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company received the balance of the settlement in the first quarter of industry trends increasing regulatory scrutiny continues to be a significant factor shaping the biologics industry  resulting in more detailed and frequent fda inspections of the company s and its customers operations  a potentially greater number of observations  deficiency notices and warning letters per inspection  and more product recalls and temporary or permanent closures of facilities 
one factor contributing to this trend is the fda s implementation of an approach to inspections of donor centers and laboratory testing and manufacturing facilities  including the company s customers  entitled team biologics 
under this approach  substantially all such inspections are performed by highly trained field investigators who focus extensively on the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp and quality systems 
this approach was first applied to plasma fractionators and subsequently to other biologic product areas  including certain of the company s operations 
several large fractionators  including certain of the company s customers  have been affected in varying degrees  from complete shutdowns of manufacturing facilities to operating under a consent decree to bring their facilities into compliance 
furthermore  the company believes certain manufacturers have experienced a longer than anticipated fda approval process of new  relocated or expanded manufacturing and laboratory testing facilities 
in the past  the company has received notifications and warning letters from the fda related to possible deficiencies in the company s compliance with cgmp and other fda requirements 
to date  the company believes that it has adequately addressed or corrected such deficiencies and that it is in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations 
however  since all of the company s operations have not yet been fully subjected to the fda s more intensive inspections  it is unable to determine what impact  if any  such inspections will have on the company and its operations when they occur 
another trend the industry is currently experiencing is the continuing imposition of more rigorous donor screening and other standards by the fda and certain regulatory bodies in foreign countries  in particular those governing the manufacture and sale of plasma based products in germany  which represents a significant portion of the company s sales 
furthermore  the company s customers and certain industry trade organizations continue to impose stricter standards 
such standards  including donor age restrictions  the elimination of one time and certain other infrequent donors  restrictions on donors who have traveled to certain foreign countries and the introduction of new testing techniques have reduced the pool of  and increased the competition for  potential donors 
one specific concern currently facing the industry is creutzfeld jakob disease cjd and new variant cjd nvcjd  an often fatal disease occurring sporadically in the world which has been reportedly linked in some cases to bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse  also known as mad cow disease 
however  no evidence currently exists that cjd can be transmitted by blood or plasma products and the risk  if any  is believed to be small and at present only theoretical 
while no acceptable testing or screening procedure currently exists to detect cjd  it has generally been found to have a higher incidence in the older population 
in response to this concern and at the request of several of its customers  the company has ceased collecting certain antibodies from donors over the age of at certain of its donor centers 
as a further precaution against the theoretical transmission of nvcjd  the fda has issued guidance banning plasma and blood donations from individuals that had spent extended periods of time in the united kingdom during the mad cow epidemic there from to the company produces certain bovine derived products at its protein fractionation facility in kankakee  illinois 
all of the company s products are of the lowest determinable risk  and are derived according to fda  world health organization who and european regulatory guidelines for the production of bovine source components for use in the development of critical therapeutic products 
the company takes additional measures to ensure that its bovine derived products will be free from bse  including the use of a single abattoir  which performs tests for evidence of bse both before and after processing 
the company will continue to monitor developments regarding bse and actively take steps to ensure its products are manufactured in full compliance with all of the regulatory guidelines 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated operating data of the company as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated below 
net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income before special credits charges  net and income taxes years ended december  and december  net sales consolidated consolidated net sales increased  or approximately million  from million in to million in the increase was driven by increased sales of both therapeutic products and diagnostic products over the prior year 
one factor contributing to the year over year increase was that in the company was impacted by the cancellation of anti d orders by two customers 
excluding the results of seramed  net sales increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in therapeutic products net sales of therapeutic products increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in sales of anti d antibodies and other specialty antibodies over the prior year  offset by decreased sales of non specialty antibodies resulting from the divestiture of that business in the sales were negatively impacted by order cancellations for anti d by two customers 
during  some of the lost business was recaptured  and additionally the company benefited from a large unexpected spot order for anti d during the fourth quarter 
total net sales of specialty antibodies increased million  or over the prior year  driven primarily by significant increases in anti d and anti hepatitis antibodies 
net sales of anti hepatitis antibodies increased over over the prior year levels  primarily due to additional market demand for the product  combined with some carryover shipments from that were delayed due to issues at the company s central testing laboratory that were resolved in the fourth quarter of additionally  sales of anti rabies antibodies increased over the levels 
non specialty antibody sales decreased approximately million  or  as a result of the sale of seramed in the third quarter of excluding seramed  net sales of therapeutic products increased approximately million  or from million in to million in diagnostic products net sales of diagnostic products increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in sales of blood protein products increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the majority of the increase in blood proteins was related to sales of ex cyte r 
advances in the commercialization of the company s customers end products by moving to later stage clinical trials drove the majority of the increased demand for ex cyte r 
total net sales of monoclonal antibodies and related products increased million  from million in to million in sales of monoclonal antibodies benefited from increased demand for certain products manufactured for a customer under an outsourcing arrangement under which the company began shipping in early the remaining net sales  primarily human sourced antibodies used in blood typing reagents and diagnostic test kits  increased approximately million  from million in the prior year to million in gross profit consolidated consolidated gross profit increased  or approximately million  from million in to million in the current year 
this increase was primarily the result of increased sales  primarily of relatively higher margin specialty antibodies in compared with  as well as the increased sales of the relatively higher margin ex cyte r products 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin increased from in to in the current year  largely as a result of the sales mix reflecting the increased sales of ex cyte r and the higher margin specialty antibodies  combined with the decline in sales of the relatively low margin non specialty antibodies resulting from the disposition of the seramed business 
excluding seramed  gross profit increased million  or from million in to million in  and gross margin increased from to 
therapeutic products gross profit from therapeutic products increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the current year 
this increase was primarily due to higher sales of relatively higher margin anti d antibodies  and other specialty antibodies including anti hepatitis 
additionally  gross profit on non specialty antibodies sold by seramed decreased as a result of the sale of this business 
gross margin increased from in to in  primarily as a result of the substantial increase in sales of specialty antibodies discussed above 
excluding seramed  gross profit on therapeutic products increased approximately million  from million in to million in  and gross margins decreased from in to in diagnostic products gross profit from diagnostic products increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the majority of this increase was attributable to increased sales  primarily of the higher margin ex cyte r product 
gross margin for the diagnostic products segment increased from to  primarily due to product mix as ex cyte r represented a significantly higher percentage of total diagnostic products sales compared with the prior year 
the company also benefited from production efficiencies at certain of its manufacturing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in the current year 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher corporate expenses  which included recruiting and other expenses associated with the hiring of certain executives  increased professional and legal fees  increased expenses associated with various incentive compensation programs and increased expenses associated with the company s quality and regulatory initiatives 
other expense  net consolidated other expense  net  which primarily consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and gains and losses from foreign currency translations  decreased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the current year 
the decrease was almost entirely due to a decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from the write off of million of goodwill related to seramed during the fourth quarter of  and to the subsequent divestiture of this business in august interest expense income  net consolidated interest expense increased approximately  from  in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher average borrowings under the company s line of credit  which was used primarily in the repurchase of approximately million of the company s common stock and to fund working capital during when the company experienced shipping delays for a significant number of its products 
the company repaid all of the outstanding borrowings on the line of credit during the third quarter of using proceeds from the sale of seramed 
additionally  the company repaid its outstanding convertible debt during the third quarter of special credits charges  net special credits charges  net for consist of costs incurred related to the divestiture of seramed  and the million benefit from an insurance settlement of a product liability claim previously described 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded an asset impairment charge totaling  along with approximately million of charges associated with termination benefits  lease termination costs  and other costs associated with the divestiture of the non specialty antibody business 
the company realized a gain on the disposal of seramed totaling approximately  special charges for consisted of the following items i a million product liability claim previously described  ii a million write down of the company s clinical trial site to fair market value less costs to sell  iii a write off of million of capitalized software costs as a result of terminating a project  iv a million charge related to severance and other benefits for the company s former chief executive officer and certain other individuals  and v a million impairment charge related to seramed to write the assets down to their estimated fair market value 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes as a percentage of income loss before income taxes increased from a benefit of in to a provision of in this increase was primarily due to the non deductible portion of goodwill written off during years ended december  and december  net sales consolidated consolidated net sales increased  or approximately million  from million in to million in of the increase  approximately million was attributable to the acquisition of proteins  which was offset by a net decrease in sales from its other operations 
therapeutic products net sales of therapeutic products decreased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of anti d antibodies of approximately million  due in large part to the cancellation of sales from two customers  offset by an increase in sales of non specialty antibodies 
the increase in sales of non specialty antibodies was due in large part to an increase in the percentage of the product sold on a gross pricing basis  for which the increased selling price is reflective of the company s provision of laboratory testing services and certain donor supplies that were previously borne by the customer on a net basis 
total net sales of specialty antibodies decreased approximately million  or  from million in to million in  while sales of non specialty antibodies increased million  or  from million in to million in diagnostic products net sales of diagnostic products increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in substantially all of the increase was attributable to the acquisition of proteins 
total net sales of monoclonal antibodies and related products decreased  or  from million in to million in the remaining net sales  primarily human sourced antibodies used in blood typing reagents and diagnostic test kits  decreased approximately million  or  from million in to million in gross profit consolidated consolidated gross profit decreased  or approximately million  from million in to million in this decrease resulted primarily from decreased gross profit resulting from decreased sales from existing operations  offset by approximately million resulting from the acquisition of proteins 
gross margin decreased from in to in  largely as a result of lower production at many of the company s primarily non specialty donor centers and production decreases of anti d antibodies due to reduced orders  resulting in decreased fixed cost absorption and a lower gross profit per unit 
furthermore  the company experienced increased costs of regulatory compliance 
therapeutic products gross profit from therapeutic products decreased approximately million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of relatively higher margin anti d antibodies and lower gross profit per unit due to planned production decreases in light of reduced orders 
additionally  gross profit on non specialty antibodies decreased  primarily as a result of the level of non specialty antibody production 
gross margin decreased from in to in  primarily as a result of the increase in sales of non specialty antibodies as a percent of total therapeutic products sales  from in to in finally  gross margin was also impacted by the increase in the percentage of non specialty antibodies sold on a gross basis  as there was relatively insignificant gross profit attributed to the additional revenue 
diagnostic products gross profit from diagnostic products increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the majority of this increase was attributable to the acquisition of pentex at the beginning of fiscal year  offset by lower gross profit from existing operations 
the decrease in gross profit from existing operations was primarily a result of lower sales of monoclonal antibodies  and to a lesser degree  lower gross profit per unit of sales of certain diagnostic products 
gross margin for the diagnostic products segment decreased from to  primarily due to lower sales of relatively higher margin monoclonal antibodies 
selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in of the increase  approximately million was attributable to ongoing selling  general and administrative expenses incurred as a result of the proteins acquisition  while the remainder was due to increases in general corporate overhead  offset by decreased product development expenses 
other expense  net consolidated other expense  net  which primarily consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and gains and losses from foreign currency translations  increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in of the increase  approximately  was the result of additional amortization expense associated with a decrease in the useful lives used in amortizing intangible assets of the company s non specialty antibody business and approximately  was attributable to amortization expense related to the proteins acquisition completed at the beginning of interest expense income  net consolidated interest expense income  net increased approximately million  from net interest income of  in to net interest expense of  in the increase was primarily attributable to the borrowings under the company s line of credit  used primarily in the repurchase of approximately million of the company s common stock and to fund working capital during the third and fourth quarters of when the company experienced shipping delays for a significant number of its products 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes as a percentage of income loss before income taxes decreased from in to in this change was primarily due to the non deductible portion of goodwill written off during liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain indicators of consolidated financial condition and liquidity of the company as of the following fiscal year ends in thousands cash and cash equivalents    working capital    total debt and capital lease obligations   stockholders equity    total debt to equity ratio the company has three principal sources of near term liquidity i existing cash and cash equivalents  ii cash generated by operations  and iii borrowing capacity under the company s revolving credit facility the revolver  which provides for a maximum borrowing capacity of million 
management believes the company s liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet its working capital  capital expenditure and other anticipated cash requirements over the next twelve months and may be available for use in acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million as compared to net cash used of million in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily attributable to a decreased investment in working capital of approximately million versus the prior year and increased net income of million  offset by a decrease of million of non cash special charges  and a non cash deferred income tax provision of million versus a benefit of million in the decreased investment in working capital was primarily due to a million larger decrease in inventory versus the prior year  and a million larger decrease in accounts receivable versus the prior year  offset by a decrease of approximately million in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
the significant decreases in inventory and accounts receivable were largely due to the sale of seramed during the year and the eventual liquidation of the working capital  combined with the fact that the company had substantial sales at the end of that resulted in a relatively higher accounts receivable balance at the end of net cash provided by investing activities in was million as compared with net cash used of million in the previous year 
investing activities in included net proceeds of million from the sale of seramed  offset by a million cash outflow representing partial payment of a net asset settlement related to the company s acquisition of serologicals proteins  and capital expenditures totaling approximately million 
investing activities in consisted primarily of million used for the acquisition of serologicals proteins and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in consisted primarily of the following major projects i expansion of the bovine serum albumin manufacturing capacity in kankakee  illinois  ii the acquisition of a facility in scotland that will be used to expand the company s monoclonal manufacturing operations  and iii costs associated with automating the company s donor center network 
the expenditures included expansion of the company s protein fractionation facility located in kankakee  illinois  development costs relating to a donor center automation system and routine donor center expenditures including relocations and renovations 
during  the company anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately million to million  primarily comprised of i completion of the buildout of the new monoclonal facility in scotland which was purchased in  ii a proposed expansion of the administrative office facilities at serologicals proteins  iii renovations or relocations of existing donor centers and relocation of the company s corporate headquarters to norcross  georgia  and iv various information systems initiatives 
net cash used in financing activities in was approximately million compared with net cash provided of approximately million in the prior year 
financing activities in primarily consisted of repayments of borrowings under the company s revolver as well as the repayment of million of convertible debt  the repurchase of approximately  shares of common stock for approximately million  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
financing activities in primarily consisted of borrowings under the revolver and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by repurchases of common stock 
as of december   the company had no outstanding debt  and had capital lease obligations totaling  compared with total debt and capital lease obligations outstanding at december  of million 
as previously discussed  the company used the proceeds from the sale of seramed to repay the debt outstanding under the line of credit 
additionally  million of convertible debt was repaid upon maturity in september market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
foreign currency exchange rates the company s foreign based operations are conducted primarily through its serologicals  ltd 
subsidiary located in the united kingdom 
in  and  foreign based operations accounted for approximately  and of net sales and approximately  and of income from operations sales minus cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively 
the functional currency of serologicals  ltd 
is the british pound sterling 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can impact operating results  including net revenues and expenses  when translations of the subsidiary financial statements are made in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
furthermore  the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  subjecting it to exposure from movements in the exchange rates of those countries 
however  a large portion of the company s sales to foreign countries is denominated in us currency  thus mitigating a significant portion of this risk 
it has not been the company s practice to hedge its assets and liabilities in the uk or its intercompany transactions and  accordingly  has not used derivatives or other off balance sheet items to manage any significant foreign currency exchange risk 
in  and  the company recorded foreign currency transaction gains losses of approximately   and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in values of derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
which modifies certain sections of sfas no 
the company has completed its evaluation of the impact of sfas no 
 and as of december   the company does not have any derivative instruments required to be accounted for under sfas no 
therefore  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
on january  will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
this bulletin summarized certain of the sec s views regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements
