item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
in order to provide a measure of control over price and supply  the company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations 
the company also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily utilizing futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges and fuel swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel based on projected fuel usage  which would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million at december  as of december   the company had hedged approximately of its first quarter fuel requirements  compared to of the first quarter of and of the full year at december  foreign currency 
the company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
the company s largest exposure comes from the japanese yen 
from time to time  the company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the japanese yen 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company s revenues and expenses are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ending december   net of gains realizable from yen hedge instruments outstanding at december   compared to an estimated million decrease at december  this is due to the company s foreign currency denominated revenues exceeding its foreign currency denominated expenses 
the company also has a foreign currency non cash exposure 
the result of a weakening in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease to other income caused by the remeasurement of net foreign currency denominated liabilities of an estimated million in compared with an estimated million at december  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as of december  and in  the company s yen denominated revenues exceeded its yen denominated expenses by approximately billion yen approximately million and its yen denominated liabilities exceeded its yen denominated assets by an average of billion yen approximately million compared with billion yen approximately million and eight billion yen approximately million  respectively  in in general  each time the yen strengthens weakens  the company s operating income is favorably unfavorably impacted due to net yen denominated revenues exceeding expenses and a non operating foreign currency loss gain is recognized due to the remeasurement of net yen denominated liabilities 
the company s operating income in was favorably impacted by approximately million due to the average yen being stronger in compared to and in by approximately million due to the average yen being stronger in compared to the average yen to us dollar exchange rate  including hedge activity impact  during december   and was  and  respectively 
the japanese yen financial instruments utilized to hedge net yen denominated cash flows resulted in gains of million in and losses of million in as of december   the company had entered into forward contracts to hedge approximately of its anticipated yen denominated sales  compared to at december   which also represents approximately of the company s excess of yen denominated revenues over expenses in and interest 
the company s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments and its interest expense from floating rate debt instruments 
the company has mitigated this risk by limiting its floating rate indebtedness to approximately and of long term debt and capital leases at december  and  respectively 
the company used financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuation on the variable rate portion of its pass through certificates issued in if long term floating interest rates average more in than they did during  the company s net interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  if short term interest rates average more in than they did during  the company s interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments would increase by approximately million compared to an estimated million for measured at december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s floating rate indebtedness  cash equivalent and short term investment balances at december  and market risk for fixed rate indebtedness is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million during  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  the fair values of the company s indebtedness were estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements
