as described in item of this k under the caption sales of unregistered securities  on december   the company closed a million private placement of common stock and warrants to two institutional investors  and on december   the company and such investors entered into exchange agreements relating to the exchange of certain of the warrants issued to such investors in for new warrants and promissory notes 
on january   the company signed an asset purchase agreement with a newly organized privately held company named meeting maker  inc mmi to sell the company s groupware business meeting maker subject to the approval of the company s stockholders 
in connection with the asset purchase agreement  the company entered into a management agreement  also dated january   in which the company transferred effective control of the groupware business meeting maker to mmi 
on had no risk of ownership related to the operating results from the groupware business since january  and has allocated of the net income loss to mmi for the period january  to june  the company did not receive the required number of shareholder votes to approve the meeting maker transaction 
as a result  the company entered into a license agreement with mmi effective as of june  which  among other things  terminated the previously negotiated sale arrangement and provided for the grant of an exclusive worldwide license to market and distribute the meeting maker product including a license to the underlying source code and object code 
the company receives quarterly royalty payments  subject to certain minimums  from mmi in connection with the exclusive license 
at any time during the license period  mmi has the ability to exercise a buyout option for the remaining minimum payments plus an additional fee 
the company is recognizing the royalty fees as earned  during the year ended december  in other revenue 
additionally  the license agreement provided for the sale of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities related to the meeting maker business 
as a result  the company recognized a gain of  net of related transaction costs  in the quarter ended september   which is reported in other income 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
software license revenue consists principally of revenue earned under perpetual software license agreements and is generally recognized upon shipment of the software if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements to allow allocation of the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
revenues under such arrangements  which may include multiple software products and services sold together  are allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with sop no  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized when earned 
the company has established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence for professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
accordingly  software license revenue is recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
service revenues from time and expense contracts and consulting and training revenue are recognized as the related services are performed

the company believes that its existing cash balances and expected funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance the company s operations through december  certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
in addition  from time to time  management may make forward looking statements in press releases  in other public discussions and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission including those documents incorporated by reference into this form k 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for these statements 
for this purpose  a forward looking statement is any statement that is not a statement of historical fact 
you can identify forward looking statements by the words may  believes  anticipates  plans  expects  estimates and similar expressions 
our forward looking statements are based on currently available information and management s expectations of future results but necessarily involve certain assumptions 
we caution readers that our assumptions involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
consequently  any forward looking statement could turn out to be wrong 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
below we describe some of the important factors that could affect our revenues or results of operations 
the company is currently experiencing cash flow deficits and may continue to experience cash flow deficits in the foreseeable future 
for the fiscal year ended december   on had operating losses of approximately million  producing significant negative cash flow 
management s operating plan forecasts that the company will continue to experience operating losses and negative cash flows at least through the later half of based on these assumptions  management believes its has sufficient cash to fund its operations for if the company is unable to attain forecasted revenue levels and management is further unable to curtail expenses  the company would have to seek external equity or debt financing to continue its operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such external financing 
our marketing requires significant investments sales of products require significant up front investments in marketing  technical and financial resources 
we have adopted a marketing strategy using a direct sales force and in field service organization 
this strategy requires significant investments in marketing and technical personnel  retraining of existing personnel  ongoing product development and creation of an in field service organization 
we have developed valuable marketing and service experience and expertise in europe and  recently  in the united states 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to expand and apply such experience and expertise to our target market 
a significant portion of our revenues derives from a relatively small number of customers for the twelve months ended december   one customer accounted for million  or of total revenue from on s current products 
for the twelve months ended december   two customers accounted for million  or of total revenue 
for the twelve months ended december   two customers accounted for million  or of total revenue 
it is possible that in the future other customers will account for more than of on s total revenues 
we will need to expand our distribution channels in order to develop our business and increase revenue we sell our products through our direct sales force and a number of distributors  and we provide maintenance and support services through our technical and customer support staff 
we plan to continue to invest large amounts of resources in our direct sales force  particularly in north america 
in addition  we are developing additional sales and marketing channels through value added resellers  system integrators  original equipment manufacturers and other channel partners 
we may not be able to attract channel partners that will be able to market our products effectively  or that will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
if we establish distribution through such indirect channels  our agreements with channel partners may not be exclusive 
as a result  such channel partners may also carry competing product lines 
if we do not establish and maintain such distribution relationships  this could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if the market for our enterprise desktop management software solutions does not continue to develop as we anticipate  our ability to grow our business and sell our products will be adversely affected in recent years  the market for enterprise software solutions has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product announcements and introductions  and evolving industry standards 
in response to advances in technology  customer requirements have become increasingly complex  resulting in industry consolidation of product lines offering similar or related functionality 
in particular  we believe that a market exists for integrated enterprise wide infrastructure management solutions 
however  the existence of such a market is unproven 
if such a market does not fully develop  this could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
regardless of the development of a market for integrated infrastructure management solutions  factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of our enterprise desktop management applications could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards  or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  sales of our products may decline as a result of rapid technological change in our industry  our position in existing markets or other markets that we may enter can be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance depend in part upon our ability to improve existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer needs  and respond to competitive products 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
the technological requirements of our products may present challenges in product development which  if we cannot meet  may have a material adverse effect on our business the technological demands of our current products require a commitment of significant ongoing financial  technical and personnel resources to product development  training of service technicians and customer training 
because our historical products were not as technologically sophisticated as our current products  we have not to date made all of the required investment and have not proven that we can develop and maintain the organization required to support such products 
we believe that our experience to date will provide a valuable base on which to build the necessary financial  technical and personnel resources to continue to sell  market  develop and support our products 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand and develop our resources to support our products 
our current products are typically larger and more complex than the products that we have previously developed 
our ability to continue to enhance our current products to meet customer and market requirements will depend substantially on our ability to effectively manage this development effort  to attract and retain the required development personnel in waltham  massachusetts and starnberg  germany and to coordinate and manage geographically remote development efforts 
we have experienced product development delays in the past and may experience delays in the future 
difficulties in product development could delay or prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or improved products 
any such new or improved products may not achieve market acceptance 
our current or future products may not conform to industry requirements 
if  for technological or other reasons  we are unable to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely manner  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
errors in our products could result in significant costs to us and could impair our ability to sell our products because our software products are complex  these products may contain errors that could be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delays in shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors 
despite testing by on and by current and potential customers  errors in our products may be found in the future 
detection of such errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
if any of these results were to occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in the future  inclusion of functions provided by our products in system software and application suites may affect our competitive position in the future  vendors of operating system software and applications sold for a single price generally referred to as application suites may continue to enhance their products to include functions that are currently provided by our products 
in addition  some vendors may bundle these products in their existing application suites at no additional charge 
the widespread inclusion of the functions provided by our products as standard features of operating system software could render our products obsolete and unmarketable particularly if the quality of such functions were comparable to the functions offered by our products 
furthermore  even if the software functions provided as standard features by operating systems are more limited than those of our products  there is no assurance that a significant number of customers would not elect to accept such functions instead of purchasing additional software 
if we were unable to develop new software products to further enhance operating systems and to successfully replace any obsolete products  our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
new product introductions and the enhancement of existing products by our competitors could adversely affect our ability to sell our products the market for the company s products is highly competitive  and the company expects competition to continue to increase in the future 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for its products include brand name recognition  company reputation  performance  functionality  ease of use  breadth of product line  quality  customer support  adherence to industry standards  integration with third party solutions and price 
as is the case in many segments of the software industry  the company may encounter increasing price competition in the future 
this could reduce average selling prices and  therefore  profit margins 
competitive pressures could result not only in sustained price reductions but also in a decline in sales volume  which could adversely affect the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively against existing and potential competitors in its markets  many of whom have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and support resources and name recognition than the company 
the widespread inclusion of the functionality of the company s products as standard features of microsoft operating systems software could render the company s products obsolete and unmarketable  particularly if the quality of such functionality were comparable to that of the company s products 
if the company were unable to develop new functionality or unique applications for its technology to replace successfully any obsolete products  the company s business  condition financial or otherwise  prospects and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse 
the technology for remote software management products can change rapidly 
new products are frequently introduced and existing products are continually enhanced 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
the company has faced competition from a number of sources  including o large and established companies such as microsoft  computer associates international and ibm tivoli which offer remote software delivery and management capabilities as part of their systems management  or network management frameworks 
o software companies and others who provide software management utilities and suites such as symantec  intel  and altiris 
o hardware suppliers such as ibm  hewlett packard  and compaq that offer or bundle software management capabilities in conjunction with their hardware offerings 
o the internal information technology departments of those companies with infrastructure management needs 
in addition  microsoft has bundled new management capabilities in its windows operating system that  in conjunction with its systems management server sms framework  directly compete with capabilities provided by on command ccm 
even if the functionality provided with microsoft s operating system software were more limited than that of our software management products  customers or potential customers might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software 
competition resulting from this type of bundling could lead to price reductions for our products  which would reduce our margins and correspondingly affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
some of our current and many of our potential competitors have much greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than the company has 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products than the company can 
the company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures faced by the company may materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
new competitors and alliances among existing competitors could impair our ability to retain and expand our market share because competitors can easily penetrate the software market  we anticipate additional competition from other established and new companies as the market for enterprise desktop management applications develops 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
large software companies may acquire or establish alliances with our smaller competitors 
we expect that the software industry will continue to consolidate 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
due to the technological challenges associated with our current products  we may not have the financial resources necessary to conduct the business as presently contemplated based on forecasts  our product development  marketing and sales costs for our current products are approximately  to  per month 
based on our existing cash and forecasted revenue  we believe that we have enough cash to fund these costs through there can be no assurance that our estimate of the marketing  sales and product development costs of the ccm products is correct  or that these costs will not exceed our available financial resources  or that we will be locate additional sources of financing  if and when needed 
our increasing reliance on international revenue could adversely affect our operating results in fiscal and fiscal  total revenue from international licenses license revenue from outside the united states represented approximately of our total revenue 
for the fiscal year  total revenue from international licenses represented approximately of our total revenue and of our net ccm and related products revenue 
we expect that international revenue will constitute a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
accordingly  a significant percentage of our total revenue may be subject to the risks inherent in international sales  including the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on demand for our products  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  seasonality due to the slowdown of european business activity in the third quarter and tariffs and other trade barriers 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a materially adverse effect on our future international license revenue 
our continued growth and profitability will require continued expansion of our international operations  particularly in europe  latin america  and the pacific rim 
accordingly  we intend to expand our current international operations and enter additional international markets 
such expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we have only limited experience in developing local language versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell and deliver our products internationally 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as our expanding international operations in europe and elsewhere are increasingly conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency exchange losses a large portion of our business is conducted in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
we may implement a foreign exchange hedging program  consisting principally of purchases of one month forward rate currency contracts 
however  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
on january   certain member states of the european economic community the eec fixed their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro 
on that date  the euro became a functional legal currency within these countries 
during the three years beginning on january   business in these eec member states will be conducted in both the existing national currencies  such as the french franc or deutsche mark  and the euro 
issues related to the introduction of the euro may materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
future fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our stock price our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others o our ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our software on a timely basis  o market demand for our software  o the size  timing and contractual terms of significant orders  o the timing and significance of new software product announcements or releases by on or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or our competitors  o changes in our business strategies  o budgeting cycles of our potential customers  o changes in the mix of software products and services sold  o reliance on indirect sales forces like systems integrators and channels  o changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  o the impact of acquisitions of competitors  o seasonal trends  o the cancellations of licenses or maintenance agreements  o product life cycles  software defects and other product quality problems  and o personnel changes 
we have often recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the last month or weeks of that quarter 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing of revenue recognition can be affected by many factors  including the timing of contract execution and delivery 
the timing between initial customer contact and fulfillment of criteria for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenues in any given quarter can be adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
in the event of any downturn in potential customers businesses or the economy in general  planned purchases of our products may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  and potential delays in the cycle make our revenues susceptible to fluctuations the licensing of our software generally requires us to engage in a sales cycle that typically takes approximately four to nine months to complete 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including the size of the transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
during the sales cycle  we typically provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products may affect our quarterly operating results our business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality 
our revenues and operating results in our december quarter typically benefit from purchase decisions made by the large concentration of customers with calendar year end budgeting requirements  and from the efforts of our sales force to meet fiscal year end sales quotas 
in addition  we are currently attempting to expand our presence in international markets  including europe 
international revenues comprise a significant percentage of our total revenues  and we may experience additional variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in such foreign markets 
future acquisitions present risks which could adversely affect our business in the future  on may make acquisitions of  or large investments in  other businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that further our goal of providing enterprise desktop management software solutions to businesses or which complement our current business 
any future acquisitions or investments that we may complete present risks commonly encountered with these types of transactions 
the following are examples of such risks o difficulty in combining the technology  operations  or work force of the acquired business  o disruption of on going businesses  o difficulty in realizing the potential financial and strategic position of on through the successful integration of the acquired business  o difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  o possible impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel  o difficulty in adding significant numbers of new employees  including training  evaluation  and coordination of effort of all employees towards our corporate mission  o diversion of management attention  o difficulty in obtaining preferred acquisition accounting treatment for these types of transactions  likelihood that future acquisitions will require purchase accounting resulting in increased intangible assets and goodwill  substantial amortization of such assets and goodwill  and a negative impact on reported earnings  and o potential dilutive effect on earnings 
the risks described above  either individually or in the aggregate  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
future acquisitions  if any  could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of on common stock  or a combination of cash and on common stock 
our ability to manage growth will affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability total ccm and related products revenues grew significantly from to  increasing from million to million  respectively 
in fiscal total ccm and related products revenues decreased slightly from levels  to million 
if we achieve our growth plans  such growth may burden our operating and financial systems 
this burden will require large amounts of senior management attention and will require the use of other on resources 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth and our future operating results will depend in part on our ability to implement and expand operational  customer support  and financial control systems and to expand  train  and manage our employees 
in particular  in connection with acquisitions  we will be required to integrate additional personnel and to augment or replace existing financial and management systems 
such integration could disrupt our operations and could adversely affect our financial results 
we may not be able to augment or improve existing systems and controls or implement new systems and controls in response to future growth  if any 
any failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our business depends in large part upon the protection of our proprietary technology the loss of which would have a material adverse affect on our business our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets and copyright to establish and protect our proprietary rights in software 
we use a printed shrink wrap license for users of our products distributed through traditional distribution channels in order to protect our copyrights and trade secrets in those products 
since the licensee does not sign these shrink wrap licenses  many authorities believe that they may not be enforceable under many state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
if such licenses are not enforceable  the user would not be bound by the license terms  including the terms that seek to protect our proprietary technology 
if the printed shrink wrap licenses prove to be unenforceable  this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect our proprietary rights or offer only limited protection for those rights 
furthermore  in countries with a high incidence of software piracy  we may experience a higher rate of piracy of our products 
we have obtained registrations in the united states for the following trademarks on technology  meeting maker  ccm  on command ccm  notework  davinci systems  on technology design  on location and instant update 
we have filed for the trademark on command ccm in the european community  canada and australia 
as a result  we may not be able to prevent a third party from using our trademarks in many foreign jurisdictions 
we have not to date registered any of our copyrights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by on to protect our proprietary software technology will be adequate 
lesser sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to avoiding infringement of propriety rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights of technology companies 
we have not been involved in any such litigation 
although we do not believe that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others  any involvement in this type of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
in addition  since we may acquire or license a portion of the software included in our future products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of any software being acquired 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software and we generally obtain indemnification to cover any breach of such representations 
however  there can be no assurance that these representations are accurate or that such indemnification will provide us with adequate compensation for a breach of these representations 
in the future  we may need to initiate litigation to enforce and protect trade secrets and other intellectual property rights owned by us 
we may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could be costly and cause diversion of management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
adverse rulings or findings in such litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
any one of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business  condition  prospects and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any necessary licenses will be available to us on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
such laws provide only limited protection 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in particular  we may provide our licensees with access to our data model and other proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
additionally  our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and  while we do not expect software piracy to be a persistent problem  some foreign laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
third parties could assert  for competitive or other reasons  that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  and such claims could injure our reputation  consume time and money  and adversely affect our ability to sell our products while we are not aware that any of our software product offerings infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  third parties may claim infringement with respect to our current or future products 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
as a result  infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs to us our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
such limitation of liability provisions may  however  not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims 
we may be subject to such claims in the future 
a product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our senior management and other key personnel are critical to our business  and if they choose to leave on  it could harm our business our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and certain other key employees  including selected sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  few of our employees are bound by an employment or noncompetition agreement 
in addition  we do not generally maintain key man life insurance on any employee 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or the decision of one or more such officers or employees to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  sales  management  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and in the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products 
we may not succeed in attracting and retaining such personnel 
if we do not  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
future changes in the federal immigration laws could limit our ability to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries  and this could adversely affect our business and operating results to achieve our business objectives  we must be able to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries 
any future shortage of qualified technical personnel who are either united states citizens or otherwise eligible to work in the united states could increase our reliance on foreign professionals 
many technology companies have already begun to experience shortages of such personnel 
any failure to attract and retain qualified personnel as necessary could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
foreign computer professionals such as those employed by us typically become eligible for employment in the united states by obtaining a nonimmigrant visa 
the number of nonimmigrant visas is limited by federal immigration law 
currently  congress is considering approving an increase in the number of visas available 
we cannot predict whether such legislation will ultimately become law 
we also cannot predict what effect any future changes in the federal immigration laws will have on our business  operating results  or financial condition

these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights 
however  they could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for on s shares 
as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of on common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in the management of on 
on s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by on s stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock allows on to have flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by the on stockholders

in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a company and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions 
on has not opted out of the antitakeover provisions of delaware law 
our stock will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations which may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares in the past  the market price of our common stock has varied greatly and the volume of our common stock traded has fluctuated greatly as well 
we expect such fluctuation to continue 
the fluctuation results from a number of factors including o any shortfall in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts  o announcements of new products by on or our competitors  o quarterly fluctuations in our financial results or the results of other software companies  including those of our direct competitors  o changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  the financial performance of our competitors  or the financial performance of software companies in general  o general conditions in the software industry  o changes in prices for our products or the products of our competitors  o changes in our revenue growth rates or the growth rates of our competitors  o sales of large blocks of on common stock  and o conditions in the financial markets in general 
in addition  the stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many technology companies  in particular  have experienced such fluctuations 
often  such fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  stock price risk based on on s future common stock price  and investment changes 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash equivalent investments 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments 
the company invests its excess cash in short term floating rate instruments and senior secured floating rate loan funds  which carry a degree of interest rate risk 
these instruments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries and other foreign sources for the year ended december  were approximately of total revenues 
international sales are made primarily from the company s subsidiary in germany and are denominated in the local currency 
accordingly  the company s german subsidiary uses the local currency as its functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risk typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall profitability 
on s stock price risk 
in accordance with eitf  the outstanding warrants resulting from the exchange agreements  described in item  have been recorded at fair value at each exercise and reporting period date with any changes in the fair value included in the results of operations 
the company calculates the fair value of these warrants using the black scholes option pricing model  for which on s stock price and volatility are factors 
the principal amount of the notes received by the investors resulting from the exchange agreements  as described in item  is due and payable on december   unless a registration statement covering all the shares of the company s common stock that are entitled to be registered under the exchange agreements is effective for not less than trading days during the period beginning november  and ending december  the measurement period and the average closing price of the company s common stock for the last trading days during the measurement period when such registration statement is effective exceeds per share as adjusted to reflect any stock splits  reverse stock splits  stock dividends or similar events 
investment risk 
the company may invest in the future in the equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
however  as of december   the company holds no such material investments 
for these non quoted investments  the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the company identifies and records impairment losses on long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired
