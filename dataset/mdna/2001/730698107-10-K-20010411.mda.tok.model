cautionary statements and risk factors in our capacity as company management  we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements with respect to our long term objectives or expectations which may be included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  reports to stockholders and information provided in our web site 
the words or phrases will likely  are expected to  is anticipated  is predicted  forecast  estimate  project  plans to continue  believes  or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected 
we wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions on the private securities litigation reform act of  we are calling to your attention important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements 
the following list of important factors may not be all inclusive  and we specifically decline to undertake an obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements that have been made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve expected operating results and growth plan goals and or affect the market price of our stock are our highly competitive marketplace 
the risks associated with dependence upon significant customers 
our ability to execute our expansion strategy 
the uncertain ability to manage growth 
our dependence upon and our ability to adapt to technological developments 
dependence on key personnel 
our ability to maintain and improve service quality 
fluctuation in quarterly operating results and seasonality in certain of our markets 
possible significant influence over corporate affairs by significant shareholders 
the potential impact of a possible labor action affecting our studio and television customers 
these risk factors are discussed further below 
competition 
our broadcast video post production  duplication and distribution industry is a highly competitive  service oriented business 
in general  we do not have long term or exclusive service agreements with our customers 
business is acquired on a purchase order basis and is based primarily on customer satisfaction with reliability  timeliness  quality and price 
we compete with a variety of post production  duplication and distribution firms  some of which have a national presence  and to a lesser extent  the in house post production and distribution operations of major motion picture studios and advertising agencies 
some of these firms  and all of the studios  have greater financial  distribution and marketing resources and have achieved a higher level of brand recognition than the company 
in the future  we may not be able to compete effectively against these competitors merely on the basis of reliability  timeliness quality and price or otherwise 
we may also face competition from companies in related markets which could offer similar or superior services to those offered by the company 
for example  telecommunications providers could enter the market as competitors with materially lower electronic delivery transportation costs 
we believe that an increasingly competitive environment could lead to a loss of market share or price reductions  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
customer and industry concentration 
although we have an active client list of over  customers  seven motion picture studios accounted for approximately of the company s revenues during the year ended december  if one or more of these companies were to stop using our services  our business could be adversely affected 
because we derive substantially all of our revenue from clients in the entertainment and advertising industries  the financial condition  results of operations and prospects of the company could also be adversely affected by an adverse change in conditions which impact those industries 
expansion strategy 
our growth strategy involves both internal development and expansion through acquisitions 
we currently have no agreements or commitments to acquire any company or business 
even though we have completed eight acquisitions in the last three fiscal years  we cannot be sure additional acceptable acquisitions will be available or that we will be able to reach mutually agreeable terms to purchase acquisition targets  or that we will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
certain of the businesses previously acquired by the company reported net losses for their most recent fiscal years prior to being acquired  and our future financial performance will be in part depend on our ability to implement operational improvements in  or exploit potential synergies with  these acquired businesses 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including adverse effects on our reported operating results including the amortization of acquired goodwill  diversion of management s attention and unanticipated problems or legal liabilities 
in addition  we may require additional funding to finance future acquisitions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to secure acquisition financing on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also use working capital or equity  or raise financing through equity offerings or the incurrence of debt  in connection with the funding of any acquisition 
some or all of these risks could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and prospects or could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
in addition  to the extent that consolidation becomes more prevalent in the industry  the prices for attractive acquisition candidates could increase substantially 
we may not be able to effect any such transactions 
additionally  if we are able to complete such transactions they may prove to be unprofitable 
the geographic expansion of the company s customers may result in increased demand for services in certain regions where it currently does not have post production  duplication and distribution facilities 
to meet this demand  we may subcontract 
however  we have not entered into any formal negotiations or definitive agreements for this purpose 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect such transactions or that any such transactions will prove to be profitable 
management of growth 
during the last four years except for  we have experienced rapid growth that has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and has placed and continues to place increased demands on our management  operational and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate this growth  compete effectively and manage future growth  we will be required to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
we cannot be sure that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
dependence on technological developments 
although we intend to utilize the most efficient and cost effective technologies available for telecine  high definition formatting  editing  coloration and delivery of video content  including digital satellite transmission  as they develop  we cannot be sure that we will be able to adapt to such standards in a timely fashion or at all 
we believe our future growth will depend in part  on our ability to add to these services and to add customers in a timely and cost effective manner 
we cannot be sure we will be successful in offering such services to existing customers or in obtaining new customers for these services  including the company s recent investment in the high definition television area 
we intend to rely on third part vendors for the development of these technologies and there is no assurance that such vendors will be able to develop such technologies in a manner that meets the needs of the company and its customers 
any material interruption in the supply of such services could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent on the efforts and abilities of certain of its senior management  particularly those of r 
luke stefanko  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer 
the loss or interruption of the services of key members of management could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects if a suitable replacement is not promptly obtained 
although we have employment agreements with mr 
stefanko and certain of our other key executives and technical personnel  we cannot be sure that such executives will remain with the company during or after the term of their employment agreements 
in addition  our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  sales  operations  marketing and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the loss of any such persons  as well as the failure to recruit additional key personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel for the development of our business 
ability to maintain and improve service quality 
our business is dependent on our ability to meet the current and future demands of our customers  which demands include reliability  timeliness  quality and price 
any failure to do so  whether or not caused by factors within our control could result in losses to such clients 
although we disclaim any liability for such losses  there is no assurance that claims would not be asserted or that dissatisfied customers would refuse to make further deliveries through the company in the event of a significant occurrence of lost deliveries  either of which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
although we maintain insurance against business interruption  such insurance may not be adequate to protect the company from significant loss in these circumstances or that a major catastrophe such as an earthquake or other natural disaster would not result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
in addition  our ability to make deliveries within the time periods requested by customers depends on a number of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including equipment failure  work stoppages by package delivery vendors or interruption in services by telephone or satellite service providers 
fluctuating results  seasonality 
our operating results have varied in the past  and may vary in the future  depending on factors such as the volume of advertising in response to seasonal buying patterns  the timing of new product and service introductions  the timing of revenue recognition upon the completion of longer term projects  increased competition  timing of acquisitions  general economic factors and other factors 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
for example  our operating results have historically been significantly influenced by the volume of business from the motion picture industry  which is an industry that is subject to seasonal and cyclical downturns  and  occasionally  work stoppages by actors  writers and others 
in addition  as our business from advertising agencies tends to be seasonal  our operating results may be subject to increased seasonality as the percentage of business from advertising agencies increases 
in any period our revenues are subject to variation based on changes in the volume and mix of services performed during the period 
it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of equity research analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in sales due to seasonality may become more pronounced if the growth rate of the company s sales slows 
control by principal shareholder  potential issuance of preferred stock  anti takeover provisions 
the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  r 
luke stefanko  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding common stock as of december  mr 
stefanko s ex spouse owned approximately of the common stock on that date 
together  they owned approximately 
in august  mr 
stefanko was granted a one time proxy to vote his ex spouse s shares in connection with the election of directors at the company s annual meeting 
by virtue of his stock ownership  mr 
stefanko may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters required to be submitted to a vote of shareholders  including i the election of the board of directors  ii amendments to the company s restated articles of incorporation and iii approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the foregoing may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of the company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without par value the preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof  including voting rights  without any further vote or action by the company s shareholders 
although we have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock  the rights of the holders of common stock would be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of the company 
furthermore  certain provisions of the company s restated articles of incorporation and by laws and of california law also could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
possible strike affecting our customers 
in may and july  screenwriters and actors  respectively  may conduct a work stoppage directly affecting our studio and television customers 
we cannot predict the length of a strike by either of these groups or the ultimate impact on our customers production and ability to provide work to the company 
either work stoppage  should it occur  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations
