item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis addresses the company s results of operations on a historical consolidated basis for the years ended december  and the following should be read in conjunction with the company s historical consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data contained elsewhere in this report 
the company is one of the largest operators and developers of senior living communities in the united states in terms of resident capacity 
the company s operating strategy is to provide high quality senior living services at an affordable price to its residents  while achieving and sustaining a strong  competitive position within its chosen markets  as well as to continue to enhance the performance of its operations 
the company provides a wide array of senior living services to the elderly at its communities  including independent living  assisted living with special programs and living units at some of its communities for residents with alzheimer s and other forms of dementia  skilled nursing  and home care services 
the company completed its initial public offering in november in conjunction with a series of transactions that resulted in the company acquiring various companies  partnership interests and assets from the company s founders and entities affiliated with its founders 
these transactions are collectively called the formation transactions 
because certain of the entities and assets acquired in the formation transactions were subchapter s corporations  partnership interests or other flow through entities for tax purposes  and because certain debt obligations were assumed in the formation transactions and subsequently repaid with some of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering  the year to year changes in the company s financial statements are not directly comparable 
during the years through  the company acquired interests in and continues to own communities and expanded its senior living management services by entering into management service contracts on communities for three independent third party owners and commenced providing development and construction management services for new residence properties in addition to adding a home care service agency 
the company generates revenue from a variety of sources 
for the year ended december   the company s revenue was derived as follows from the operation of owned communities including eight properties acquired from ilm in august  that were previously operated by the company under a management contract  from lease rentals from triple net leases  from management fees arising from management services provided for affiliate owned senior living communities and third party owned senior living communities including revenue from eight of the ilm communities prior to their acquisition  and from development fees earned for managing the development and construction of new senior living communities for third parties 
the company believes that the factors affecting the financial performance of communities managed under contracts with third parties do not vary substantially from the factors affecting the performance of owned and leased communities  although there are different business risks associated with these activities 
the company s third party management fees are primarily based on a percentage of gross revenues 
as a result  the cash flow and profitability of such contracts to the company are more dependent on the revenues generated by such communities and less dependent on net cash flow than for owned communities 
further  the company is not responsible for capital investments in managed communities 
while the management contracts are generally terminable only for cause  in certain cases the contracts can be terminated upon the sale of a community  subject to the company s rights to offer to purchase such community 
the company s triple net leases extend through the year for two of its owned communities and through the year for four of its owned communities three of which were sold in fiscal 
the payments under these leases are fixed and are not subject to change based upon the operating performance of these communities 
following termination of the lease agreements  unless the operators extend their leases  the company may either convert and operate the communities as assisted living and alzheimer s care facilities  sell the facilities or evaluate other alternatives 
the company s current management contracts expire on various dates through december and provide for management fees based generally upon rates that vary by contract from of net revenues to of net revenues 
in addition  certain of the contracts provide for supplemental incentive fees that vary by contract based upon the financial performance of the managed community 
the company s development fees are generally based upon a percentage of construction cost and are earned over the period commencing with the initial development activities and ending with the opening of the community 
as of december   development fees have been earned for services performed for communities under development or expansions for third parties 
during   and  the company made various purchases of limited partnership interests in hcp 
hcp owns and operates a skilled nursing facility and owns and leases to third party operators under triple net leases three skilled nursing facilities and four physical rehabilitation centers three of which have been sold 
during   and  the company paid approximately million  million  and million  respectively  for partnership interests in hcp 
as a result of additional purchases  the company s ownership interest in hcp exceeded on june  and was at december  accordingly  this partial acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting  and the assets  liabilities  minority interest  and the results of operations of hcp have been consolidated in the company s financial statements since january  the company acquired  on november   the nhp notes owned by cslc in the formation transactions for million 
the nhp notes bear simple interest at per annum and mature on december  interest is currently paid quarterly at a rate of  with the remaining interest deferred 
from november  through september   the company recorded interest income at of the purchase price paid  which was determined based on the discounted amount of principal and interest payments to be made following the maturity date december  of the nhp notes using a six month lag between maturity and full repayment  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of the accrued interest 
on september   the company purchased four properties from nhp 
nhp in turn redeemed million of the company s investment in the nhp notes and distributed approximately million of deferred interest not previously paid on such notes 
from october  through december   the company reevaluated its investment in the nhp notes and began recording additional income after giving consideration to current payment of interest  partial redemption of the nhp notes with accrued interest and the estimated residual value in nhp 
this change in estimate resulted in million of additional income in in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reevaluated the assumptions related to its investment in the nhp notes  and as a result reduced the income expected to be earned from the nhp notes 
this change in estimate resulted in a million reduction in interest income in the fourth quarter of the company continues to develop and plans to acquire senior living communities 
the development of senior living communities typically involves a substantial commitment of capital over an approximate month construction period during which time no revenues are generated  followed by a to month lease up period 
the company anticipates that newly opened or expanded communities will operate at a loss during a substantial portion of the lease up period 
the company s growth strategy may also include the acquisition of senior living communities  home care agencies  and other properties or businesses that are complementary to the company s operations and growth strategy

each triad entity finances the development of new communities through a combination of equity funding  traditional construction loans and permanent financing with institutional lenders secured by first liens on the communities and unsecured loans from the company 
the chart below sets forth information about the financings from institutional lenders and the company loans 
the company loans may be prepaid without penalty

the amount shown was funded by the company pursuant to operating deficit loan obligations 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
however  inflation could affect the company s future revenues and results of operations because of  among other things  the company s dependence on senior residents  many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  during inflationary periods  the company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring its fees  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures
