certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees  or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements that are forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the company s shipment levels  profitability  business and industry outlook  and sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
the words expect  anticipate  plan  believe  seek  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
many such factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information  future events  or otherwise 
important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  which generally have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment and have adversely affected the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that developments in the semiconductor industry or the semiconductor equipment industry will occur at the rate or in the manner expected by the company 
in addition to the cyclical nature  risks  and uncertainties of the semiconductor industry  the company faces the following risks and uncertainties among others the need to continuously develop  manufacture  and gain customers acceptance of new products and product enhancements  dependence on a limited number of customers and concentration of sales to one or a few customers  the company s ability to attract and retain certain key personnel  the ability of the company to protect its technology assets by obtaining and enforcing patents  and dependence on sole and limited source suppliers for certain components and subassemblies included in the company s products and systems 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially affect its business  financial position  results of operations  and stock price 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states through its foreign subsidiaries 
the foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts on a continuing basis to offset the currency exposures 
the gains and losses on these transactions partially offset the unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses of the underlying exposure 
these gains and losses were immaterial for the years presented and were included in cost of sales 
the company plans to continue to use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the notional amount of the company s outstanding foreign currency contracts at december   was  the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in forward currency exchange rates at december   would be  the potential loss was estimated calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december   and comparing that with the value calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
credit risk the company is exposed to concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  investments  trade receivables  and short term foreign exchange forward contracts 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with the company s primary bank  a major financial institution  with a high quality credit rating 
the company s investments consist of money market funds  municipal government agencies and tax free bonds or investment grade securities 
the short term foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into with its primary bank
