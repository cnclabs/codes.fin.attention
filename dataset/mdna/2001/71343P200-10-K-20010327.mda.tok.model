item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating results compared with due to the transaction with the former pepsiamericas  inc completed in november and the transaction with pepsico completed in may  the company believes that pro forma results provide a better indication of current operating trends than reported results 
therefore  included within the following discussion are explanations of both reported results and the pro forma results 
pro forma operating results assume the acquisitions and divestitures  with the exception of trinidad and tobago  as well as any related transactions  completed in and occurred at the beginning of pro forma operating results also exclude the impact of special charges and other non recurring items recorded in either year 
net sales net sales for and were as follows in millions reported pro forma unaudited percent percent change change domestic     international total sales     on a reported basis  net sales increased by million  or percent  in compared with  primarily reflecting sales contributed by the additional territories acquired in the transactions with the former pepsiamericas and pepsico  as well as the acquisition of toma in december the balance of the growth in net sales reflected improved pricing in the domestic markets offset by a decline in volume 
on a pro forma basis  net sales increased by million  or percent 
the growth in net sales includes an increase in domestic sales of million and an increase in international sales of million 
the increase in domestic sales resulted from improved pricing  up nearly five percent  offset by a decline in volume  down percent for the full year 
despite the decline in volume  principally the result of volume declines in trademark pepsi products  aquafina volume grew nearly percent and lemon lime volume growth was bolstered by the introduction of sierra mist 
the higher international sales resulted from improved volume  up percent  offset by a decline in net pricing  down percent 
the lower net pricing in international is indicative of the currency devaluation impact in the central european territories 
the impact of currency devaluation is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately million in compared with the previous year 
gross profit the consolidated gross profit margin on a reported basis decreased to percent of sales in compared with percent of sales in the domestic gross profit margin was essentially unchanged  while the international gross profit margin declined due to the inclusion of lower margin toma products for the entire year in compared with only one month in and the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency 
a portion of the product costs in the international operations is fixed in us dollars and therefore was not favorably affected by currency devaluation 
the consolidated gross profit margin on a pro forma basis decreased to percent of sales in compared with percent in the domestic gross profit margin improved slightly  while the international gross profit margin declined by percentage points 
the decline in the international gross profit margin is due to a portion of the product costs in the international operations being fixed in us dollars as discussed previously

on a reported basis  toma was included for only one month in due to the acquisition being completed on december  on a pro forma basis  sd a expenses as a percent of sales were percent compared with percent in the basis point improvement was primarily the result of the benefits from currency devaluation experienced in central europe  which resulted in lower expenses as reported in us dollars

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
commodity prices the risk from commodity price changes correlates to the company s ability to recover higher product costs through price increases to customers  which may be limited due to the competitive pricing environment that exists in the soft drink business 
in  the company began to use swap contracts to hedge price fluctuations for a portion of its aluminum requirements 
each contract hedges price fluctuations on a portion of the company s aluminum can requirements over a specified period of time 
because of the high correlation between aluminum commodity prices and the company s contractual cost of aluminum cans  the company considers these hedges to be highly effective 
as of fiscal year end  the company has hedged a portion of its future aluminum requirements 
interest rates during  the risk from changes in interest rates was not material to the company s operations because a significant portion of the company s debt issues were fixed rate obligations 
the company s floating rate exposure relates to changes in the six month libor rate and the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of fiscal year end  including the impact of additional fixed rate debt issued in february  a basis point change in each of these rates would have an impact of approximately million on the company s annual interest expense related to its floating rate obligations 
the company has from time to time used interest rate swaps and forward contracts to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt and to lock interest rates on debt issues 
in  the company had short term investments throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds and commercial paper  which were most closely tied to the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming a basis points change in the rate of interest associated with the company s short term investments  interest income would not have changed by a significant amount 
currency exchange rates because the company operates in international franchise territories  it is subject to exposure resulting from changes in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation  growth  interest rates and governmental actions  as well as other factors 
the company currently does not hedge the translation risks of investments in its international operations 
any positive cash flows generated have been reinvested in the operations  excluding repayments of intercompany loans from the manufacturing operations in poland 
non us operations are expected to represent about percent of the company s total operations in and represented about percent in changes in currency exchange rates impact the translation of the results of the international operations from their local currencies into us dollars 
if the currency exchange rates had changed by five percent in  the company estimates the impact on reported operating income would have been approximately million 
this estimate does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains in one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category
