general product profitability 
margins on life insurance and annuity products are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
rising interest rates would result in a decline in the market value of assets 
however  as there are positive cash flows from renewal premiums  investment income and maturities of existing assets  the need for early disposition of investment assets to meet operating cash flow requirements would be unlikely 
rising interest rates would also result in available cash flows from maturities being invested at higher interest rates  which would help support a gradual increase in new business and renewal interest rates on interest sensitive products 
a sharp  sudden rise in the interest rate environment without a concurrent increase in crediting rates could result in higher surrenders  particularly for annuities 
the effect of such surrenders would be to reduce earnings over the long term 
earnings in the period of the surrender could increase or decrease depending on whether surrender charges were applicable and whether such charges differed from the write off of related deferred acquisition costs or present value of future profits 
when interest rates fall  smc generally attempts to adjust the credited interest rates subject to competitive pressures 
although smc believes that such strategies will continue to permit it to achieve a positive spread  a significant decline in the yield on smc s investments could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of smc 
the long term profitability of insurance products depends on the accuracy of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such insurance products  and the ultimate profitability of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii mortality  iii return on cash invested by the insurer during the life of the policy  and iv expenses of acquiring and administering the policies 
the average expected remaining life of standard life s traditional life and annuity business in force at december  was years 
this calculation was determined based upon smc s actuarial models and assumptions as to expected persistency and mortality 
persistency is the extent to which insurance policies sold are maintained by the insured 
the persistency of life insurance and annuity products is a critical element of their profitability 
however  a surrender charge often applies in the early contract years and declines to zero over time 
policyholders sometimes do not pay premiums  thus causing their policies to lapse 
for the years  and standard life experienced total policy lapses of  and of total policies in force at december of each year  respectively 
the american council of life insurance fact book reported industry life insurance voluntary termination rates in of for policies in force less than two years  for policies in force for two years or more and for all policies in force 
present value of future profits 
in accordance with industry practice  when smc purchases additional insurance business  it assigns a portion of the purchase price  called the present value of future profits  to the right to receive future cash flows arising from existing insurance policies 
this asset is recorded when the business is purchased at the value of projected future cash flows on existing policies  less a discount to present value 
as future cash flows emerge  they are treated as a recovery of this asset 
therefore  if cash flows emerging from the purchased or recaptured business during a period exactly equal the projections  they are offset by that period s amortization of the cost of the policies purchased 
in that event  the only income statement effect from the purchased business is the realization of the discount that was initially deducted from the asset to reflect its present value 
changes in the future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on the results of operations  because the amount of amortization is expected to be equal to the profits emerging from the purchased policies  net of interest on the unrecovered present value of future profits balance 
this asset is amortized over the expected life of the related policies purchased 
present value of future profits is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
in selecting the interest rate to calculate the discounted present value of the projected future profits  smc uses the risk rate of return it needs to earn in order to invest in the business being acquired or recaptured 
in determining this required risk rate of return  smc considers the following factors the magnitude of the risks associated with each of the actuarial assumptions used in determining expected future cash flows as described above 
the cost of the capital required to fund the acquisition or recapture 
the likelihood of changes in projected future cash flows that might occur if there are changes in insurance regulations and tax laws 
the acquired company s compatibility with other smc activities that may favorably affect future cash flows 
the complexity of the acquired company or recaptured business 
recent prices ie  discount rates used in determining valuations paid by others to acquire or recapture similar blocks of business 
the discount rate selected may affect subsequent earnings in those instances where the purchase price of the policies exceeds the value of net assets acquired including the value of future profits discounted at the selected interest rate 
selection of a lower or higher discount rate will increase or decrease the portion of the purchase price assigned to the present value of future cash flows and will result in an offsetting decrease or increase in the amount of the purchase price assigned to goodwill 
the effect on subsequent earnings caused by this variation in purchase price allocation will depend on the characteristics of the policies purchased 
use of a lower rate may result in an increase in reported earnings in the early years after an acquisition followed by a decrease in earnings in later years 
the percentage of future expected net amortization of the beginning balance of the present value of future profits before the effect of net unrealized gains and losses  based on the present value of future profits at december  and current assumptions as to future events on all policies in force  are expected to be between and in each of the years through smc used discount rates of and to calculate the present value of future profits of the savers life and midwestern life acquisitions  respectively 
each is being amortized over years based on the mix of their respective annuity and life business 
for more information related to present value of future profits refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred acquisition costs 
insurance products generate two types of profit streams i from the excess of investment income earned over that credited to the policyholder and ii from the excess of premiums received over costs incurred for policy issuance  administration and mortality 
costs incurred in issuing new policies are deferred and recorded as deferred acquisition costs dac  which are amortized using present value techniques so that profits are realized in proportion to premium revenue for certain products and estimated gross profits for certain other products 
profits from all of these elements are recognized over the lives of the policies  no profits are recorded at the time the policies are issued 
amortization of dac related to operations was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from increased amortization of dac as gross profits from business sold in recent years began to emerge 
dac is generally amortized over the expected lives of the policies  a period of approximately years 
interest is being accumulated at the projected crediting rate on the policies 
dac is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
the offset to these amounts is recorded directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes 
future expected amortization of dac for the next five years before the effect of net realized and unrealized gains and losses  based on dac at december  and current assumptions  is as follows in thousands gross amortization  interest accumulation      net amortization     the amounts included in the foregoing table do not include any amortization of dac resulting from the sale of new products after december  any changes in future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on results of operations because the amount of amortization is expected to be proportionate to the profits from the produced policies  net of interest on dac 
variances between actual and expected profits 
actual experience on purchased and produced insurance may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums collected  investment spreads  mortality costs  persistency  administrative costs and other factors 
variances from original projections  whether positive or negative  are included in net income as they occur 
to the extent that these variances indicate that future experience will differ from the estimated profits reflected in the capitalization and amortization of the cost of policies purchased or the cost of policies produced  current and future amortization rates may be adjusted 
accounting for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life products 
the company primarily accounts for its annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
under sfas no 
a benefit reserve is established at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received 
thereafter  the benefit reserve is adjusted for any additional deposits  interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals 
revenues for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life policies  other than certain non interest sensitive annuities  consist of policy charges for surrenders and partial withdrawals  mortality and administration  and investment income earned 
these revenues do not include the annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits 
expenses related to these products include interest credited to policyowner account balances  operating costs for policy administration  amortization of dac and mortality costs in excess of account balances 
costs relating to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses  approximately of initial annuity premium deposits and of premiums from universal and interest sensitive life products for smc  are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
accounting for unit linked products 
separate account assets and liabilities are maintained primarily for contracts of which the majority represents unit linked products where benefits on surrender and maturity are not guaranteed 
they generally represent funds held in accounts to meet specific investment objectives of policyholders who bear the investment risk 
investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to these policyholders 
smc earns income from the investment management fee it charges on these unit linked contracts  which ranges from 
to of the value of the underlying separate accounts

benefits and claims include i paid life insurance claims  ii benefits from annuity policies that incorporate significant mortality features and  iii changes in future policy reserves 
throughout the company s history  it has experienced both periods of higher and lower benefit claims 
such volatility is not uncommon in the life insurance industry and  over extended periods of time  periods of higher claim experience tend to offset periods of lower claim experience

interest expense and financing costs represent interest expense incurred and the amortization of related debt issuance costs 
in interest expense and financing costs remained at million 
average borrowings for the period declined million  however  they were offset by an increased interest rate for the period 
in interest expense and financing costs increased 
million or  to million primarily due to increased average borrowings for the period of approximately million and an increase in the average interest rate for the period on the revolving line of credit 
net realized investment gains losses  net of related amortization fluctuate from period to period and generally arise when securities are sold in response to changes in the investment environment which provide opportunities to maximize return on the investment portfolio without adversely affecting the quality and overall yield 
realized investment gains losses can affect the timing of the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the amortization of the present value of future profits 
net realized investment losses  net of related costs and amortization  for were million  which is reduced by million of deferred acquisition cost amortization 
approximately of the gross losses for are related to fixed maturity securities that have a decline in fair value that is considered other than temporary 
these securities are considered to be in substantive default ie default as to interest and principal

liquidity of insurance operations us insurance operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of standard life are its contractual obligations to policyholders  dividend  rent  management fee and surplus debenture interest payments to standard management and other operating expenses 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from premium income  net investment income  investment sales and maturities and sales of fpda s and equity indexed products 
these sources of liquidity for standard life significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits and policy withdrawals and surrenders 
the amount of withdrawals and surrenders is affected by a variety of factors such as renewal interest crediting rates  interest rates for competing products  general economic conditions  standard life s am best ratings currently rated b and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
the policies and annuities issued by standard life contain provisions that allow policyholders to withdraw or surrender their policies under defined circumstances 
these policies and annuities generally contain provisions  which apply penalties or otherwise restrict the ability of policyholders to make such withdrawals or surrenders 
standard life closely monitors the surrender and policy loan activity of its insurance products and manages the composition of its investment portfolios  including liquidity  to ensure it has sufficient cash resources in light of such activity 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and other withdrawals 
in addition to the potential effect on liquidity  unanticipated withdrawals in a changing interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if smc were required to sell investments at reduced values to meet liquidity demands 
smc manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings effect of changing market interest rates 
smc seeks assets that have duration characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
smc also prepares cash flow projections and performs cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
smc s us insurance subsidiaries currently expect available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be adequate to meet the demand for funds 
statutory surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the naic  as modified by the idoi  or the state in which the insurance subsidiaries do business 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to reflect a more conservative perspective 
with respect to new business  statutory accounting practices require that i acquisition costs primarily commissions and policy issue costs and ii reserves for future guaranteed principal payments and interest in excess of statutory rates  be expensed in the year the new business is written 
these items cause a reduction in statutory surplus surplus strain in the year written for many insurance products 
smc designs its products to minimize such first year losses  but certain products continue to cause a statutory loss in the year written 
for each product  smc controls the amount of net new premiums written to manage the effect of such surplus strain 
smc s long term growth goals contemplate continued growth in its insurance businesses 
to achieve these growth goals  smc s us insurance subsidiaries will need to increase statutory surplus 
additional statutory surplus may be secured through various sources such as internally generated statutory earnings  infusions by standard management with funds generated through debt or equity offerings or mergers with other life insurance companies 
if additional capital is not available from one or more of these sources  smc believes that it could reduce surplus strain through the use of reinsurance or through reduced writing of new business 
management believes that the operational cash flow of standard life will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for as of december   standard life had statutory capital and surplus for regulatory purposes of million compared to million at december  as the life insurance and annuity business produced by standard life increases  standard life expects to continue to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements through statutory profits and through additional capital contributions by standard management 
net cash flow from operations on a statutory basis of standard life  after payment of benefits and operating expenses  was million and million for and  respectively 
if the need arises for cash  which is not readily available  additional liquidity could be obtained from the sale of invested assets

smi dividends are limited to its accumulated earnings without regulatory approval 
smi and premier life luxembourg were not permitted to pay dividends in and due to accumulated losses 
premier life bermuda paid a dividend of 
million in and 
million in to smi and no dividends in smc does not anticipate dividends from smi in factors that may affect future results smc is subject to a number of factors affecting its business  including intense competition in the industry and the ability to attract and retain agents and employees 
if smc is unable to respond appropriately to any of these factors  business and financial results could suffer 
smc s operating results are affected by many factors  including  competition  lapse rates  interest rates  maintenance of insurance ratings  governmental regulation and general business conditions  many of which are outside its control 
smc operates in a highly competitive environment and is in direct competition with a large number of insurance companies  many of which offer a greater number of products through a greater number of agents and have greater resources 
in addition  smc may be subject  from time to time  to new competition resulting from additional private insurance carriers introducing products similar to those offered by smc 
moreover  as a result of recent federal legislation  commercial banks  insurance companies  and investment banks may now combine  provided certain requirements are satisfied  and smc expects to encounter increased competition from these providers of financial services 
this competitive environment could result in lower premiums  loss of sales and reduced profitability 
smc s management believes that the ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  the ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market products and the ability to develop competitive products that also are profitable 
although management believes that good relationships with our independent general agents exist  competition for those agents among insurance companies is intense 
smc s independent general agents typically represent other insurance companies and may sell products that compete with our products 
see business of smc competition 
smc s success also depends upon the continued contributions of key officers and employees 
should one or more of these individuals leave or otherwise become unavailable to us for any reason  business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see business of smc employees 
smc s success depends on the performance of others 
smc s results may be affected by the performance of others because of entering into various arrangements involving other parties 
for instance  many products are sold through independent distribution channels and arise from arrangements with unrelated marketing organizations 
as with all financial services companies  the ability to conduct business is dependent upon consumer confidence in the industry and its products 
actions of competitors  and financial difficulties of other companies in the industry  could undermine consumer confidence and adversely affect business results 
financial results could suffer if our am best ratings are downgraded 
insurers compete with other insurance companies  financial intermediaries and other institutions on the basis of a number of factors  including the ratings assigned by am best 
standard life and dixie life have a rating of b and b  respectively  by am best 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved very good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best  and have a good ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best 
according to am best  these companies generally have an adequate ability to meet their obligations to policyholders  but their financial strength is vulnerable to unfavorable changes in underwriting or economic conditions 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves  and the experience and competence of its management 
am best reviews its ratings of insurance companies from time to time 
if the am best ratings were downgraded  sales of annuity products and life insurance policies could be significantly impacted and the financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see business of smc competition 
a tax law change could adversely affect smc s ability to compete with non insurance products 
under the united states internal revenue code  income tax payable by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation period of certain life insurance and annuity products 
this favorable tax treatment may give certain products a competitive advantage over other non insurance products 
to the extent that the internal revenue code is revised to reduce the tax deferred status of life insurance and annuity products  or to increase the tax deferred status of competing products  all life insurance companies  including smc  would be adversely affected with respect to their ability to sell these products  and  depending on grandfathering provisions  the surrenders of existing annuity contracts and life insurance policies 
in addition  life insurance products are often used to fund estate tax obligations 
if the estate tax were eliminated or significantly reduced  the demand for certain life insurance products could be adversely affected 
smc cannot predict what tax initiatives may be enacted which could have an adverse affect on its business 
interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect spread income 
significant changes in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the credited interest rates paid on outstanding policies 
both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect spread income 
although smc develops and maintains asset liability management programs and procedures designed to preserve spread income in rising or falling interest rate environments  changes in interest rates could adversely affect these spreads 
financial results could suffer if the value of investments decreases due to factors beyond smc s control 
smc s invested assets are subject to customary risks of credit defaults and changes in market values 
the value of the company s investment portfolio depends in part on the financial condition of the companies in which it has made investments 
factors that my affect the overall market value of invested assets include interest rate levels  financial market performance  and general economic conditions  as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses of individual companies 
smc s reinsurance program is subject to the financial failure of the reinsurer and to market conditions which affect the amount and cost of reinsurance 
if a large number of smc s reinsurers fail or market conditions make it more difficult to reinsure profitably  smc financial results could suffer 
smc is able to assume insurance risks beyond the level which capital and surplus would support by transferring substantial portions of risks to other  larger insurers through reinsurance contracts 
these reinsurance arrangements  which are the usual practice in the insurance industry  leave exposure to credit risk which exists because reinsurance does not fully relieve smc of liability to insureds for the portion of the risks ceded to reinsurers 
although smc places reinsurance with reinsurers it believes to be financially stable  a reinsurer s subsequent insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty could have a materially adverse effect on smc s financial condition 
policy claims fluctuate from year to year  and future benefit payments may exceed reserves  which may cause financial results to suffer 
financial results may fluctuate from year to year due to fluctuations in policy claims received by subsidiaries 
reserves are established for claims and future policy benefits based on accepted actuarial practices 
by care in underwriting new policies and sharing risk with reinsurance companies  smc has attempted to limit the risk that actual payments for death and other benefits will exceed its reserves 
the reserves are  however  only actuarial estimates and it is possible that smc s claims experience could be worse than anticipated  so that reserves may prove to be insufficient 
if this were to happen  it could result in a decline in operating earnings 
smc could be forced to sell illiquid investments at a loss to cover policyholder withdrawals 
many products allow policyholders and contract holders to withdraw their funds under defined circumstances 
smc manages its liabilities and configures its investment portfolio to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands  contract benefits and maturities 
while a significant amount of liquid assets are owned  certain portions of assets are relatively illiquid 
unanticipated withdrawal or surrender activity could  under some circumstances  compel smc to dispose of illiquid assets on unfavorable terms  which could have an adverse effect 
because a significant portion of smc s annuity contracts are surrenderable  any substantial increase in the level of surrenders could negatively affect financial results 
as of february   approximately or million of annuity contracts in force measured by statutory reserves were surrenderable 
approximately of those contracts or approximately million of annuity contracts in force measured by statutory reserves are surrenderable without charge 
changes in prevailing interest rates  ratings or other factors which result in or lead to significant levels of surrenders of existing annuity contracts could have a material adverse effect upon smc s financial condition and results of operations 
surrenders result in a reduction of invested assets that earn investment income and a reduction of policyholder account balances that credit interest

a stock price decline may limit the ability to raise capital or consummate acquisitions 
during and  many financial services companies  including smc  experienced a decrease in the market price of their common stock 
although management believes that smc has sufficient  internally generated cash flow to fund its day to day operations  a lower stock price may limit the ability to raise capital to fund other growth opportunities and acquisitions 
smc s business strategy has in the past and might in the future include the acquisition of other businesses 
smc may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or properly integrate their businesses 
from time to time  acquisitions of other businesses may be considered 
competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities  may lead to higher acquisition prices 
also  smc may not be able to identify  acquire or manage additional businesses profitably or to successfully integrate the acquired businesses 
businesses acquired may have liabilities that smc underestimated or did not discover during pre acquisition investigations 
some of the liabilities of the businesses acquired  even if not expressly assumed  may be imposed on smc as the successor to the business 
further  each acquisition involves a number of other special risks that could cause the acquired business to fail to meet expectations 
for example the acquired business may not achieve expected results  key personnel of the acquired business may not be retained  substantial  unanticipated costs  delays or other operational financial problems may be incurred when the business is integrated with smc  management s attention may be diverted  or management may not be able to manage the combined entity effectively or to make acquisitions and grow our business internally at the same time 
the timing  size or success of any future acquisitions cannot be predicted  nor the ability to integrate any acquired businesses  or their associated capital requirements 
in addition  smc may not be able to obtain acquisition financing when required  or such financing may only be available on terms and conditions that are unacceptable 
smc s failure to address the above issues  could cause financial results to suffer 
mergers  acquisitions and consolidations 
the us insurance industry is experiencing an increasing number of mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of certain business lines 
these consolidations are largely the result of the following the need to reduce costs of distribution and overhead  the need to maintain business in force  increased competition  regulatory capital requirements  and technology costs 
smc expects this trend to continue 
foreign currency risk 
smi policyholders invest in assets denominated in a wide range of currencies 
as policyholders are not permitted to invest directly in options  futures and derivatives  their investment and currency risk is limited to premiums they have paid 
although policyholders effectively bear the currency risk  smi could be exposed to currency fluctuations if currencies within the conventional investment portfolio or certain actuarial reserves are mismatched 
in order to minimize this risk  smi continually matches the assets and liabilities of the portfolio and the reserves 
in addition  premier life s luxembourg shareholder s equity is denominated in luxembourg francs 
premier life luxembourg does not hedge currency risk because its shareholder s equity will remain in luxembourg francs for the foreseeable future  thus  no significant realized foreign exchange gains or losses are anticipated 
at december   there was a million unrealized loss from foreign currency translation 
euro currency 
effective january   eleven participating european member union countries established fixed conversion rates between their legal currencies and the euro 
the legal currencies in those countries will continue to be used as legal tender through june  subsequent to this date  the legal currencies will be canceled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
during this three year dual currency environment  conversion rates between the legal currencies will no longer be computed directly between one another 
instead  a special triangulation procedure must be followed by first converting one legal currency into its euro equivalent and then converting the euro equivalent into the other legal currency 
although the company has not initiated an analysis plan for the euro conversion  smc does not expect it to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition 
possibility of future dilution of ownership and voting power 
the smc board of directors has the authority to issue up to 
million additional shares of preferred stock and million additional shares of common stock 
the board s authority under smc s charter typically does not require stockholder approval unless it is otherwise required for a particular transaction 
although smc is not currently involved in any life insurance acquisitions  the company regularly investigates such opportunities and could issue additional shares of smc common or preferred stock in connection with an acquisition 
uncertainties regarding intangible assets 
included in smc s december  financial statements are certain assets that are primarily valued  for financial statement purposes  on the basis of management assumptions 
these assets include items such as deferred acquisition costs  present value of future profits  costs in excess of net assets acquired  and organization and deferred debt issuance costs 
the value of these assets reflected in the december  balance sheet total million or of smc s assets 
smc has established procedures to periodically review the assumptions used to value these assets and determine the need to make adjustments of such values in smc s consolidated financial statements 
smc has determined that the assumptions used in the initial valuation of the assets are consistent with the current operations of smc as of december  regulatory environment 
currently  prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic has completed the process of codifying sap to promote standardization of methods utilized throughout the industry 
completion of this project might result in changes in statutory accounting practices for smc s insurance subsidiaries  however  it is not expected that such changes would materially affect smc s insurance subsidiaries statutory capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that existing insurance related laws and regulations will not become more restrictive in the future and  therefore  it is not possible to predict the potential effects that any proposed or future legislation may have on the financial condition or operations of the company

financial services deregulation 
the us congress is currently considering a number of legislative proposals intended to reduce or eliminate restrictions on affiliations among financial services organizations 
the recently passed glb act would allow banks to own or affiliate with insurers and securities firms 
an increased presence of banks in the life insurance and annuity businesses may increase competition in these markets 
the company cannot predict the impact of these proposals on the earnings of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to invest available funds in a manner that will maximize shareholder value and fund future obligations to policyholders and debtors  subject to appropriate risk considerations 
many of the company s products incorporate surrender charges  market interest rate adjustments or other features to encourage persistency 
approximately of the total insurance liabilities at december  had surrender penalties or other restrictions and approximately are not subject to surrender 
the company also seeks to maximize the total return on its investments through active investment management 
accordingly  the company has determined that the entire portfolio of fixed maturity securities is available to be sold in response to i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in relative values of individual securities and asset sectors  iii changes in prepayment risks  iv changes in credit quality outlook for certain securities  v liquidity needs  and vi other factors 
profitability of many of the company s products is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
although substantially all credited rates on annuity products may be changed annually subject to minimum guaranteed rates  changes in competition and other factors  including the impact of the level of surrenders and withdrawals  may limit the ability to adjust or to maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions 
as of december   the average yield  computed on the cost basis of the investment portfolio  was  and the average interest rate credited or accruing to total insurance liabilities was  excluding guaranteed interest bonuses for the first year of the annuity contract 
computer models were used to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from the company s existing business under various interest rate scenarios 
these simulations measured the potential gain or loss in fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
with such estimates  the company seeks to closely match the duration of assets to the duration of liabilities 
when the estimated duration of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
at december   the option adjusted duration of fixed maturity securities and short term investments were approximately  and the option adjusted duration of insurance liabilities was approximately if interest rates were to increase by from their december  levels  the company s fixed maturity securities and short term investments net of the corresponding changes in the values of cost of policies purchased  cost of policies produced and insurance liabilities would decline in fair value by approximately million 
the calculations involved in the company s computer simulations incorporate numerous assumptions  require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any management of the investment portfolio in reaction to such change 
consequently  potential changes in the value of our financial instruments indicated by the simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and the differences may be material 
because the company s investments and liabilities are actively managed  actual losses could be less than those estimated above
