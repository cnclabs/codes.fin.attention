history of operations onyx was founded in february we commercially released version of our flagship product  onyx customer center  in december in our first three years of operation  we focused primarily on research and development activities  recruiting personnel  purchasing operating assets  marketing our products  building a direct sales force and expanding our service business 
our revenues totaled million in and million in in mid  we substantially expanded our operations to capitalize on our opportunity within the rapidly emerging crm market 
we decided  at the potential expense of profitability  to accelerate our investments in research and development  marketing  domestic and international sales channels  professional services and our general and administrative infrastructure 
we believe these investments have been critical to our growth 
our revenues grew to million in  million in and million in nevertheless  these investments have also significantly increased our operating expenses  contributing to the net losses that we incurred in each fiscal quarter from the first quarter of through the second quarter of after achieving profitability in the third and fourth quarters of  we decided to again accelerate our investments in research and development  marketing  domestic and international sales channels  professional services and our general and administrative infrastructure to further capitalize on our opportunity within the crm market 
our revenues grew to million in excluding acquisition related amortization and equity investment losses  after tax net income in totaled million 
including these charges  we incurred a net loss in totaling million 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in dollar amount for the foreseeable future as we expand our product development  sales and marketing and professional services staff and  as a result  we may incur operating losses in future quarters 
source of revenues and revenue recognition policy we generate revenues from sales of software licenses and services 
we receive software license revenues from licensing our products directly to end users and asps and indirectly through vars 
to a lesser extent  we receive software license revenues from third party products that we distribute 
we receive service revenues from sales of post contract support  consulting and training services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly from us or indirectly through vars 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of software if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and upgrades  or consulting services 
if a nonstandard acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
our agreements with our customers and vars do not contain product return rights 
we recognize revenues from customer support services ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
we derive consulting revenues primarily from implementation services performed on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements related to the installation of our software products 
we recognize revenues from consulting and training services as these services are performed 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  we recognize license fee revenue on shipment of the software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and the payment terms for licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria impacted by the services 
in cases where license fee payments are contingent on the acceptance of services  we defer recognition of revenues from both the license and the service elements until the acceptance criteria are met

we also issued an additional million  shares of common stock on october  and are obligated to issue an additional million of common stock on october  these shares of onyx common stock will be valued based on the trading prices of onyx common stock on the nasdaq national market on the three trading days immediately prior to issuance 
the issuance of these shares will dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in onyx

we are also obligated to pay an additional million in either cash or common stock  at our election  at any time between march  and april  if we pay the additional million in common stock  the issuance will dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in onyx 
we will record million for the value allocated to deferred stock compensation  which represents the excess of the fair value over the exercise price for the options assumed by onyx 
the acquisition  including  of acquisition related costs  was valued at approximately million 
the net purchase price  adjusted for deferred stock compensation  was approximately million 
the value of the deferred compensation will be amortized over the remaining stock options vesting periods of years using a graded vesting approach 
we will account for the transaction using the purchase method  and  accordingly  the results of revenuelab s operations will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we currently estimate the purchase price allocation to include  for the fair value of net assets acquired plus million for goodwill and other intangibles  which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years on a straight line basis

we have a controlling interest in onyx japan  therefore  onyx japan has been included in our consolidated financial statements 
the minority shareholders interest in onyx japan s earnings or losses is accounted for in the statement of operations 
results of operations we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful basis to predict our future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
however  we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
in addition  although we have experienced significant revenue growth recently  and achieved profitability in the third and fourth quarters of  this revenue growth may not continue  and we may not maintain profitability in the future 
our future operating results will depend on many factors  including 
market acceptance of our products  
our ability to compete in the highly competitive e business systems market  
continued purchases by our existing customers  including additional license and maintenance revenues  
our ability to successfully expand our international operations  
our ability to expand our sales and support infrastructure  
our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  
our ability to enable our products to operate on multiple platforms  
variability in the mix of our license versus service revenues  the mix of our direct versus indirect license revenues and the mix of services that we perform versus those performed by third party service providers  
the cost and financial accounting effects of any acquisitions of companies or complementary technologies that we may complete  
the loss of any key technical  sales  customer support or management personnel and the timing of any new hires  
the timing of customer orders  which can be affected by customer ordering and budgeting cycles or by customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  and 
general economic conditions  which may affect our customers capital investment levels in management information systems

revenues from indirect sales channels increased from million in to million in  and to million in the increases in our indirect revenues resulted primarily from the increased number of vars we added domestically and internationally over the periods

consulting  customer support and training employees increased from as of december  to as of december   and to as of december  cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of related support and service revenues was in  in and in the cost of services as a percentage of support and service revenues may vary between periods primarily for two reasons 
the mix of services we provide consulting  customer support  training  which have different cost structures  and 
the resources we use to deliver these services internal versus third parties 
the decrease in cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of related support and service revenues from to the percentages in and reflects primarily a lower percentage use of third party service providers  which contribute significantly lower margins than internal resources  and increased customer support revenues  which contribute higher margins than the other services 
costs and expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  travel and promotional expenses and facility and communication costs for direct sales offices 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and to million in  an increase of

to a lesser extent  we have financed our operations through equipment financing and traditional financing arrangements 
in february  we completed our initial public offering and issued  shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of per share  as adjusted to reflect the for split of our common stock effected march  we received approximately million in cash proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of million from cash and cash equivalents held as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents from year end is primarily the result of a million private placement we completed in november and short term marketable securities maturing during the months ended december   which were subsequently reinvested in securities with an original maturity date of days or less 
we have invested our cash in excess of current operating requirements in a portfolio of investment grade securities 
short term marketable securities totaled million at december  the investments have variable and fixed interest rates and maturities of less than one year 
our working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  we have a million working capital revolving line of credit  shared equally by silicon valley bank and comerica bank california  which is secured by our accounts receivable  property and equipment and intellectual property 
this facility allows us to borrow up to the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable or million and bears interest at the bank s prime rate  which was as of december  the facility expires in august the agreement under which the line of credit was established requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility  however  there was approximately million in standby letters of credit outstanding in connection with our facilities  of which million represents a security deposit for tenant improvements and rent associated with our new corporate headquarters 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility as of december  our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in  million in and  in the operating cash outflows were primarily the result of our operating loss and increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenues 
investing activities provided cash of  in  due primarily to proceeds from the maturity of securities offset by cash used to acquire encyc and the purchase of capital equipment 
investing activities used cash of million in  primarily for the purchase of short term and long term marketable securities following our initial public offering  the acquisition of market solutions and the purchase of capital equipment 
investing activities used cash of million in  due primarily to the purchase of capital equipment and our acquisition of csn offset by the net proceeds from the maturity of short term and long term marketable securities 
the significant increase in capital expenditures in is the combined result of a leasehold improvement  equipment and furniture costs associated with relocating our corporate headquarters  which was completed in july  and  to a lesser extent  b our election to purchase new computer hardware and software used in our operations rather than lease  as we had done historically 
the significant increase in capital expenditures in is the combined result of a leasehold improvement  equipment and furniture costs associated with expanding our field office facilities  b equipment purchases for new personnel and replacement equipment returned under existing operating leases  and c the costs of software and services associated with implementing our new erp system 
financing activities provided cash of million in  due to borrowings under our credit facilities  partially offset by payments on long term obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in due primarily to the proceeds from our initial public offering in february  offset in part by payments on our credit facility and capital lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in due primarily to the proceeds from a private placement to one of our directors in november  the purchase of stock through our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and the investment by minority shareholders in onyx japan offset in part by payments on our long term obligations 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we 
enter new markets for our products and services  
increase research and development spending  
increase sales and marketing activities  
develop new distribution channels  
expand our headquarters and field office facilities and infrastructure  
expand our senior management team  
improve our operational and financial systems  and 
broaden our professional service capabilities 
these operating expenses will consume a material amount of our cash resources 
we may also use a portion of our cash resources to acquire complementary technologies or businesses  however  we currently have no commitments or agreements and are not involved in any negotiations with respect to any transactions of this nature 
on january   we entered into an equity financing arrangement with ramius securities  llc  or ramius securities  and ramius capital group  llc  or ramius capital  under which we may from time to time in the next two years elect to have ramius securities sell a limited number of shares of our common stock on a best efforts basis or to have ramius capital purchase those shares if the selling efforts are unsuccessful 
the obligations of ramius securities and ramius capital under this arrangement are subject to a number of conditions and limitations  and the amount of common stock that we may sell depends on the daily trading volumes of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
as a result  we may be unable to sell our common stock under this facility in the amount and at the times we want 
in addition  the terms of the equity financing arrangement have not been reviewed or approved by the national association of securities dealers  or nasd 
nasd review is pending and no securities will be offered under the arrangement unless and until nasd approval is obtained 
any sales under the facility will be made under our shelf registration statement on form s  filed with the sec in november in connection with the financing arrangements  we issued ramius securities a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
this warrant is fully exercisable and expires on january  the facility does not preclude us from issuing shares in other transactions should market conditions make those transactions advantageous 
on february   we completed a firm underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share from our million shelf registration statement filed in november we estimate the net proceeds from the offering to be approximately million after deducting the estimated costs associated with the offering 
in addition  we granted dain rauscher wessels  the sole underwriter for the offering  an option to purchase up to  shares of our common stock to cover over allotments  if any 
we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for design and construction of tenant improvements in our new corporate headquarters  expansion of our field office facilities  additional working capital and other general corporate purposes  as well as the possible acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products and technologies 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  investments  available bank borrowings and our arrangement with ramius capital and ramius securities will be sufficient to meet our capital and requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may seek additional funds before that time through public or private equity financing or from other sources to fund our operations and pursue our growth strategy 
except for the arrangement with ramius securities and ramius capital  we have no commitment for additional financing  and we may experience difficulty in obtaining additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock and may dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in onyx 
any common stock that we issue under the arrangement with ramius securities and ramius capital  or otherwise  will dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in onyx 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 became effective for us beginning january  and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
interest rate risk we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  which is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of december  foreign currency risk the majority of our sales and expenses are currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses 
while we conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during and expect to continue to do so in the future  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be material to onyx 
although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future
