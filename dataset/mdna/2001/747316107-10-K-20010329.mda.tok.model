the improvement for the year was mainly attributable to metalworking process chemicals sales growth in brazil and the asia pacific region primarily due to strong demand from the steel industry  offset by reductions in the european region due to foreign currency translation and lower coatings segment revenues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in commodity prices 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s long term debt has a fixed interest rate  while its short term debt is negotiated at market rates which can be either fixed or variable 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of short term debt to quaker will increase 
this can have a material adverse effect on quaker depending on the extent of quaker s short term borrowings 
as of december   quaker had  in short term borrowings 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of international business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially adversely affected 
in the past  quaker has used  on a limited basis  forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions and foreign exchange options to reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the amount of any gain or loss on these derivative financial instruments was immaterial  and there are no contracts or options outstanding at december  commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker earnings can be materially adversely affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
quaker has not been  nor is it currently a party to  any derivative financial instrument relative to commodities
