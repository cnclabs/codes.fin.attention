item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview management s discussion and analysis of the results of operation and financial condition of clear channel communications  inc and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
the discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
during the third quarter of  as a result of the acquisitions of amfm inc and sfx entertainment  inc  we redefined our reportable operating segments 
accordingly  all prior years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the new reportable operating segments are radio broadcasting which includes all domestic and international radio assets and radio networks  outdoor advertising which includes domestic and international billboards  transit displays  street furniture and other outdoor advertising media  and live entertainment which includes live music  theatrical  family entertainment and motor sports events 
included in the other segment is television broadcasting  sports representation  our media representation business  katz media  and internet businesses as well as corporate expenses 
we continued our strong financial performance in with record operating growth 
this performance was the result of the strength of our management  the growth characteristics of the industries in which we operate and our financial discipline 
during  we completed several acquisitions that continued our strategic focus on building a national radio platform  filling out our outdoor advertising markets and creating a platform of media and entertainment assets  enabling us to provide a fuller breadth of marketing solutions for our clients 
the most significant transactions are as follows amfm inc 
on august   we completed the merger with amfm 
the amfm assets provided a strategic fit with our radio assets to form a national radio platform  positioning our radio segment to expand its market share 
also  as a result of this merger  we have significant overlap such that we now have radio operations in most every domestic market where we operate outdoor or television assets 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  each share of amfm common stock was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issued in the amfm merger  valuing the merger  based on the average market price of our common stock at the signing of the merger agreement  at billion plus the assumption of amfm s outstanding debt of approximately billion 
additionally  we assumed stock options and common stock warrants with a fair value of billion  which are convertible  subject to applicable vesting  into approximately million shares of our common stock 
we refinanced million of amfm s billion of long term debt at the closing of the merger using our credit facilities 
the amfm merger was accounted for as a purchase with resulting goodwill of approximately billion  which is being amortized over years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of amfm have been included in our financial statements beginning august  sfx entertainment  inc 
we closed the merger with sfx on august  with this acquisition  we are able to capitalize on the natural synergies between live entertainment and radio broadcasting and gain immediate industry leadership 
in addition  the sfx acquisition strategically fits with our other businesses as live entertainment provides our existing clients an additional avenue for reaching their target consumers 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  each share of sfx class a common stock was exchanged for shares of our common stock and each share of sfx class b common stock was exchanged for one share of our common stock 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issued in the sfx merger 
based on the average market price of our common stock at the signing of the merger agreement  the merger was valued at billion plus the assumption of sfx s outstanding debt of approximately billion 
additionally  we assumed all stock options and common stock warrants with a fair value of million  which are exercisable for approximately million shares of our common stock 
we refinanced million of sfx s billion of long term debt at the closing of the merger using our credit facilities 
this merger has been accounted for as a purchase with resulting goodwill of approximately billion  which is being amortized over years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of sfx have been included in our financial statements beginning august  a number of lawsuits were filed by holders of sfx class a common stock alleging  among other things  that the difference in consideration for the class a and class b shares constituted unfair consideration to the class b holders  that the sfx board breached its fiduciary duties and that we aided and abetted the actions of the sfx board 
on september   we issued approximately 
million shares of our common stock  valued at million  as settlement of these lawsuits and have included the value of these shares as part of the purchase price 
donrey media group on september   we completed the acquisition of the assets of donrey media group for million in cash consideration 
the donrey acquisition added ten additional markets to our outdoor advertising business  including las vegas  nevada  albuquerque  new mexico  columbus  ohio  oklahoma city  oklahoma  tulsa  oklahoma  little rock  arkansas  fort smith  arkansas  and wichita  kansas 
donrey added markets that benefit our customers trying to target these growing areas with our extensive sales network 
we funded the acquisition with advances on our credit facilities 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  with resulting goodwill of approximately million  which is being amortized over years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of the donrey markets have been included in our financial statements beginning september  ackerley s south florida outdoor advertising division on january   we closed the acquisition of ackerley s south florida outdoor advertising division for million 
ackerley complements the existing outdoor and radio assets we have in south florida 
we funded the acquisition with advances on our credit facilities 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  with resulting goodwill of approximately million  which is amortized over years on a straight line basis 
the results of operations of ackerley have been included in our financial statements beginning january  results of operations we evaluate the operating performance of our businesses using several measures  one of them being ebitda defined as net revenue less operating and corporate expenses 
ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across our business segments  as well as in comparison to other companies  of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation and amortization recognized in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
we have used the purchase method of accounting for all mergers and acquisitions in the history of our company 
non cash depreciation and amortization is significant due to the consolidation in our industry 
while we and many in the financial community consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such as operating income and net income 
we measure the performance of our operating segments and managers based on a like period pro forma measurement 
like period pro forma includes adjustments to the prior period for all acquisitions 
for each acquisition other than the amfm merger  an adjustment was made to the prior period to include the operating results of the acquisition for the corresponding period of time that the acquisition was owned in the current period 
due to the significance of the amfm merger  its results of operations are included in both and for the twelve month period 
results of operations from divested assets are excluded from all periods presented 
we believe that like period pro forma is the best measure of our operating performance as it includes the performance of assets for the period of time we managed the assets 
like period pro forma is compared in constant us dollars us a currency exchange adjustment is made to the actual results to present foreign revenues and expenses in dollars allowing for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements 
we also include our proportionate share of the results of operations of actively managed equity investments in the like period pro forma 
these investments include australian radio network  new zealand radio network  grupo acir  and white horse media and other less significant investments 
the following tables set forth our consolidated and segment results of operations on both a reported and a like period pro forma basis 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated in thousands reported basis years ended december  change v 
net revenue   operating expenses   corporate expenses   ebitda   pro forma basis years ended december  change v

included in our fiscal year reported basis amounts are the net revenues and operating expenses for a twelve month period from our acquisitions  the most significant being jacor communications in may and dame media inc and dauphin ota in july also included in our fiscal year reported basis amounts are the net revenues and operating expenses of our acquisitions for the time period that we operated them in fiscal year our acquisitions included ackerley in january  sfx in august  amfm in august  and donrey in september corporate expenses increased on a reported basis due to the above acquisitions and some duplication of efforts at the corporate level due to the integration of amfm into clear channel 
on a pro forma basis  net revenues increased in fiscal year due to higher advertising rates in our radio and outdoor businesses as well as increased inventory demand within the advertising industry 
the increase in the number of live entertainment events and the number of show dates in fiscal year also contributed to the increase of net revenue on a pro forma basis 
operating expenses increased on a pro forma basis in fiscal year due primarily to the increase in selling costs related to the increase in net revenue 
corporate expenses increased on a pro forma basis in fiscal year due to additional costs associated with the integration of the numerous acquisitions mentioned above 
other income and expense information non cash compensation expense of million was recorded in fiscal year in the amfm merger  we assumed stock options granted to amfm employees that are now convertible into clear channel stock 
to the extent that these employees options continue to vest  we will recognize non cash compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
vesting dates range from january to april if no employees forfeit their unvested options by leaving the company  we expect to recognize non cash compensation expense of approximately million over the remaining vesting period 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to billion in  a increase 
the increase is due primarily to additional amortization of approximately million for the fcc licenses and goodwill from the amfm acquisition and amortization of approximately million for the goodwill from the sfx acquisition 
the remaining increase is due to additional depreciation and amortization associated with the other less significant acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method as well as the inclusion of a full year of depreciation and amortization associated with acquisitions completed during interest expense was million and million in and  respectively  an increase of million or 
approximately of the increase was due to the overall increase in average amounts of debt outstanding and approximately of the increase was due to increases in libor 
currently  approximately of our debt bears interest rates based upon libor 
during  libor rates increased from at december  to at december the gain on sale of assets related to mergers of million in is primarily due to the sale of stations in connection with governmental directives regarding the amfm merger  which realized a gain of million 
this gain for was partially offset by a loss of million related to the sale of million shares of lamar advertising company that we acquired in the amfm merger  and a net loss of million related to write downs of investments acquired in mergers 
the gain in of million relates to the sale of radio stations as a result of governmental directives related to the jacor merger 
equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates for was million as compared to million for the increase was due to improved operations primarily in our international outdoor equity investments 
other income expense net was an expense of million in as compared to income of million in the additional expense recognized in related primarily to the reimbursements of capital costs within certain operating contracts 
the income amount in includes a million gain on sale of marketable securities 
income tax expense was million in  an increase of or million from income tax expense of million 
the increase is primarily related to the taxes on the gain on sale of assets related to mergers recorded in the provision for income taxes represents federal  state and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes 
the annual effective tax rates of for and for were both adversely affected by amortization of intangibles in excess of amounts that are deductible for tax purposes

during the first part of fiscal year  advertising rates were significantly higher than the prior year as rates reacted to inventory sell outs primarily related to the rapid growth period of the internet industry as well as an overall increase in advertising demand across the industry 
although some of our larger markets continued to enjoy significantly higher rates in the second part of fiscal year  when the internet industry demand slowed  rates in our other markets normalized compared to the prior year 
in addition  our national platform approach to selling advertising to our national clients helped increase our overall rates  especially in our larger markets

on a pro forma basis  net revenues increased due to various factors 
higher rates and improved occupancy in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year increased net revenue for the entire year 
in addition  our national platform approach to selling advertising to our national customers helped increase our overall rates  especially in our larger markets 
high growth rates were primarily achieved internationally in our united kingdom and france markets

v 
net revenue  n a operating expenses  n a ebitda  n a we entered the live entertainment business with our acquisition of sfx in august on a pro forma basis  net revenue increased due to an increase in the number of events and the number of show dates in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year expenses increased on a pro forma basis as numerous contracts with less favorable terms signed by prior management were fulfilled during the five month period after our acquisition 
our future expectation is to have contracts with more favorable terms  resulting in more profitable shows

net revenue   operating expenses   corporate expenses   ebitda   the growth in net revenue and operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisitions of universal outdoor in april of  more group in july  jacor in may and dame media and dauphin in july the acquisitions of jacor and dame media added approximately radio stations and premiere radio networks and contributed of net revenue 
the acquisition of dauphin added approximately  display faces  including joint ventures  and contributed of net revenue 
other income and expense information depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in  a increase  primarily due to the acquisition of the tangible and intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of jacor in may and dauphin and dame media in july as well as the inclusion of a full year s depreciation and amortization expense relating to the acquisitions of universal in april and more group in july interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to higher average interest rates and an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding  which resulted from the above mentioned acquisitions 
equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates increased to million in over million in primarily due to the improvement in the operating results of hispanic broadcasting corporation and grupo acir comunicaciones 
income tax expense increased from million in to million in primarily from the increase in the average effective tax rate from in to in  and the increase in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate increased as a result of the increase in nondeductible amortization expense principally associated with the acquisition of jacor 
net income increased from million in to million in due to a million gain realized during relating to the divestiture of certain stations in connection with governmental directives associated with the jacor merger 
this gain was partially offset by higher interest expense  higher depreciation and amortization and the extraordinary loss related to the early extinguishment of debt acquired in the jacor merger 
radio broadcasting in thousands reported basis years ended december  change v

we also acquired radio stations in markets for million in cash and million in restricted cash 
in the live entertainment segment  we acquired sporting  music and theatrical event promotions  racing promotion  and venue management assets for million in cash 
we intend to continue to pursue businesses that fit our strategic goals 
there are currently no significant acquisitions or mergers pending 
from january  through february   we have acquired radio stations primarily through the use of our restricted cash  outdoor display faces and our live entertainment segment acquired sporting and music event promotions 
capital expenditures capital expenditures in increased from million in to million in overall  capital expenditures increased due to recent acquisitions and the increase in the number of radio stations  billboards and displays owned in as compared to in addition  we incurred capital expenditures related to our new live entertainment segment in that we did not incur in the increase in primarily relates to more spending relating to facility consolidation resulting from our acquisitions  technological upgrades of operating assets  a one time capital expenditure in conjunction with the long term extension of a certain operating contract  and the construction of new revenue producing advertising displays 
in  capital expenditures included non recurring expenditures relating to the implementation of year compliant systems and integration of the jacor stations 
in millions capital expenditures radio outdoor entertainment other total recurring non recurring projects revenue producing our radio capital expenditures in are related primarily to expenditures associated with the consolidation of operations in certain markets in conjunction with acquisitions that are expected to result in improved operating results in such markets

share repurchase in october the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of clear channel common stock in the open market 
as of december   we had purchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  including brokers fees and commissions  which are held in treasury 
commitments and contingencies see note g of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our future minimum lease commitments 
there are various lawsuits and claims pending against us 
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies 
we will continue to accrue additional amounts related to such contingent payments if and when it is determinable that the applicable financial performance targets will be met 
the aggregate of these contingent payments  if performance targets are met  would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
debt maturities the scheduled maturities of our credit facilities through december  are million in  million in  million  million in and billion in our maturities of all long term debt outstanding at december   are million in  billion in  billion in  
billion in  billion in  and billion thereafter 
market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt  including fixed rate debt on which we have entered interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the year s average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively float interest at rates based upon libor on billion of our current fixed rate borrowings 
these agreements expire from september to june the fair value of these agreements at december  was million 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change comprehensive income by million 
in connection with the completion of the amfm merger  clear channel and amfm entered into a consent decree with the department of justice regarding our investment in lamar advertising company 
the consent decree  among other things  required us to sell all of our shares of lamar by december  in accordance with abp  business combinations  our million shares of lamar were recorded at their quoted market price on the closing date of the merger  which was significantly higher than amfm s historical purchase price 
we will be exposed to changes in lamar s market price  which may result in large gains and losses related to this disposition in future periods 
foreign currency we have operations in countries throughout europe  asia  australia and north and south america 
foreign operations are measured in their local currencies except in our hyper inflationary countries in which we operate 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to risk of currency fluctuations throughout europe and asia  we have a natural hedge through borrowings in euros  sterling and other currencies 
this hedge position is reviewed monthly 
we maintain no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations reported a loss of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to foreign currencies would change net loss for the year ended december  by 
million 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in various countries  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change net income for the year ended december  by approximately 
million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement 
statement establishes new rules for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
statement is amended by statement accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and statement accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment to statement  is effective for years beginning after june  we adopted this statement january  had we elected early adoption of statement  total assets and long term debt at december  would have increased by million each 
as part of our adoption of statement on january   we reclassified million shares of our investment in american tower corporation that had been classified as available for sale securities under financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities statement to a trading securities classification 
in accordance with statement and statement  on january   the shares were transferred to a trading classification at their fair market value of million  and an unrealized pretax holding gain of million was recognized in earnings 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab 
the bulletin summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
sab  as amended through june   is required to be implemented in the fourth quarter of accordingly  we have implemented sab in the financial statements filed herewith 
implementation of this statement did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin 
fin provides guidance for issues arising in applying apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
fin applies specifically to new awards  exchanges of awards in a business combination  modification to outstanding awards  and changes in grantee status that occur on or after july   except for the provisions related to repricings and the definition of an employee which apply to awards issued after december  the requirements of fin are consistent with our existing accounting policies 
the financial accounting standards board has proposed new accounting for business combinations that  among other things  would change the accounting for goodwill and other intangibles recorded in business acquisitions as of the date of the new statement 
an important part of the proposed statement is that amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles with indefinite lives would cease for both assets acquired prior to the effective date of the statement and for any new goodwill and other intangibles acquired after the effective date of the statement 
rather than amortizing these assets  goodwill and other intangibles would be reviewed for impairment using a market value approach 
the proposed statement is expected to be finalized in june as our amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles is a significant non cash expense that we currently record  this proposed statement  if finalized in its current form  will have a material impact on our financial statements 
we feel that it is not appropriate to forecast the impact until the proposed statement is finalized 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
ratio the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended december  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented
