qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company maintains operations in the united states  canada  mexico  brazil  belgium  germany  italy  the united kingdom  singapore  venezuela and joint ventures in china  india and taiwan 
in its normal operations the company has market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates 
as a result of the company s global operations  it has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars 
the company s significant us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
the company manages its exposure to its net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing its non us dollar net asset positions 
the company also enters into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps under established policies and guidelines  that enable it to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
the company does not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions  as established policies require that such hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
the company s main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  european euro and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the dollar value of future non us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the company as of august   the company s net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
using this method the company s ebit and cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitor s products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of such potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
the company also has market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   the company has million in interest bearing debt obligations that are subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  the company attempts to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
such a balance in the debt profile is expected to moderate the company s financing cost over time 
if long term corporate interest rates were to drop substantially  the company is limited in its ability to refinance its fixed rate debt 
however  the company does have the ability to change the characteristics of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve its objective of balance 
no such interest rate swaps are outstanding at august  at august   million of the outstanding debt is at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million is at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of the company s total debt at august   is approximately million
