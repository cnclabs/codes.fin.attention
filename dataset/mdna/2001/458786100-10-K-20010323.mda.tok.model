the company reported total segment operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to total segment operating profit of million for the prior year 
automated data systems ads segment sales decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
the decrease in revenue reflects the sale of the segment s amtech transportation systems operations amtech in june and lower sales volume for the company s intermec subsidiary 
average quarterly revenue for amtech was million 
the intermec sales decline was caused primarily by weakness in the direct store delivery dsd market and sales force disruption as the company s intermec subsidiary shifted from a geographic sales orientation to a named account vertical marketing structure 
as a result  intermec did not participate in its overall market growth 
the ads segment reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to operating profit of million for the prior year 
the significant operating losses during were due primarily to lower intermec gross profits that were insufficient to absorb selling  general and administrative expenses

integrated production systems backlog decreased from million at december  to million at december  backlog at the end of was at a record high level and included significant multi year contracts  whereas backlog at december  comprises nearer term deliveries and reflects the slowing of automotive markets 
the company believes the trends of lower capital spending by domestic automakers will continue into advanced manufacturing equipment ame revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues reflects continued weakness in the domestic aerospace related general machine tool market 
the segment reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to operating profit of million for the prior year 
the loss for is due primarily to lower domestic sales and backlog levels and the corresponding impact on margins due to unabsorbed fixed costs 
in addition  ame recorded million in employee severance related expenses in the fourth quarter of backlog decreased from million at december  to million at december  costs and expenses cost of sales and service decreased million to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in costs of sales as a percentage of sales is due to the above mentioned factors contributing to fluctuations in segment operating profit loss  primarily underabsorbed manufacturing overhead  lower sales volume and fourth quarter adjustments 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due to lower selling expenses  primarily at intermec  offset partially by additional costs for accounts receivable securitization

net interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to higher outstanding debt during that was incurred to finance the acquisitions of cincinnati machine  r b machine and amtech systems and the normal capital expenditures and working capital needs of the operations 
foreign currency transactions the company is subject to the effects of international currency fluctuations due to the global nature of its operations 
currency transaction net losses for the year ended december   were not significant 
currency transaction net losses for the year ended december  were million  after taxes 
currency transaction net gains for the year ended december  were not significant 
it is not possible to predict the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations beyond the near term because revenues generated from particular foreign jurisdictions vary widely over time 
for fiscal year  the company derived approximately of its revenues from non us customers 
at december   long lived assets attributable to foreign countries comprised of total assets 
as the largest components of these foreign assets are attributable to european nations  primarily the united kingdom  germany  and sweden  the exposure of long lived assets to foreign currency fluctuations or expropriations is not significant 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased from million at december  to million at december  total debt increased from million at december  to million at december  net debt  defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  improved to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in net debt is due primarily to proceeds from the sale of amtech partially offset by normal capital expenditures and cash used in operating activities 
the company maintains a committed revolving credit facility as amended and restated on february   the credit facility with a group of banks that is guaranteed by the domestic subsidiaries of the company and secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations on liens contained in the indenture governing the company s outstanding senior debentures 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company may borrow in stated increments up to an aggregate of million through november  the company may borrow at the base rate or the adjusted london inter bank offered rate  each as defined in the credit facility  plus an applicable margin 
additionally  the credit facility includes a facility fee and duration fee  each as defined in the credit facility and computed based on the most recent aggregate commitment 
the credit facility places limits on the company and its domestic subsidiaries  including limits on domestic cash balances  capital expenditures  liens  investments  sale or pledge of assets  dividend payments  and incurrence of debt or guarantees and establishes permitted levels of minimum consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facility 
net proceeds from the sale of assets not in the ordinary course of business and from certain issuances of debt and equity must be applied to the reduction of amounts outstanding and commitments under the credit facility 
outstanding borrowings under this facility were million and million at december  and  respectively 
for the period from june  to february   the company sold interests in a revolving pool of its trade accounts receivable to a financial institution which issues short term debt backed by receivables acquired in similar transactions 
at december  and net proceeds of million and million  respectively  were reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization agreements are classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december  and such costs were million and million  respectively 
simultaneously with the february  amendment and restatement of the credit facility  these arrangements were terminated and the company repurchased the financial institution s interest in the pool of trade receivables for approximately million in cash 
management believes that opportunities exist to generate significant liquidity through the monetization of certain of the company s assets 
expected cash flows from these opportunities  successful execution of the company s operating plans  current financing agreements  and expected refinancing of the credit facility by november  should provide the company with adequate liquidity to meet its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
the company expects to use cash for operations and capital expenditures during fiscal excluding the effect of cash inflows from the monetization of assets  this cash usage would result in higher outstanding debt and significantly higher interest expense and financing charges in inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates and has not had a significant impact upon the results of its operations

foreign exchange rates due to its global operations  the company s cash flow and earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when appropriate  the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates by entering into short term foreign currency exchange contracts 
as of december   the company held short term contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency cash flows with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the company does not enter into any foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
contracts that effectively meet risk reduction and correlation criteria are accounted for as hedges and  accordingly  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are deferred in the cost basis of the underlying transaction 
in those circumstances when it is not appropriate to account for contracts as hedges  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded currently in earnings 
a hypothetical change in the relevant currency rates at december  would not result in a material gain or loss 
additionally  any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  should be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item
