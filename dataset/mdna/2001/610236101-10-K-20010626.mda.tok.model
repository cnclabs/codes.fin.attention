speedy acquisition on september   the company completed the acquisition of company operated and dealer operated speedy stores  all located in the united states 
sales for the speedy fiscal year ended january  for the company operated stores  some of which were opened only part of the year  were approximately million 
although the speedy stores were in the same general markets in which the company competed  the monro and speedy locations were mainly situated in non overlapping areas 
while monro has tended to open stores in suburban and small town locations  speedy had tended to locate in major metropolitan areas 
therefore  the combination represented an excellent geographic fit 
prior to the acquisition  the speedy stores were experiencing significant declining comparable store sales and ebitda margins 
the company believes that the attention of speedy s management was diverted to the expansion of its european operations 
in addition  speedy s management did not respond to the declining exhaust business by offering other services  as had monro 
the result was that the acquisition had a dilutive effect on earnings in the fiscal year 
the weakness in speedy s sales from september through march represented a continuation of a decline which was most pronounced prior to the acquisition in september the conversion of systems and inventory during the third quarter of fiscal at all company operated acquired speedy stores also impacted the performance of these locations 
these conversions involved the installation of new point of sale systems in the acquired speedy stores  as well as the return of slow moving items to manufacturers and restocking with more popular parts  representing approximately half of the inventory in the speedy stores 
the new point of sale systems put all of the company operated acquired speedy stores on monro s centralized distribution and automatic replenishment system whereas  previously  each store received parts directly from the various manufacturers 
although essential to margin improvement in future periods  this conversion process was very disruptive to the operations of the acquired speedy stores in the third quarter of fiscal the company did experience a substantial reduction in cost of goods in the acquired speedy stores between the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  through reduced outside purchases and lower acquisition costs from vendors as parts were distributed through the company s centralized distribution system 
it was management s belief that  with moderately improved sales and further cost reductions  the acquired operations would begin to contribute to earnings per share during fiscal  and should be increasingly accretive in subsequent years 
this belief proved to be true  with the speedy stores solidly accretive for the years ended march  and fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal decreased 
million  or 
from fiscal sales 
the decrease was due to a loss of sales from closed stores of million and a comparable store sales decrease of 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately million from stores opened since april  there were selling days in fiscal year and days in fiscal year during the year  four stores were opened and five were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
management believes that the comparable store sales decrease resulted  in part  from manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on almost all new cars beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s which has extended the life of exhaust systems and resulted in declining exhaust sales 
however  management believes that these declines were partially offset by positive industry factors including an increase in the average age of vehicles  a decrease in the number of service bays  an increase in the number of registered vehicles  and a shift in the consumer mentality from do it yourself to do it for me caused by the increased complexity of cars and aging population 
it is also management s belief that the decline in exhaust sales is beginning to level off as the vehicles manufactured with stainless steel exhaust systems continue to age  particularly in the northeast which experiences more severe winter weather conditions 
additionally  management believes that the company s strategy of product diversification and expanded manager training assisted in minimizing the comparable store sales decline vis a vis its competitors 
the company introduced scheduled maintenance services in all of its stores late in the fourth quarter of fiscal these services are required by vehicle manufacturers to comply with warranty schedules  and are offered by monro in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers can provide 
management believes that these services  which are offered both in bundled packages and individually  will make a positive contribution to comparable store sales in future years  and continue to help to mitigate the aforementioned challenges to comparable store sales which negatively impacted recent fiscal years 
in addition  management believes that comparable store sales have suffered in recent years from a decline in vehicle population in the five to nine year old segment 
although the number of registered vehicles has increased steadily in recent years  the early s recession in new car sales negatively impacted this particular segment of the vehicle population 
this segment represents the prime repair age of vehicles and is the target market for the company s services 
however  as a result of increased car sales in the mid to late s  the five to nine year old segment began to increase in calendar gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to a decrease in technician labor costs as a percent of sales due to improved productivity and control during the year ended march  however  this improvement was partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percent of sales reflecting the impact of fixed costs such as rent and depreciation against a decline in comparable store sales 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by 
million to million and  as a percentage of sales  increased by 
as compared to fiscal although spending was relatively flat in this line item  there was pressure on certain expense lines which were overcome through savings in others 
more employees earned a bonus in fiscal than in fiscal  increasing expense by 
million 
additionally  utilities increased by approximately 
million over the prior year due to colder weather and higher gas prices 
due to the hardening of the insurance market  the company also experienced an increase in insurance costs in the form of increased deductibles this in spite of a lower number and relatively flat dollar amount of claims as compared to fiscal these increases were offset  however  by strong cost control in other areas such as health care costs and field operations support costs 
additionally  there was an increase in cooperative advertising credits resulting from improved purchasing agreements with the company s major parts suppliers 
operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  increased by 
million over the fiscal level of million  due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased as a percent of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the weighted average interest rate for the year ended march  was approximately 
higher than the rate of for the year ended march  however  the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  decreased by approximately million from fiscal  resulting in a decrease in expense between the two years 
other expense  net  at 
of sales for the year ended march  decreased from 
of sales for the year ended march  this decrease was primarily due to less expense related to store closings 
the company s effective tax rate was of pre tax income in both fiscal and fiscal net income for fiscal increased by million or as compared to fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million  or over sales for fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately million for stores opened since april   including million from the newly acquired speedy stores  partially offset by a loss of sales from closed monro stores and a comparable store sales decrease of 
during the year  stores were opened and were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to an increase in occupancy costs as a percent of sales reflecting the impact of fixed costs such as rent and depreciation against a decline in comparable store sales and soft new store sales 
additionally  labor costs increased over the prior year 
during periods of slower sales when technicians may not be fully productive  they receive a minimum base level wage which increases labor cost as a percent of sales 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million and  as a percentage of sales  decreased by as compared to fiscal the decline as a percentage of sales is due to several factors including increased cooperative advertising credits resulting from improved purchasing agreements with the company s major parts suppliers  further reductions in corporate overhead and field supervision begun in fiscal  and non recurring yk costs in fiscal since the company did not attain the minimum required percentage of targeted profit performance  employee bonus payments and profit sharing contributions were significantly reduced from previous  more profitable years 
operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  increased by million over the fiscal level of million due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased as a percent of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  was approximately million greater than the amount outstanding for the year ended march  additionally  the weighted average interest rate increased by approximately 
other expense  net  at 
of sales for the year ended march  increased from 
of sales for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to amortization of goodwill from the speedy acquisition and expenses related to monro store closings

capital resources and liquidity capital resources the company s primary capital requirements for fiscal were divided among the funding of its new store expansion program and the upgrading of facilities and systems in existing stores  totaling million  as well as net principal payments on long term debt and capital leases of million 
in both fiscal years and  these capital requirements were primarily met by cash flow from operations and through the use of a revolving credit facility 
in december  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan for up to  of the company s common shares 
in may  the board of directors approved an increase of  shares  bringing the total authorization to  shares 
during fiscal and  the company purchased approximately  and  shares  respectively at an aggregate price of and 
million  respectively 
purchases of the shares are expected to be made from time to time  depending upon market conditions 
in fiscal  the company intends to open approximately five new stores 
total capital required to open a new store ranges  on average based upon the last three fiscal years openings excluding the acquired speedy stores  from  to  depending on whether the store is leased  owned or land leased 
management believes that the company has sufficient resources available including cash and equivalents  cash flow from operations and bank financing to expand its business as currently planned for the next several years 
liquidity concurrent with the closing of the speedy acquisition in september  the company obtained a new million secured credit facility from a syndication of lenders led by the chase manhattan bank 
approximately million was borrowed under this facility to pay the all cash purchase price  including transaction expenses of approximately million 
in addition  the company refinanced approximately million of indebtedness through the new credit facility  with the balance of the facility available for future working capital needs 
more specifically  the new financing structure consists of a million term loan of which approximately million was outstanding at march   a million revolving credit facility of which approximately million was outstanding at march   and synthetic lease off balance sheet financing for a significant portion of the speedy real estate  totaling million of which approximately million was outstanding at march  
the loans bear interest at the prime rate or other libor based rate options tied to the company s financial performance 
the company must also pay a facility fee on the unused portion of the commitment 
the credit facility has a five year term 
interest only is payable monthly on the revolving credit and synthetic lease borrowings throughout the term 
in addition to monthly interest payments  the million term loan requires quarterly principal payments which began september  the term loan and revolving credit facility are secured by all accounts receivable  inventory and other personal property 
the company has also entered into a negative pledge agreement not to encumber any real property  with certain permissible exceptions 
the synthetic lease is secured by the real property to which it relates 
within the aforementioned million revolving credit facility  the company has available a subfacility of million for the purpose of issuing stand by letters of credit

million 
both obligations require monthly interest payments  and each may be converted from a floating rate to a fixed rate loan before the last two years of their respective terms 
the mortgage requires equal monthly installments of principal based on a year amortization period  and the term loan requires constant monthly payments of principal to fully amortize the debt over the eight year term 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution which effectively fixes the interest rate over the terms of the aforementioned agreements at 
interest is payable monthly on the mortgage notes payable which have seven year terms 
equal monthly installments of principal are required based on year amortization periods

financial accounting standards on june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement standardizes the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and requires that all derivatives be recognized in the statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are to be reported in earnings 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from potential changes in interest rates 
the company regularly evaluates these risks and has entered into four interest rate swap agreements  expiring from to  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the agreements limit the interest rate exposure on the company s floating rate debt via the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
fixed rates under these agreements range from to 
at march  and  approximately and respectively  of the company s long term debt  excluding capital leases  is at fixed interest rates and therefore  the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates 
long term debt  including current portion  had a carrying amount of million and a fair value of million as of march   as compared to a carrying amount of million and a fair value of million as of march  the company s cash flow exposure on floating rate debt  which is not supported by interest rate swap agreements  would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately 
million for each of the years ended march  and  given a change in libor 
the company believes the amount of risk and the use of derivative financial instruments described above are not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations
