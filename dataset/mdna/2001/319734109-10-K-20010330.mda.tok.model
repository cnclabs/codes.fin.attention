net interest spread is the arithmetic difference between yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets 
average balances the consolidated comparative statement analysis table sets forth a comparison of average daily balances  interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis and interest rates calculated for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for purposes of this analysis  the computations in the consolidated comparative statement analysis were prepared using the federal statutory rate of  there are no state or local taxes on income applicable to the company 
for further information relating to the effective income tax rate of the company  see note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income on loans included loan fees of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest income on loans  investments and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the primary source of earnings for the company 
therefore  changes in this category can be essential to the overall net income of the company 
the net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  amounted to  for  an increase of  over  in as shown in the rate volume analysis table  the increase in net interest income in was attributable to higher net interest income of  due to changes in volume and a reduction in net interest income of  due to changes in rates 
the volume related change resulted primarily from increases in investment securities and average balances for loans see discussions on loan portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale  partially offset by an increase in time deposits and debt 
the rate related change was primarily the result of the increase of interest paid on time deposits and debt  offset in part by increases in the interest rate earned on investments and loans 
net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  in increased  over the figure of  this increase was the result of growth in investments  reduced in part by a decrease in loans and an increase in time deposits 
also affecting was the decrease in interest rates paid on deposits and debt  and an increase in the interest rate earned on investments  offset in part by a decline in the interest rates earned on loans 
the net interest margin  a measure of net interest income performance  is determined by dividing net interest income by total interest earning assets 
the net interest margin was for  for and for the decrease in was the result of the increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities being greater than the increase in the average interest rate earned on interest earning assets 
the result was a decline in the interest spread  the difference of interest earned on assets less the interest paid on deposits and debt 
the interest spread was  and for  and  respectively 
the impact on earnings by the reduction in the interest spread was diminished in part by the  increase in of non interest bearing deposits 
the following table sets forth a rate volume analysis  which segregates in detail the major factors that contributed to the changes in net interest income for the years ended december  and  as compared to the respective previous periods  into amounts attributable to both rate and volume variances 
in calculating the variances  the changes were first segregated into changes in volume change in volume times the old rate  changes in rates change in rate times the old volume and changes in rate volume changes in rate times the change in volume 
the changes in rate volume have been allocated in their entirety to the change in rates 
the interest income included in the rate volume analysis table has been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent amount using the federal statutory tax rate of 
non accruing loans have been used in the daily average balances to determine changes in interest income due to volume

fluctuations in interest will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since most of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities are located at the bank  the majority of the company s interest rate risk is at the bank level 
as a result  most interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level see discussion on interest rate sensitivity 
the company and the bank operate as a community banking institution primarily in the counties of northampton  lehigh and monroe  pennsylvania 
as a result of its location and nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank makes real estate loans primarily in the counties adjacent to its operations and thus is subject to risks associated with those local economies 
the bank holds a concentration of residential real estate loans of total loans and commercial loans supported by real estate of total loans in its loan portfolio 
in addition  of the bank s consumer  installment loans are for recreational vehicles 
these loans represent of total loans see note q of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these loans are subject to interest and economic risks 
the bank also originates residential real estate loans for sale in the secondary market 
such loans are identified as mortgage loans held for sale on the company s balance sheet and are subject to interest rate risk see discussion on mortgage loans held for sale 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps see discussions on investment securities and securities available for sale 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the extent to which net interest income would change due to changes in the level of interest rates 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to reduce a company s vulnerability to future interest rate fluctuations and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income 
the bank s asset liability management committee meets semi monthly to examine  among other subjects  interest rates for various products and interest sensitivity 
rate sensitivity arises from the difference between the volumes of assets which are rate sensitive as compared to the volumes of liabilities which are rate sensitive 
a comparison of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities is monitored by the bank on a regular basis using several time periods 
the mismatch of assets and liabilities in a specific time frame is referred to as interest sensitivity gap 
generally  in an environment of rising interest rates  a negative gap interest sensitive liabilities being greater than interest sensitive assets in a given period of time will decrease net interest income  and in an environment of falling interest rates  a negative gap will increase net interest income 
assets and liabilities are allocated to a specific time period based on their scheduled repricing date or on an historical basis 
at december   assets of  of total assets were subject to interest rate changes within one year 
this compares to assets subject to interest rate changes within one year of  of total assets at the end of and  of total assets at the end of liabilities subject to rate change within one year were   and  in  and  respectively 
a negative one year gap position of  existed as of december  the gap positions at december  and were negative  and negative  respectively 
the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for the one year time frame was 
at the end of  compared to 
at the end of and 
at the end of the interest sensitivity analysis in the following table presents a sensitivity gap analysis of the company s assets and liabilities at december  for five time intervals 
the company s negative gap position for the one year time frame increased in as a result of an increase in interest bearing demand deposits and short term borrowings with a maturity of one year or less and a reduction of loan maturities 
the change in the deposit mix was due to the sale of longer term certificates of deposit to customers 
the change in loan maturities was due in part to the sale of residential mortgage loans 
management intends to continue to purchase adjustable rate securities  make adjustable rate loans  market longer term certificates of deposit and sell fixed rate mortgage loans to maintain an acceptable gap position 
interest sensitivity analysis over days days days years years total interest bearing deposits with banks inv securities       loans       other assets    total assets       non interest bearing deposits   int bearing deposits       securities sold under agreements to repurchase   short term debt   long term debt     other   capital   total liabilities and capital       net interest sensitivity gap     cumulative int sensitivity gap     cumulative gap rsa rsl historically  non interest bearing deposits reflect insignificant change in deposit trends and  therefore  the company classifies these deposits over five years 
while using the interest sensitivity gap analysis is a useful management tool because it considers the quantity of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in a given time period  it does not consider the relative sensitivity to market interest rate changes that are characteristic of various interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
consequently  even though the company currently has a negative gap position because of the unequal sensitivity of these assets and liabilities  management believes that this position will not materially impact earnings in a changing rate environment 
for example  changes in the prime rate on variable commercial loans may not result in an equal change in the rate of money market deposits or short term certificates of deposit 
a simulation model is therefore used to estimate the impact of various changes  both upward and downward  in market interest rates and volumes of assets and liabilities on the bank s net income 
this model produces an interest rate exposure report that forecasts changes in the market value of portfolio equity under alternative interest rate environments 
the market value of portfolio equity is defined as the present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of changes in the market value of portfolio equity at december  are as follows at december  percent of change in market value changes in rate of portfolio equity basis points basis points basis points basis points flat rate basis points basis points basis points basis points the assumptions used in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates are based on management s consideration of past experience  current position and anticipated future economic conditions 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the assumptions on which the calculations were based 
service charges and other income service charge income on deposit accounts amounted to  in compared to  in and  in in  the service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or over and the increase over was  or 
the increases in and were primarily the result of increases in the number of deposit accounts and increases in some deposit related fees  including charges for the use by non depositors of the bank s automated teller machines and the bank s debit card

fees are assessed by the trust division to some customers based on the market value of the assets held in the customers account 
as a result  changing market values will impact the revenues earned from trust operations 
other expenses salaries and employee benefits represent a significant portion of non interest expense 
these expenses  amounting to  increased by  or in compared to  in these expenses in amounted to an increase of  or over the  reported in the increase in was primarily due to salary increases of approximately  the addition of staff related to the new branches opened in mount pocono  whitehall and trexlertown during the year and a cash bonus paid to non officer employees  reduced in part by staff reductions during the fourth quarter in operations and administration 
salary expense in increased due to normal salary increases of approximately  the addition of staff in the trust division  and the opening of the stroudsburg branch 
occupancy and equipment expenses were  in which was  or greater than the amount of  the amount was  greater than the occupancy and equipment expense of  the increase in was primarily due to the establishment of the new branches in mount pocono  whitehall and trexlertown and a complete year of occupancy expenses for the stroudsburg branch opened in the increase in was the result of the stroudsburg branch and new equipment relating to the yk issue

making loans to businesses and individuals entails risks to the company  including ascertaining cash flows  evaluating the credit history  assets and liabilities of a potential borrower  and determining the value of the various types of collateral pledged as security 
lending involves determining risks  managing those risks and charging an appropriate interest rate to compensate for taking such risks  and to cover the cost of funds see previous discussion on market risk 
the loan to deposit ratio was at december  and at december  additional information concerning loans is shown in note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the company services all of the residential mortgage loans sold and plans to continue this practice 
non performing loans the following discussion relates to the bank s non performing loans  which consist of loans on a non accrual basis and accruing loans which are past due ninety days or more 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is in doubt 
the company recognizes these loans as non accrual  but considers the principal to be substantially collectible because the loans are protected by adequate collateral or other resources 
payments received on non accrual loans are applied to principal until such time as the principal is paid off 
any additional payments are then recognized as interest income 
loans on non accrual status totaled  at december  this balance represented a  decrease in non accrual loans during due to the collection efforts on certain commercial  residential real estate and consumer loans 
management believes there is sufficient collateral to cover any possible losses on these loans 
the company did not have any significantloans that qualify as troubled debt restructuring as defined by sfas no

the company measures impairment of a loan based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
sfas no 
allows creditors to use existing methods for recognizing interest income on impaired loans 
the company has identified a loan as impaired when it is probable that interest and principal will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the accrual of interest is discontinued in such loans and no income is recognized until all recorded amounts of interest and principal are recovered in full 
loan impairment is measured by estimating the expected future cash flows and discounting them at the respective effective interest rate or by valuing the underlying collateral 
the recorded investment in these loans and the valuation for credit losses related to loan impairment at december  and are as follows dollars in thousands at december  principal amount of impaired loans accrued interest deferred loan costs less valuation allowance at december  the activity in the allowance account for credit losses related to impaired loans is as follows dollars in thousands for the year valuation allowance at january  provision for loan impairment direct charge offs recoveries transfers to unallocated reserve valuation allowance at december  total cash collected on impaired loans during was  of which  was credited to the principal balance outstanding on such loans  and  was recognized as interest income

in  and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses was  for the years ended december  and december  and  for the year ended december  in  the decrease in the provision was  from the allowance for possible loan losses is established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expenses 
loans are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio are managed through various control processes  including credit evaluations of individual borrowers  periodic reviews  diversification by industry  and the establishment of lending targets to various segments of the portfolio 
risk is further mitigated through the application of lending procedures such as the holding of adequate collateral and the establishment of contractual guarantees 
management believes that these procedures provide adequate assurances against the adverse impact from any event or set of conditions  and that the level of the allowance for possible loan losses is sufficient to meet the present and potential risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  including the current level of non performing and past due loans 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated based on an assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment results in an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects possible losses resulting from the analysis of individual loans  pools of loans and commitments 
the specific allowance allocations for individual loans is based on an analysis of individual loans where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
the general allocation for pools of loans and commitments is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current trends in areas such as lending policies  economic conditions  delinquencies and concentrations 
the historical loss factor is determined using actual loss experience and the related internal risk rating of loans charged off 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is a function of the total allowance and the allocated portion of the allowance 
the analysis of the allowance is performed quarterly and historical factors are updated periodically based on actual experience
