liquidity and capital resources on october   the company entered into a  revolving credit facility the credit facility with fleet national bank and first union national bank collectively the banks  which matures on october  the credit facility consists of a  revolving credit line the revolver and a  credit line to be utilized for acquisitions the acquisition line 
the credit facility is collateralized by a pledge of the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants 
these covenants include a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and minimum net worth requirements as those terms are defined in the credit agreement 
during the quarters ended june  and september   the company did not meet these three covenants and on october  received an irrevocable commitment letter from the banks to amend the credit facility and waive the covenant violations 
the commitment letter also provides for a new borrowing structure which will enable the company to borrow a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable  domestic inventory  the appraised value of the company s emporia  kansas facility  the net book value of domestic machinery and equipment and certain historic royalty streams  as defined collectively the borrowing base up to a maximum of  the commitment letter also provides that  less outstanding letters of credit may be borrowed in addition to the amounts available under the borrowing base

the commitment letter provides for borrowings through october  and requires that a minimum tangible net worth covenant be met  beginning with the quarter ending december  the commitment letter also requires minimum operating income covenants of  for the quarter ending december    for the quarter ending march  and  for the quarter ending june  based on management s estimates  the company s eligible borrowing base through june   plus the additional  will total approximately  in accordance with the terms of the commitment letter  the company is presently able to classify  of the amounts outstanding at june  under the credit facility as long term 
the remaining  has been classified as current  of which  has subsequently been repaid and management believes approximately  will be able to be classified as long term once certain terms of the amended credit facility are finalized 
the ability to achieve the covenants depends in part on the management s successful execution of its restructuring plan as discussed in note  and other business factors outside of the control of management 
there can be no guarantee that such covenants will be met 
accordingly  if the covenants are not met  amounts outstanding under the commitment letter would become payable on demand 
management believes that alternative sources of financing are available to refinance the existing facilities on a long term basis 
however  if the loans become due on demand and alternative financing sources are not available  management will be required to take additional actions to reduce operating expenses or sell assets to meet liquidity needs

the company recorded restructuring charges in the amount of  and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
these charges are associated with a restructuring plan initiated in march  which is expected to reduce the company s worldwide cost base and strengthen its competitive position as a leading global supplier of auxiliary equipment to the printing and publishing industry 
prior to the restructuring  the company was managed in a decentralized manner through geographically dispersed autonomous business units 
given that many of the company s significant customers have been reorganizing on a global basis  management decided to restructure the company along functional lines on a global basis 
rather than have administrative  sales  product development and production activities at each decentralized business unit  the restructuring plan included the centralization of these activities 
product lines that were previously being produced in the emporia  kansas  shelton  connecticut  malmo  sweden  augsburg  germany and lombard  illinois facilities  are being consolidated with the production facilities located in augsburg  germany  emporia  kansas and malmo  sweden 
roll handling products previously produced in the rockford  illinois facility were being consolidated with similar products designed and manufactured in the company s facilities in shanghai  china and amal  sweden 
these roll handling businesses were sold on september  the corporate headquarters was vacated and relocated to the shelton  connecticut facility in order to take advantage of the space created by the downsizing previously noted 
the restructuring charge of  recorded during the fiscal year ended june  includes approximately  in employee severance and benefit costs   in facility lease termination costs  and  in incremental costs associated with this overall restructuring 
as of june    is included in other accounts payable and accrued liabilities and  is included in other long term liabilities 
the company expects to incur approximately  in additional restructuring costs during the fiscal year ended june   which will be expensed as incurred 
the estimated total cash cost of the restructuring program is expected to be approximately  with approximately  expected to be spent over the next twelve months and approximately  primarily facility lease costs expected to be spent over the balance of the lease terms of approximately three years 
the restructuring program is expected to save the company approximately  annually following full implementation  which is anticipated to occur by june   and is expected to restore the company s profitability and cash flow from operations 
the company believes its cash flow from operations  available bank lines of credit and alternative sources of borrowing are sufficient to finance its working capital and other capital requirements for the near and long term future 
euro conversion effective january   the euro has become the new common currency for countries of the european community ec including germany and france where the company has operations 
other member states including the united kingdom and sweden where the company also has operations may join in future years 
beginning january   transactions in the euro became possible  with the national currencies continuing to circulate until january   when the euro will become the functional currency for these countries 
during the transition period from january  to january   payments can be made using either the euro or the national currencies at fixed exchange rates 
beginning january   the company began conducting business with customers in both the euro and the respective national currency 
systems and processes that are initially impacted by this dual currency requirement are customer billing and receivables  payroll and cash management activities  including cash collections and disbursements 
to accomplish compliance  the company is making the necessary systems and process changes and is also working with its financial institutions on various cash management issues 
the company s german and french operations have begun recording all business transactions in the euro effective july  and july   respectively 
management currently believes that the costs associated with implementing and completing the euro conversion  as well as business and market implications  if any  associated with the euro conversion  will not be material to its results of operations or financial condition in any year or in the aggregate 
the competitive impact of increased cross border price transparency  however  is uncertain  both with respect to products sold by the company  as well as products and services purchased by the company 
the company s ongoing efforts with regard to the euro conversion  and those of its significant customers and suppliers  including financial institutions may  at some time in the future  reveal as yet unidentified or not fully understood issues that may not be addressable in a timely fashion  or that may cause unexpected competitive or market effects  all contrary to the foregoing statements 
this issue  if not resolved favorably  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition in a future period

interest rate and debt sensitivity as of june   the company had debt totaling  most of which bears interest at floating rates 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on april   with a notional amount of  and a fixed rate of 
interest rate swaps act as hedges of the underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the debt instruments 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis as of june   assuming a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates  swaps and debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
however  actual increases or decreases in earnings in the future could differ materially from this analysis based on the timing and amount of both interest rate changes and amounts borrowed by the company 
currency exchange rate sensitivity the company derived approximately of its revenues from countries outside of the united states for the fiscal year ended june  results were and continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

the company also maintains certain levels of cash denominated in various currencies which acts as a natural overall hedge

the company performed a sensitivity analysis as of june  assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
holding all other variables constant  the analysis indicated that such a market movement would affect the company s pre tax income by approximately  however  actual gains and losses in the future could differ materially from this analysis based on the timing and amount of both foreign currency exchange rate movements and the company s actual exposures and hedges
