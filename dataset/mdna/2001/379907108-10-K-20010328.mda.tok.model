johnson county is a suburban community near kansas city 
johnson county has a more competitive banking environment than the company s smaller markets  but its robust economic growth has enabled gold bank to rapidly grow its loans and deposits in the county 
gold bank has five offices in growing areas of johnson county and one office in the kansas city county club plaza district 
this presence in kansas accounted for approximately of the company s total assets at year end the company entered the tulsa  oklahoma  market in with the acquisition of citizens bank of tulsa  which has subsequently been merged into gold bank oklahoma 
the tulsa location serves a rapidly growing area in southeastern tulsa  a light industrial district that is home to more than small businesses  and a mature residential area of tulsa 
a third office was opened in a developing residential area of south tulsa during the second quarter of the company entered edmond  oklahoma city and outlying communities in central and western oklahoma with the acquisition of county banc in march country banc s two subsidiary banks  people first and american heritage  were also merged along with tulsa to create gold bank oklahoma 
the edmond location serves a rapidly growing area in northeastern oklahoma city and is in process of opening a new branch in the growing corridor and residential area in northwestern oklahoma city 
gold bank oklahoma also serves a number of smaller  mature markets and rural communities in central and western oklahoma 
the consolidated gold bank oklahoma market accounted for approximately of the company s total assets at year end the company entered the bradenton and sarasota  florida market on the highly popular and rapidly growing west coast of the state between tampa and naples with the acquisition of the american bank in march the american bank acquisition provides the company with a new  diversified market that has been one of the fastest growing population areas in the united states for the past years 
the demographics and per capita income levels are believed to be very promising for the development of wealth and asset management services for the company 
the florida market accounted for approximately of the company s total assets at year end other local markets where the company operates generally did not experience the level of growth seen in johnson county  tulsa  edmund and bradenton  but their economies were sound  with a mix of services  manufacturing and agriculture related industries 
each of the local markets is generally a county seat and the company s locations serve both that city and the surrounding area 
financial services  including traditional and on line banking  brokerage  trust  mortgage and investments  are offered to current customers of the banks  either directly through representatives located in bank offices or through telecommunication links with the non bank offices 
influences on earnings the company s net income depends upon the combined results of operations of the banks  each of which conducts a commercial and consumer banking business by attracting deposits from the general public and deploying those funds to earning assets 
in addition  the non bank subsidiaries contribute income from management fees and commissions 
each bank s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is interest income on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets include loans  investment securities and other earning assets  such as federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include customer deposits  time and savings deposits and other borrowings such as federal funds purchased  short term borrowings and long term debt  including junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
besides the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  net interest income is affected by each bank s interest rate spread 
this spread is the difference between the bank s average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is impacted by changes in interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand  among other factors 
the levels of non interest income and non interest expense also affect the company s profitability 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is non interest income of the banks and non bank subsidiaries  consisting of investment trading fees and commissions  service fees  gains on the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities  and other fees 
non interest expense consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses  deposit insurance premiums  expenses of opening bank offices  acquisition related expenses and other operating expenses 
the company s profitability also is affected by the effective tax rate  the banks provision for loan losses  and various non recurring items

provision for loan losses an integral part of merging credit portfolios in the company s mergers requires converting the purchased banks credit culture and credit standards to that of the company 
inherent with this implementation of these processes and procedures is a potential for increased credit risk 
to prepare for this risk  the company generally increases its provisions to prepare for any credit exposure 
it is anticipated  that as these merged banks adopt and implement these procedures credit risk should decline  requiring lower provisions 
the provision for loan losses was million for compared to million for  a decrease 
non performing loans increased to million as of december  as compared to million at december  the provision for loan losses was million for compared to million for  a increase 
the increase in the provision was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in total loans outstanding at december  compared to the end of  and in preparation for any potential credit risk  while implementing credit procedures in the banks acquired during and non interest income the following table presents the components of the company s non interest income for the years indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands service fees    investment trading fees and commissions    net gains on sales of mortgage loans    unrealized losses on trading securities realized losses gains on sale of securities  information technology services   trust fees   merchant fees   other income    total non interest income    non interest income as a percentage of average total assets non interest income was million for compared to million for  a decrease

other non interest expense was higher in primarily because consolidation repositioning pooling expenses were million greater than total non interest expense was million for compared to million for  representing a increase 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of million  or  in professional services decreased million  or  as a result of legal and accounting expenses associated with numerous acquisitions completed in and the profit improvement study commissioned by the company at a cost of approximately  net occupancy expense increased million or  due to the purchase transactions completed during other non interest expense increased million  or  in the increase in other non interest expense was primarily attributed to repositioning consolidation expenses incurred during income tax expense income tax expense was million for compared to million for  a million  or  decrease

the increase in effective tax rate from is the result of certain non deductible expenses related to the closure of gold banc mortgage and non deductible pooling expenses related to the acquisitions 
the effective tax rate differs from the expected rate of due primarily to the earnings of citizens bancorporation  inc  which as a subchapter s corporation  was not subject to tax prior to the acquisition by the company

asset liability management asset liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly  through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s assets and liabilities in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position will normally result in greater changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  the company and the banks use an asset liability modeling methodology to analyze each bank s current gap position 
that methodology simulates the banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income under several interest rate assumptions 
the company strives to maintain an aggregate gap position  so that changes in interest rates will not negatively affect net interest income by more than in any twelve month period 
the company has not engaged in derivatives or hedging transactions to synthetically alter net interest income 
the following table indicates that at december   in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in income

the company has the ability to reprice the rates on savings deposits and interest bearing checking 
historically  the rates on these deposits have not been repriced when rates have had small movements

asset quality the company follows regulatory guidelines in placing loans on a non accrual basis and places loans with doubtful principal repayment on a non accrual basis  whether current or past due 
the company considers non performing assets to include all non accrual loans  other loans past due days or more as to principal and interest with the exception of those loans which in management s opinion are well collateralized or exhibit other characteristics suggesting they are collectible  other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets 
the company does not return a loan to accrual status until it is brought current with respect to both principal and interest and future principal payments are no longer in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any previously accrued and uncollected interest income is reversed against current income 
restructured and impaired loans  other than non accrual loans  are considered insignificant for all years presented 
the company would have recorded additional interest in the amounts of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  if non accrual loans had been current during these periods 
non performing assets are summarized in the following table december  dollars in thousands loans loans days or more past due still accruing   non accrual loans      non performing loans      other assets foreclosed assets held for sale     non performing assets     non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets non performing assets as a percentage of total loans and oreo allowance for loan losses the success of a bank depends to a significant extent upon the quality of its assets  particularly loans 
this is highlighted by the fact that net loans are of the company s total assets as of december  credit losses are inherent in the lending business 
the risk of loss will vary with general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and the quality of the collateral in the case of a collateralized loan  among other things 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  management s experience  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for probable loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectability is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the company actively manages its past due and non performing loans in each bank in an effort to minimize credit losses  and monitors asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate for each bank and collectively  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used  or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of the company s net income and capital and could result in the inability to pay dividends  among other adverse consequences 
the allowance for loan losses on december   totaled million  or of outstanding loans  compared to million or at december  charge offs were million  recoveries were million and provisions charged to expense were million 
the allowance for loan losses on december   totaled million  a million increase from the prior year

in addition to deposits  the banks derive funds from interest payments  loan principal payments  loan and securities sales  and funds from operations 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
the banks may use borrowings on a short term basis  if necessary  to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds  or borrowings may be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes 
deposits are attracted principally from within the banks primary market area through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit including jumbo certificates in denominations of  or more  and retirement savings plans 
the banks have aggressively attempted to obtain deposits in selected markets to increase market share or meet particular liquidity needs 
the company has not used brokered deposits and has not sought to attract deposits outside its market areas 
maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the banks on a periodic basis 
the determination of rates and terms is predicated on funds transaction and liquidity requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal obligations 
during  average balances of non interest bearing demand deposits increased million  or  average balances of savings and interest bearing deposits decreased million  or  and average balances of time deposits increased million  or

liquidity defines the ability of the company and the banks to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy other disbursement needs  meet deposit withdrawals and other fund reductions  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
the immediate liquidity needs of the banks are met primarily by federal funds sold  short term investments  deposits and the generally predictable cash flow primarily repayments from each bank s assets 
intermediate term liquidity is provided by the banks investment portfolios 
the banks also have established a credit facility with the fhlb  under which the banks are eligible for short term advances and long term borrowings secured by real estate loans or mortgage related investments 
the company s liquidity needs and funding are provided through non affiliated bank borrowing  cash dividends and tax payments from its subsidiary banks 
as described in note to the financial statements  the company has a million line of credit with outstanding borrowings of million at december  cash provided by operating activities for was million  consisting primarily of net loss adjusted for non cash items and the sale of loans 
cash used in investing activities was million  consisting primarily of increased loans of approximately million and net investment security purchases of million 
investing activities were financed by deposits of approximately million and net borrowings of million and resulted in net cash provided of million 
capital 
the company and its subsidiaries actively monitor their compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
the elements of capital adequacy standards include strict definitions of core capital and total assets  which include off balance sheet items such as commitments to extend credit 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
historically  the banks have increased core capital through retention of earnings or capital infusions 
the primary source of funds available to the company is dividends by the subsidiaries 
each bank s ability to pay dividends may be limited by regulatory requirements 
at december   the subsidiaries could pay dividends without prior regulatory approval 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction or have the same magnitude as changes in the prices of goods and services 
accounting and financial reporting the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of condition and measure such instruments at fair value 
sfas  as amended by sfas and must be adopted by the company on january  the adoption of the standards did not have a significant impact on the financial statements of the company
