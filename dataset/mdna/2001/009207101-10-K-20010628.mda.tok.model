item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s two most significant components of revenue  which accounted for and of revenue  respectively  were generated through its air cargo subsidiaries  mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc 
csa  which are short haul express air freight carriers flying nightly contracts for a major express delivery company out of cities  principally located in states in the eastern half of the united states and in puerto rico  canada and the virgin islands and its ground support equipment subsidiary  global ground support  llc global 
global manufactures  sells and services aircraft deicers and other ground support equipment 
separate agreements cover the three types of aircraft operated by mac and csa cessna caravan  fokker f  and short brothers sd cessna caravan and fokker f aircraft a total of aircraft at march  are owned by and dry leased from a major air express company customer  and short brothers sd aircraft two aircraft at march  are owned by the company and operated under wet lease arrangements with the customer 
pursuant to such agreements  the customer determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover approximately of the revenue aircraft operated  the company passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by the customer at any time upon to days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with the customer are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
the company is not contractually precluded from providing such services to other firms  and has done so in the past 
loss of its contracts with the customer would have a material adverse effect on the company 
mountain aircraft services  llc s mas aircraft component repair services contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and are included in aircraft services and other in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings 
global ground support  llc global  manufactures  services and supports aircraft deicers and other ground support equipment on a worldwide basis 
global is operated as a subsidiary of mas 
global s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the significant increase in revenues in was primarily related to the june award of a four year   contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force 
the company was subsequently made aware that a competing bidder had filed a protest opposing the awarding of the contract to global 
in september the general accounting office finalized the denial of the protest and upheld the awarding of the air force contract to global 
as a result of the delays created by this protest  revenue originally anticipated to commence during the quarter ending december  was delayed until the quarter ending march  additionally  the protest and its resulting delay caused global to incur substantial legal fees and additional overhead costs relating to fixed production costs which would have been absorbed by operations but were reallocated to other product lines during fiscal resulting in lower margins in the existing product lines 
the company s four subsidiaries operate in three business segments 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the subsidiaries have been combined into the following reportable segments air cargo  aviation services and aviation ground equipment 
the accounting policies for all reportable segments are the same as those described in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income 
the following table summarizes the changes and trends in the company s expenses as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended march  operating revenue in thousands    expense as a percentage of revenue flight operations maintenance and brokerage ground equipment general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses seasonality global s business has historically been highly seasonal 
due to the nature of its product line  the bulk of global s revenues and earnings have typically occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the winter season  and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company has continued its efforts  started in fiscal  to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company expended exceptional effort in fiscal and to design and produce prototype equipment to expand its product line to include additional deicer models and three models of scissor lift equipment for catering  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft 
these costs were expensed as incurred 
as indicated above  in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force for a total amount of approximately million  and in january global received a million pedestal mounted deicer contract with the philadelphia international airport  expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that revenue from these contracts will contribute to management s plan to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues 
the remainder of the company s business is not materially seasonal
