item a market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company s borrowings at december  under the revolving credit agreement and lines of credit expose earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are either variable or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable

the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the quoted foreign currency exchange rate amounts to approximately million
