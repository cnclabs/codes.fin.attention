item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we began our operations in november  launched our first netphone product in july  and were established as a separate subsidiary of idt in october we have incurred net operating losses since inception and expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future  primarily as a result of increased sales and marketing efforts 
sources of revenue during fiscal  our revenues were derived from per minute charges we billed to our customers on a pre paid basis and from the sale of internet telephony equipment  such as yap gear and services primarily to resellers  idt and other carriers 
we anticipate that revenue in fiscal from services will increase in absolute terms as our products become more widely distributed 
in addition  we are selling web based advertising through our pc client  e mail properties acquired from mail 
com  as well as certain instant messenger services to leverage our customer reach 
approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal was generated from per minute charges we charge our retail customers mostly on a prepaid basis to use our services 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our revenue was derived from customers based outside of the united states 
as of july   we served over  active customers 
we recognize revenue as our customers utilize the balances in their prepaid accounts by placing calls 
as such  we have deferred revenue for all unutilized balances in our active customers accounts 
direct cost of revenue direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks  and routing their calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination 
these costs exclude depreciation and include o amounts paid to other carriers to terminate traffic on a per minute basis  o the cost of leased routers and access servers  o telecommunications costs  including the cost of local telephone lines to carry subscriber calls to our network  o the costs associated with leased lines connecting our network directly to the internet or to our operations centers and connecting our operations centers to the internet  o internet backbone costs  which are the amounts we pay to connect to the internet  o service providers for capacity  o costs associated with the manufacturing  purchasing and licensing of equipment  and o ad serving costs and e mail box hosting fees 
we expect our direct cost of revenue to increase in absolute terms over time to support our growing customer base 
while some of these costs are fixed  other costs vary on a per minute basis 
therefore  we anticipate volatility in our direct cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue  particularly as we expand our network and dynamically determine how we price our services 
we try to terminate calls on our own network whenever possible 
when we cannot terminate calls on our network  we terminate calls on the network of other suppliers  including idt 
we expect to continue to utilize this process 
we also expect the percentage of our traffic that we terminate with idt will decline in the future as we expand our own network and establish additional carrier inter connects 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing includes the expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales partners  advertising costs  travel  entertainment  referral fees and amounts paid to our strategic partners in connection with revenue sharing arrangements 
we expended significant capital to build brand recognition 
most of our sales and marketing expenses have gone toward securing significant and strategic relationships with a variety of internet companies 
many of these agreements with internet companies have since been restructured in a manner more favorable to us  or in some cases  terminated 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries of our employees and associated benefits  and the cost of insurance  legal  rent  utilities  shipping  consulting and other costs 
a large portion of our general and administrative expenses include operations and customer support 
these include the expenses associated with customer service and technical support  and consist primarily of the salaries and employment costs of the employees responsible for those efforts 
we expect general and administrative costs to decrease by operating more efficiently and by leveraging our existing infrastructure to support our growth 
over time  we expect these relatively fixed general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses primarily relate to our software and hardware infrastructure 
we depreciate our network equipment over its estimated useful life ranging from five to fifteen years using the straight line method 
we plan to acquire a domestic high capacity network to provide additional capacity to handle the expected increase in customer traffic as our business grows 
in addition  we will be adding more network hardware as traffic volumes justify 
as a result  depreciation will continue to increase capital expenditures for the deployment of our networks to manage increased call volumes 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized

specifically  revenue from services increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million in revenue for fiscal revenue from products decreased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal as we discontinue certain selling channels  primarily retail stores in the domestic market

total direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by percent from million for fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased from approximately percent for fiscal to approximately percent for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the impact of our subsidization of free minutes to strategic partners such as microsoft and yahoo as well as monthly recurring costs from leased lines and other connectivity in anticipation of increased traffic volumes from our various distribution relationships

depreciation will continue to increase as we increase capital expenditures for the deployment of our networks both domestically and internationally to manage increased call volumes 
upon the adoption of sfas no

restructuring costs and other charges 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company decided to restructure the operations of its aplio subsidiary 
in connection with this decision  the company wrote off substantially all of aplio s intangible and fixed assets as their values would not be recoverable  resulting in a charge of approximately million 
in addition  the company accrued approximately million for payments relating to the aplio settlement agreements 
the company recorded an additional charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to possible aplio employee terminations 
in addition  the company wrote off certain advertising agreements of approximately million as well as intangible and fixed assets of million  which were required based on the company s review of its business plan  as no future benefits are expected from these assets and commitments 
non cash compensation 
we recognized significant charges relating to non cash executive compensation expense in fiscal and fiscal and will recognize additional significant charges on an ongoing basis  in connection with the grants of options to purchase shares of our common stock  modification of our stock option plans and the sale of subsidiary restricted stock 
as a percentage of total revenue  non cash compensation expense was percent in fiscal as compared to percent in fiscal loss from operations 
loss from operations was approximately million for fiscal as compared to loss from operations of approximately million for fiscal excluding the non cash compensation charge  the one time non recurring termination costs and restructuring costs and other charges described above  our loss from operations for fiscal and fiscal would have been million and million  respectively

net income loss we have experienced growth in total revenue in each quarter since inception  reflecting greater acceptance and usage of our products and services by our expanded customer base 
we expect our revenue to grow over time as use of our service increases 
we continue to explore and evaluate new lines of business that are profitable 
as a result of our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete  we are unable to accurately forecast our revenue and direct cost of revenue as they may be impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors include the level of use of the internet as a communications medium  capacity constraints  the amount and timing of our capital expenditures  introduction of new services by us or our competitors  price competition  technical difficulties or system downtime  and the development of regulatory restrictions 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we generated negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately million during the fiscal  compared with negative cash flow from operating activities of million during fiscal the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily caused by an increase in the net loss before depreciation and amortization  non cash compensation expense  an increase in prepaid and other assets  and the write down of equity investments 
net cash used in investing activities decreased from million during fiscal  to million for fiscal capital expenditures increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  as we expanded our domestic and international network infrastructure 
in addition  the net cash from the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities was approximately million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal in august  we purchased  shares of common stock of speechworks international  inc for approximately million and acquired  shares of predictive networks  inc series c convertible preferred stock for approximately million 
in november  we purchased  shares of heyanita  inc series b preferred stock for approximately million 
in december  we purchased  shares of locationet systems ltd 
common stock for approximately million and acquired  shares of millicom italia common stock for approximately million 
in december  we acquired  shares of alonet sa common stock for approximately million in cash and converted loans of million due from alonet sa net cash provided by financing activities increased from million during fiscal  to approximately million for fiscal we received approximately million in net proceeds related to the sale of common stock to a subsidiary of at t in august and received approximately million in a private placement of preferred stock for adir technologies  inc  a subsidiary of netphone 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized a new share buyback program through which the we may repurchase up to five million shares of common stock in the open market 
as of july   we had repurchased  shares under this program  utilizing approximately million in cash 
we believe that  based upon our present business plan  our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months 
effects of inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation over the last several years  inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that is completed after june  sfas no 
no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we plan to early adopt sfas no 
effective august  and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
subsequent events on august   adir acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of netspeak corporation netspeak  a florida corporation through the merger of a tech merger sub  inc  a florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of adir  with and into netspeak 
as consideration adir  paid an aggregate of million for the acquisition 
adir raised an aggregate of million from its existing shareholders specifically for the acquisition of netspeak 
in october  idt entered into an agreement to lead a consortium that would concentrate ownership of approximately in us and voting power 
the consortium consists of idt  liberty media corporation liberty  and at t 
as part of the agreement  idt and at t contributed their shares of our class a common stock approximately million and million shares  respectively to a newly formed limited liability company llc 
liberty then acquired a substantial portion of the llc s units from at t  while idt increased its stake and at t retained a reduced but still significant interest 
idt will be the managing member of the llc 
immediately thereafter  howard s 
jonas  chairman of idt corporation  became our chief executive officer and four new persons were added to our board of directors 
it is too early at this time to know whether any significant changes will be made in our current business strategy as described above as a result of the concentration of majority voting power in us into a single shareholder 
the events of september   additional threatened terrorist acts  and the ongoing military action have created uncertainties in our industry as well as domestic and international economies in general 
these events  and potential future terrorist acts  may result in reduced demand from our clients for our services and products and may potentially have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
it is too soon  however  for us to reasonably estimate the impact of these tragic events on our industry and our future financial performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments such as investments and debt that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we are not exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
as of july   we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes
