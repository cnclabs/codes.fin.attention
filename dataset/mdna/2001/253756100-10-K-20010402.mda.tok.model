located in london  our european smartcenter sm gives digex customers in europe the superior level of technology  security  and support services in europe they have come to rely on in the united states 
the data center is a leased facility which became operational in july we recently completed two rigorous assessments of our operating environment 
these assessments included a type ii review based on the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa s statement on auditing standards no 
sas  and the ernst young cyber process certification 
these reviews examined digex s managed data center facilities in three locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
sas was established by the aicpa to provide a basis for examinations of the internal controls of service organizations related to financial transaction processing 
digex had successfully completed a sas type i review in may the type ii review which requires testing of controls by the auditing firm was conducted by ernst young for the period july  through december  also  ernst young s cyber process certification evaluated and tested the design and operational effectiveness of controls to achieve the objectives specified in the report  related to digex s web hosting services 
both reviews focused on the control environment which govern the company s  physical security  electronic security measures  customer server infrastructure  implementation  and maintenance  network services and problem management  and business continuity 
in february  we successfully completed the type ii review and the cyber process certification for the six month period july  to december  on june   we entered into an asset migration agreement with intermedia 
under the terms of the agreement  we purchased certain assets  including certain licensed third party software  machinery  and equipment from intermedia at cost to provide independent managed firewall services

under the asset migration agreement  we made equal monthly installments amounting to million for intermedia s support and consultation for the six month period ended december  in connection with the purchase of firewall related assets from intermedia  the managed firewall services agreement between digex and intermedia was terminated 
on june   we entered into a ten year lease commencing in september for our new corporate headquarters facility in laurel  maryland 
the lease agreement requires an initial security deposit of million in the form of a letter of credit 
this letter of credit may be reduced at the commencement of the seventh lease year to an amount equal to the then current one month s base rent if certain conditions are met annually prior to the seventh year of the lease

through the arrangement  we will be able to connect our internet data centers in the us to the worldcom global ip network that runs through north america  south america  europe  asia  and australia with over  points of presence 
we will also utilize worldcom s sales force to enhance its global presence 
revenue 
our revenues consist primarily of monthly fees from our managed web and application hosting services 
contracts for these services are typically between one and three years in length 
in addition to web and application hosting  we also offer enterprise services and consulting services and believe that we will begin to derive increasing amounts of revenues from the sale of these services in the future 
revenue earned from the sale of third party equipment is also included 
costs and expenses 
costs and expenses include cost of operations  cost of services  selling  general and administrative expenses  deferred compensation  and depreciation and amortization expense 
cost of operations consist primarily of the costs for our network connectivity and firewall services 
we expect our network connectivity requirements to grow in conjunction with the growth of our overall business  including the expansion of our business abroad through our wholly owned subsidiaries  and accordingly expect these costs to increase in the future 
expenses directly attributed to the sale of third party equipment is also included 
cost of services consist primarily of facilities administration expenses including rent  maintenance and utilities to support our data centers and salaries and related benefits for our technical operations 
we expect our cost of services to increase in dollar amount but to decline as a percentage of revenue due to economies of scale and expected improvements in technology and productivity 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our marketing  sales and support personnel  advertising costs  consultants fees  provision for doubtful accounts and other miscellaneous expenses 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar amount and to decline as a percentage of revenue over time 
deferred compensation expense relates to stock options that were granted by digex to certain employees at exercise prices below market value 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of our data centers  servers and related equipment and amortization of our intangible assets 
we expect these expenses to increase due to our plans to invest significant capital to continue to expand our data center capacity 
plan of operation we plan to expand our web and application hosting business by focusing on large companies which are looking to develop a presence on the internet by both providing e commerce business solutions to their customers and outsourcing the management of their web sites and web enabled business applications 
in the fourth quarter of  we opened our state of the art data centers on the east and west coasts of the united states 
our first international data center  located in london  was operational in july we anticipate that these data centers  when operating at full capacity  will support servers generating in excess of million in annualized revenue 
we believe that the new data centers in the united states and those we continue to develop internationally will place us in a stronger competitive position to successfully provide outsourced solutions of scalable managed web and application hosting solutions 
we also offer value added services  such as firewall management  stress testing  and consulting services  including capacity and migration planning and database optimization  and believe that we will derive increasing amounts of revenue from these services in the future 
our commercial agreements with worldcom will allow us to purchase bandwidth and connectivity from worldcom in the united states and around the globe to support our managed web hosting activities 
through the arrangements  we will be able to connect our internet data centers in the us to the worldcom global ip network that runs through north america  south america  europe  asia  and australia with over  points of presence

in addition  ebitda before certain charges is not a term defined by generally accepted accounting principles and as a result our measure of ebitda before certain charges might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
however  we believe that ebitda before certain charges is relevant and useful information which is often reported and widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in the web and application hosting industry 
accordingly  we are disclosing this information to permit a more comprehensive analysis of our operating performance  as an additional meaningful measure of performance and liquidity  and to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements

see the financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report for more detailed information 
liquidity and capital resources we have used cash in our operating and investing activities during all periods since inception 
these cash usages have been funded by permanent contributions to capital from intermedia 
such contributions amounted to million in and million in since the date of our initial public offering  there have been no permanent capital contributions made by intermedia 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in net cash used for operating activities in each of these periods was primarily the result of operating losses and changes in working capital 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  million in  and million in net cash used for investing activities in each of these periods was primarily the result of capital expenditures for data center infrastructure which includes servers purchased for customer use  as well as leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computers and other equipment  including a million letter of credit pursuant to a ten year lease entered into by us on june  for our new corporate headquarters facility in laurel  maryland 
although we have plans to invest significantly in property and equipment  we have no material commitments for such items at this time 
prior to the date of our initial public offering  our capital expenditures and operating expenses were principally funded by intermedia 
on august   we sold  shares of class a common stock in our initial public offering 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
on january   we sold  shares of our series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of class a common stock to microsoft and a subsidiary of compaq for aggregate gross proceeds of million  of which million was paid in cash and million was paid in the form of equipment credits from compaq 
the preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of million and is convertible into approximately  shares of class a common stock 
the warrants can be exercised at any time over their three year term at a price of per share the fair value of our class a common stock on the transaction commitment date 
to the extent necessary to perform our obligations under our agreement with compaq  the proceeds from the investment by a subsidiary of compaq will be used toward the development of a platform for the delivery of high performance application hosting services  which will include capital expenditures and research and development expenditures 
therefore  we do not expect the proceeds of the investment by a subsidiary of compaq to be available for general corporate purposes 
we also intend to use the proceeds of the investment by microsoft to fund this development project 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of our class a common stock 
we sold  shares of class a common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
intermedia sold  shares of class b common stock 
the class b common stock sold by intermedia automatically converted into class a common stock at the closing of the offering 
the net proceeds of our public offerings and the cash proceeds of the investments by microsoft and compaq were used to purchase telecommunications related assets due to restrictions in intermedia s debt instruments 
therefore  to provide for the funding of our operating expenses  we made arrangements with intermedia to sell to intermedia certain telecommunications related assets that were purchased by digex with the net proceeds of these offerings 
the assets were sold to intermedia for cash at our cost 
we received approximately million in and million in from intermedia related to the sale of telecommunications related assets 
these proceeds were unrestricted and were used to fund our operating expenses 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters use of proceeds from a sale of registered securities 
in june  the department of business and economic development of maryland received approval from the maryland general assembly legislative policy committee to provide million in funding to digex for the development of a web hosting facility in prince george s county  maryland under the sunny day fund initiative 
the funds will initially be provided to us in the form of a conditional loan which will accrue deferred interest at 
if certain conditions are met  the conditional loan and accrued interest will be forgiven 
the committee also approved our eligibility to seek an additional million in such funding on or after january  if certain conditions are met 
we received the proceeds from the million conditional loan in january in accordance with the digex long term incentive plan  stock options granted to certain employees of digex and intermedia became vested and exercisable beginning in the second quarter of cash proceeds of million were received from exercised stock options during the year ended december  we may continue to receive cash proceeds from stock options in the future as an increasing number of options will become exercisable according to each optionee s respective vesting schedule 
on september   intermedia entered into a merger agreement with worldcom whereby  upon consummation of the merger  a subsidiary of worldcom will be merged with and into intermedia and intermedia will become a subsidiary of worldcom 
as a result of the merger  worldcom will beneficially own a majority of our capital stock and will have voting control of us 
the merger is expected to be consummated in the second quarter of see business recent developments 
on october   intermedia increased the commitments available to it under its revolving credit facility credit facility from million to million 
the credit facility is fully guaranteed by worldcom 
as a subsidiary of intermedia  we are a limited guarantor under the credit facility to the greater of million or the amounts borrowed by digex 
through intermedia  we expect to have access to the proceeds available under the credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures as liquidity needs arise consistent with our projections 
as of december   intermedia had million outstanding on its credit facility 
on october   intermedia also entered into a note purchase agreement with worldcom 
intermedia authorized the issue and sale of up to million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due and  shares of series h preferred stock 
through intermedia  we expect the proceeds from these financings will be available to fund our operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures as liquidity needs arise 
intermedia had not made any borrowings under these financings as of december  we expect to enter into a master lease and financing agreement with a vendor for a line of credit of up to million to facilitate the leasing of computer hardware and software in the future 
the initial term of the agreement ranges from to months 
we also have an option to purchase the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
after the anticipated closing of the intermedia worldcom merger  worldcom has agreed that it will provide funding to us for the performance of our and business plans as approved by the digex and worldcom boards of directors 
such funding will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus basis points and will be repayable over a four year period commencing in the terms of such funding are expected to contain conditions to borrowing  covenants and other terms that have not yet been negotiated but could restrict our access to the availability to such funds 
in addition  any changes to our business plans that requires increased funding would require the worldcom board of directors approval before worldcom would be obligated to fund any such increase 
we expect to continue experiencing negative cash flow from operating and investing activities due to our plans for expansion and the growth of our business 
we anticipate we will have significant cash requirements for several years as we expand our data center capacity  increase servers under management  increase our employee base  acquire additional office space to support our expanding operations and invest in our marketing organization 
in addition  we expect to invest significantly in the purchase of property and equipment and for research and development  including funding the expenses associated with our research and development alliance with microsoft and a subsidiary of compaq 
we expect our capital expenditures to increase due to the growth of servers under management and our continuing data center expansion in the united states and abroad 
with our existing cash resources and financing available from intermedia  we believe we have sufficient capital to sustain our current operations and capital expenditure plans into mid upon depletion of these financing sources  we intend to rely on worldcom for funding 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available on terms satisfactory to us 
in the event the intermedia worldcom merger does not close  our intention would be to access the capital markets for our necessary funding 
management has had preliminary discussions with third party sources regarding potential financing  including vendor financing facilities or other asset backed secured financing 
based on these discussions  management believes that we will have access to capital markets to obtain sufficient funding to continue our business plans as described above or  at a minimum  in an amount that would provide sufficient funding to execute a modified or curtailed plan into see risk factor the failure of the intermedia worldcom merger to close would adversely impact us 
intermedia is and will continue to be highly leveraged 
at december  and  intermedia had outstanding approximately billion and billion of debt and other liabilities including trade payables  respectively  and a total of approximately million and million of obligations with respect to the outstanding series of preferred stock  respectively 
in addition  as of december   intermedia borrowed million under its million credit facility 
intermedia has also entered into a million note purchase agreement with worldcom 
through intermedia  we expect the proceeds from these financings will be available to fund our operations  working capital needs and capital expenditures as liquidity needs arise 
intermedia s level of debt will require it to dedicate a substantial portion of its future cash flow from operations for payment of principal and interest on its debt  as well as dividends on and the redemption of its preferred stock 
historically  intermedia has not generated sufficient cash flow to cover its operating and investing expenses 
for the years ended december  and  intermedia s earnings were insufficient to cover combined fixed charges and dividends on preferred stock 
the auditors of intermedia have expressed in their opinion that while intermedia s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern  intermedia has incurred recurring operating losses and has a net capital deficiency  and as a result  these conditions raise substantial doubt about intermedia s ability to continue as a going concern 
information regarding forward looking statements the information set forth above in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including statements concerning the future outcome of litigation and the completion of the intermedia worldcom merger 
forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as estimates  projects  anticipates  expects  intends  believes  or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties

income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
at december   a full valuation allowance was provided on net deferred tax assets of million based upon our deficit in earnings and the uncertainty surrounding our ability to recognize such assets 
the valuation allowance relates primarily to a net operating loss carryforward 
income tax accounting information is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we expect to continue recognizing revenue from international sales denominated in foreign currency 
as a global concern  we could face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates on the financial results of foreign subsidiaries that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could affect our financial results 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currency risk and  as a result  could incur gains or losses 
while our long term note payable bears an effective fixed interest rate  the fair market value of our fixed rate long term note payable is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we run the risk that market rates will decline  and the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current risk management policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes
