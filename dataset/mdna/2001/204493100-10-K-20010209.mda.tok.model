effective january   compaq adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december compaq s adoption of sab resulted in a change in the method of accounting for certain product shipments 
the cumulative effect of this change was million million  net of tax 
this accounting change did not have a material effect on revenue or quarterly earnings during compaq has restated its results for the first three quarters of the year ended december   as reflected in the selected quarterly financial data on page enterprise computing enterprise computing revenue increased billion  or percent  in compared with the prior year and represented percent of consolidated revenue 
in  revenue from this segment increased billion  or percent  compared with enterprise computing revenue consisted of the following year ended december in millions industry standard servers    storage products    business critical servers    other industry standard servers revenue grew percent during compared with the prior year 
revenue benefited from higher average unit prices  which were aided by mid year component shortages and a richer server mix 
demand was strong across all regions as both corporate and internet service provider customers continued to build out their data centers 
revenue growth was strongest in the compaq proliant tm dense rack optimized server line as an increasing number of customers valued the simplicity and space saving economies provided by dense servers 
also  higher end server revenue was strong with solid sales in industry leading way and way servers 
in  industry standard servers revenue benefited from a higher market share in north america compared with storage products revenue increased percent during the year 
strong growth in enterprise storage  which consisted of external storage  software and high end tape  was offset by lower attached storage 
enterprise storage growth was driven by solid sales in software and strong acceptance of compaq s enterprise network storage architecture solutions 
revenue benefited from an increase in overall storage capacity shipped of percent to  terabytes during the year  partially offset by compaq alphaserver tm and proliant tm systems product revenue does not include attached and enterprise storage  which is captured in storage products 
aggressive price declines per unit of capacity 
storage products revenue growth in resulted primarily from the digital acquisition 
business critical servers revenue was essentially unchanged in compared with the prior year due to product transition to the compaq alpha tm gs series and related component shortages which have since been resolved 
the increase in business critical servers revenue in was primarily due to the acquisition of digital 
enterprise computing operating income increased million  or percent  in compared with the prior year due to strong revenue growth and higher gross margins  as well as lower operating expenses 
margins improved due to a mix shift toward the high end and increased enterprise storage 
strong demand for industry standard servers drove higher average unit prices 
operating expense declined in whole dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the enterprise computing segment due to a continued focus on cost control and expense reduction 
operating income improved in compared with due to stronger performance in storage products  a decline in operating expense as a percentage of revenue and a full year of digital business 
compaq global services compaq global services revenue decreased million  or percent  in compared with the prior year and represented percent of consolidated revenue 
compaq global services revenue consisted of the following year ended december in millions customer services    professional services    adjusted for the effects of currency  compaq global services revenue increased percent 
the decline in compaq global services revenue during the year was primarily a result of lower professional services revenue 
adjusted for the effects of currency  professional services revenue was essentially unchanged 
compaq has narrowed its focus for professional services to target areas of opportunity that are consistent with its internet related service strategy and continues to realign its workforce to support growth plans 
customer services revenue grew percent adjusted for the effects of currency  in line with the market 
such growth was aided by strong attachment of services with product sales and continued penetration of business critical services 
compaq global service revenue increased billion  or percent  in compared with  benefiting from a full year of the digital business acquired in june customer services benefited from significant growth in asia pacific  latin america and greater china  reflecting recovery from asian and latin american economic crises 
revenue also improved as a result of growth in software support and business critical services 
outsourcing business and e business strengths favorably impacted professional services revenue 
compaq global services operating income declined million  or percent  in compared with the prior year 
given the substantial portion of international business within compaq global services  currency declines significantly impacted operating income during while profitability in the customer services business remains strong  professional services operating results were lower primarily due to workforce rebalancing and reskilling 
operating expense increased primarily due to investment in direct sales capability 
operating income was higher in compared with primarily due to a full year of digital business 
compaq global services revenue includes revenue from the sale of products made in connection with providing solutions and services to customers 
commercial personal computing commercial personal computing revenue increased million  or percent  in compared with the prior year and represented percent of consolidated revenue 
revenue grew across all regions  benefiting from higher unit sales of portables and compaq ipaq tm products  offset in part by lower unit sales of desktops 
in  commercial personal computing revenue increased million  or percent  compared with overall unit sales growth in was partially offset by declining average unit prices  which were lower due to competitive pricing and a shift in product mix 
demand for portable products shifted from higher end mobility and power to lower cost during compaq completed the purchase of key assets from inacom during the first quarter of and subsequently established custom edge incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary also known as compaq direct 
this purchase adds custom configuration capabilities and direct fulfillment logistics that enable compaq to better meet customer needs in north america 
commercial personal computing operating income increased million  from a loss of million in to income of million in operating results strengthened dramatically due to continued improvement in the business model  including integration of compaq direct s fulfillment capacity  and successful reduction of operating costs 
profitability also benefited from a favorable shift in product mix to higher margin portables and supply chain efficiencies 
operating expense declined due to persistent focus on streamlining processes and increasing efficiencies 
commercial personal computing operating loss increased million in as compared with due primarily to lower gross margins which resulted from average unit prices falling faster than costs 
costs for processors  memory and hard drives for desktops and portables declined during the year 
gross margin also suffered from aggressive competitive bidding 
operating expenses declined slightly in as a percentage of revenue due to an increased focus on sales and marketing spending as well as support costs 
consumer consumer revenue increased billion  or percent  in compared with the prior year and accounted for percent of consolidated revenue 
consumer revenue benefited from strong international sales growth  particularly in asia pacific and latin america 
higher unit sales of desktops and portables also contributed to revenue growth 
the consumer segment continues to hold the number one worldwide consumer pc market share position according to international data corporation 
the beyond the box business  which includes internet access  internet traffic  printers  software  financing and warranty upgrades  increased percent compared with the prior year 
consumer revenue increased billion  or percent  in compared with revenue benefited from high unit growth driven by strong consumer demand  partially offset by a decline in average unit prices 
component costs continued to decline  which allowed compaq to reach lower price points  thus spurring consumer demand 
an increase in international sales also drove total revenue higher  particularly in latin america and asia pacific 
higher revenue from internet access and traffic benefited the consumer segment in consumer operating income declined million  or percent  in compared with the prior year 
the decline in operating income was primarily due to a downturn in the us consumer pc market that occurred late in the fourth quarter of higher component costs also contributed to lower operating income 
operating expenses were relatively unchanged as a percentage of revenue 
consumer operating income increased million  or percent  in compared with the increase in operating income was attributable to higher revenue  which resulted in higher gross margin in absolute dollars  and slightly lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
corporate and unallocated shared expenses the results of the business segments exclude separately managed corporate and unallocated shared expenses  which consisted primarily of general and administrative costs as well as other items not controlled by the business segments 
corporate and unallocated shared expenses declined from billion in to billion in corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased million in due to higher information management  acquisition integration and other general shared costs 
restructuring and related activities during  compaq substantially completed all of the actions contemplated under the and restructuring plans 
in december  compaq reversed excess reserves of million for employee separations  facility closure costs and other costs related to the plan 
accrued costs under both plans at december  included amounts for actions that have already been taken  but for which expenditures have not yet been made 
in september  compaq s management approved a restructuring plan to realign compaq s organization  reduce infrastructure and overhead  and eliminate excess and duplicative facilities 
restructuring and related charges of million million  net of tax were expensed 
these charges were composed of million of accrued restructuring costs  million of related asset impairment charges and a million pension curtailment loss to recognize a change in compaq s projected pension benefit obligation in connection with employee separations 
costs for employee separations related to approximately  employees worldwide affecting the majority of business functions  job classes and regions  predominantly occurring in north america and europe 
employee separation benefits include severance  medical and other benefits 
in june  compaq recorded a restructuring charge of approximately billion to integrate the operations of compaq and digital  consolidate duplicative facilities  improve service delivery and reduce overhead 
approximately billion was related to the acquisition of digital and recorded as a component of purchase accounting and million related to compaq and was charged to operations 
during  compaq also recorded a million charge related to asset impairments 
an analysis of the accrued costs and amounts charged against the provision follows expenditures beginning december  and december  in millions accrual expenditures adjustments plan employee separations facility closure costs contract cancellation and other exit costs plan employee separations  facility closure costs relocation other exit costs employee separations related to the and restructuring plans were  and  respectively  during total employee separations related to the and restructuring plans were  as of december  other income and expense other income and expense changed from income of billion in to a billion expense in  primarily due to a gain on sale of businesses recorded in and an investment impairment charge recorded in in august  compaq sold an percent equity interest in altavista for approximately million cmgi common shares  cmgi preferred shares convertible into million cmgi common shares and a million three year note receivable 
total consideration received from cmgi was valued at billion 
after adjusting for the net assets sold and for the expenses associated with the divestiture  compaq realized a gain of approximately billion million  net of tax 
compaq recorded a billion billion  net of tax impairment charge during for certain equity investments  principally compaq s cmgi investment  that were judged to have experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
excluding the investment impairment charge noted above  net investment income was million million  net of tax in compared with million million  net of tax in purchased in process technology as previously reported  upon consummation of the digital acquisition in june  compaq expensed approximately billion of purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
if these projects are not successfully developed  compaq s revenue and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
compaq is continually monitoring its development projects and as expected in the normal course of product development  certain projects have experienced delays and other projects are being evaluated due to changes in strategic direction and market conditions 
liquidity and capital resources compaq s cash and cash equivalents decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  the decrease resulted primarily from billion used in investing activities  offset in part by million and million provided by operating activities and financing activities  respectively 
net cash of million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items of billion  offset by billion used in working capital and other activities 
net cash used in working capital and other activities resulted primarily from an increase in receivables and other assets as well as cash payments for restructuring activities  partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities 
days sales outstanding were days and days for and  respectively 
from time to time  compaq may sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial 
accounts receivable sold were million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory turns were and in and  respectively 
net cash of billion used in investing activities resulted primarily from the following items 
compaq paid cash of million for the acquisition of inacom 
compaq also used cash of billion for capital expenditures  net of disposals 
cash of million was used in other investing activities 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities of million consisted primarily of increases in long term debt and short term borrowings of million and million  respectively  partially offset by common stock transactions of million and dividends paid to stockholders of million 
estimated future uses of cash in include capital expenditures for land  buildings and equipment of approximately billion  purchases of equipment to be leased to third parties of approximately million and approximately million for the repurchase of compaq common shares 
compaq also plans to use available liquidity to develop the purchased in process technology related to the digital acquisition into commercially viable products 
at december   the estimated costs to be incurred to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products totaled approximately billion in the aggregate through the year million in  million in  million in and million in compaq currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
compaq has a billion revolving credit facility that expires in september and a billion revolving credit facility that expires in october the facilities bear interest at libor plus percent and libor plus percent  respectively 
both of these facilities were unused at december  and compaq also operates two short term commercial paper programs a billion program in the name of compaq computer corporation and a billion program in the name of compaq financial services corporation cfs 
both programs are supported by the billion credit facility 
outstanding commercial paper reduces available borrowings under this credit facility 
at december   compaq had million and million in commercial paper outstanding under the compaq and cfs programs  respectively  with a weighted average interest rate of percent 
the carrying amounts of the borrowings under the commercial paper programs approximate their fair value 
additionally  compaq maintains various uncommitted lines of credit  which totaled approximately million at december  there were no outstanding borrowings against these lines at december  and compaq believes that these sources of credit provide sufficient financial flexibility to meet future funding requirements 
compaq continually evaluates the need to establish other sources of working capital and will pursue those it considers appropriate based upon its needs and market conditions 
compaq filed a billion shelf registration statement for debt securities with the securities and exchange commission during the second quarter of in august  compaq placed under the registration statement million of unsecured percent notes that mature on august   and million of unsecured percent notes that mature on august  collectively  the notes  unless previously redeemed 
interest will be paid on the notes on february and august of each year  beginning on february  the fair value of the notes approximates carrying value 
the financing is for general corporate purposes including investments in cfs and other subsidiaries  capital expenditures  and repayment of outstanding indebtedness including commercial paper issued for working capital purposes 
compaq has the capacity to issue an additional billion of debt securities under the shelf registration statement 
factors that may affect future results compaq participates in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by intense industry wide competition 
industry participants confront aggressive pricing practices by competitors  continually changing customer demand patterns and rapid technological developments 
the following cautionary statements discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this annual report 
component shortages could curtail production 
from time to time  supply for key components in compaq s products lags behind worldwide demand 
in the event that supply of a key material component is delayed or curtailed  compaq s ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected 
compaq attempts to mitigate the risks of component shortages by working closely with key suppliers on product plans  coordinated product introductions  purchases on the spot market and selected strategic purchases 
delays in implementation of changes in delivery models could negatively affect financial results 
compaq sells directly to end users in all market sectors  but the largest proportion of direct sales is in large enterprise accounts 
products in commercial personal computing are sold primarily through third party resellers while products in consumer are sold principally through retail outlets 
as compared to compaq  many compaq competitors sell a higher percentage of their personal computer products directly to end user customers 
direct sales may afford such competitors an advantage that will allow them to price products lower than compaq s products are priced or to compete on terms of service that compaq cannot match 
compaq has established a variety of programs designed to achieve similar operational capabilities by simplifying its product set and pricing model  re engineering the channel delivery model and more rapidly expanding e commerce capabilities for large  medium and small businesses 
competitive environment places pressure on revenue  gross margins and market share 
competition remains intense in the information technology industry with a large number of competitors vying for customers and market share  domestically and internationally 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment  which continues to put pressure on revenue  gross margins and market share  which is particularly acute during market slowdowns 
unanticipated delays in product schedules could affect product demand 
the process of developing new high technology products and services is complex and often uncertain 
successful product transitions and deployment of new products requires accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix  customer demand and configuration 
compaq may also anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the product s realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
further  in the face of intense competition in the industry  any delay in a new product rollout could decrease any advantage compaq may have to be the first to market 
a failure on the part of compaq to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated and in the quantities appropriately matching current customer demand could directly affect the future demand for the product and the profitability of compaq s operations 
new form factors introduce uncertainty into the market 
the increasing reliance on the internet is creating new dynamics in the computer industry 
as businesses and consumers turn to the internet  speed and connectivity may become more critical than stand alone power for client devices 
compaq is introducing a new generation of internet devices built around simple form factors  customized functions and wireless mobility 
compaq s products will vie for customer acceptance and market share against those of computer companies as well as consumer electronics and telecommunications companies 
hardware products  which are compaq s traditional area of strength  may become less important than service offerings in attracting and retaining customers 
in addition  as new form factors are adopted  sales of traditional personal computers may decline 
changes in the services business could adversely affect earnings 
compaq s global services business has traditionally provided services that included the design and implementation of high end proprietary systems 
if the trend for design and implementation of systems continues to move from proprietary environments to industry standard products  compaq will need to continue and accelerate retraining its services personnel to compete in the new environment 
there can be no assurance that compaq will be able to successfully continue training  attracting and retaining the necessary personnel to achieve this transition as compaq adapts its service practices to changing conditions 
competition for talented employees could hamper business operations 
compaq  like all technology companies  must compete for talented employees in a market where the demand for such individuals exceeds the number of qualified candidates 
as a result  compaq s human resources organization focuses significant efforts on attracting and retaining individuals in key technology positions internationally 
these efforts have generated positive results in terms of both reducing attrition rates and filling openings created by prior employee losses 
declining stock market prices  however  make retention more difficult as prior equity grants contain less value and key employees pursue equity opportunities elsewhere 
should compaq experience a substantial loss of talent or an inability to attract talent for key openings  particularly in critical markets  the resulting talent gaps could impact compaq s ability to meet its business objectives 
credit risks could increase if financial condition of resellers or equipment lessees erodes 
much of compaq s revenue results from selling products through distributors and resellers 
compaq continually monitors and manages the credit it extends to distributors and resellers and attempts to limit credit risks by utilizing risk transfer arrangements and obtaining security interests 
the industry s trend from indirect sales models to direct sales models may reduce the market opportunities for the number of distributors or resellers in the market 
compaq s business could be adversely affected in the event that the financial condition of its distributors and resellers erodes 
upon the financial failure of a distributor or reseller  compaq could experience disruptions in distribution as well as a loss associated with the unsecured portion of any outstanding accounts receivable 
additionally  through its wholly owned subsidiary  cfs  compaq provides information technology leasing and financing solutions to customers 
as a consequence  compaq is exposed to the risk that lessees will be unable to make required lease payments and to the risk that leased equipment will be worth less upon its return to compaq than was estimated at lease inception 
while compaq believes that its allowances for credit losses are adequate and that its estimates of the residual value of leased equipment are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such allowances will cover actual losses or that estimated residual values will be realized 
delays in new systems implementation could hamper operational efficiency 
compaq continues to focus on increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of its business and information management processes to increase customer satisfaction  improve productivity and lower costs 
in  compaq is focusing on improvements required to support more direct sales and changes in manufacturing supply chain operations 
efforts to improve systems infrastructure and increase system security could be hampered by the need to balance increased operational efficiency against budgetary constraints 
delays in implementing further improvements could adversely affect inventory levels  cash and related profitability 
quarterly sales cycle makes planning and operational efficiencies difficult 
compaq  like other computer companies  generally sells more products in the third month of each quarter than in the first and second months 
this sales pattern places pressure on manufacturing and logistics systems based on internal forecasts and may adversely affect compaq s ability to predict its financial results accurately 
in addition  to rationalize manufacturing utilization  compaq may build products early in the quarter in anticipation of demand late in the quarter 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated product demand  a systems failure  or component pricing movements  can adversely impact inventory levels  cash and related profitability in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 
minority investments could adversely affect liquidity and earnings 
compaq holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within compaq s strategic focus 
some of these investments are in research and development  start up or development stage companies or companies where operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as going concerns 
as a result  compaq may be called upon under contractual or other terms to provide funding for operations of such companies and may share in the losses of such entities 
certain investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are highly volatile 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in compaq incurring losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of its investments 
doing business in certain locations creates additional risks 
manufacturing operations in developing countries  such as brazil and china  and the expansion of sales into economically volatile areas such as asia pacific  latin america and other emerging markets  subject compaq to a number of economic and other risks  such as financial instability among resellers in these regions and the volatility of economic conditions in countries that are dependent on exports from the us and european markets 
compaq generally has experienced longer accounts receivable cycles in emerging markets  in particular asia pacific and latin america  when compared with us and european markets 
compaq is also subject to any political and financial instability in the countries in which it operates  including inflation  recession  currency devaluation and interest rate fluctuations 
compaq continues to monitor its business operations in these regions and takes various measures to manage risks in these areas 
expense constraints could impede operations 
compaq is focused on bringing its operational expense to appropriate levels for each of its businesses while simultaneously implementing extensive new programs 
the significant risks associated with these actions include the failure to expend sufficient revenue generating advertising and marketing funds  unanticipated consequences of reductions in personnel devoted to ongoing programs  and the failure to meet operating expense targets by not matching commitments in new programs to reductions in ongoing programs 
income taxes 
compaq anticipates an effective tax rate of percent for compaq s manufacturing entity in singapore is subject to a tax holiday that is not expected to extend beyond compaq s tax rate has historically been heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings derived from its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary and its ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
if compaq s intercompany transfer pricing with respect to its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary for prior years require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  compaq s overall tax rate could increase 
at december   compaq had a deferred tax asset of million related to net operating loss carryforwards which  if not utilized  will generally expire between and and credit carryforwards of approximately billion  which  if not utilized  will generally expire between and compaq had a valuation allowance of million as of december  against the net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
compaq has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event compaq were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
currency fluctuations 
compaq s risks associated with currency fluctuations are discussed in item a below 
item a 
market risk s compaq is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
compaq attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing derivatives and other financial instruments 
compaq uses market valuations and value at risk valuation methods to assess the market risk of its financial instruments and derivative portfolios 
it uses software by riskmetrics to estimate the value at risk of its financial instruments and derivative portfolios based on estimates of volatility and correlation of market factors drawn from riskmetrics data sets for the dates calculated 
riskmetrics defines loss as a reduction in the value of a portfolio in the event of adverse market conditions  using a predetermined confidence interval  over a specified period of time 
compaq included all fixed income investments  interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange contracts in the value at risk calculation 
see note and note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these instruments 
the holding period for these instruments varies from one day to nine months  with the exception of instruments held by cfs which have holding periods up to four years 
the measured value at risk from holding derivative and other financial instruments  using a percent confidence level and assuming normal market conditions during the years ended december  and  was immaterial 
the value of the us dollar affects compaq s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect compaq s revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and retained earnings as expressed in us dollars 
compaq engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations 
compaq primarily uses forward exchange contracts to hedge those assets and liabilities that impact the income statement when remeasured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for some markets  compaq has determined that ongoing hedging of non us dollar net monetary assets is not cost effective and instead attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through working capital management 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially if a significant and sudden decline occurs in the value of local currencies 
compaq purchases foreign currency option contracts from time to time as well as short term forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the anticipated revenues of compaq s international marketing subsidiaries  with the exception of certain subsidiaries that reside in countries in which such activity would not be cost effective or local regulations preclude this type of activity 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of compaq s hedging programs include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all currency contracts that are entered into by compaq are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation 
although compaq maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  compaq s revenues or costs are adversely affected when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which compaq sells products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which compaq incurs costs 
changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on compaq s cash equivalents and short term investments  and interest expense on short term borrowings 
compaq does not enter into derivative transactions related to its cash  cash equivalents or short term investments 
compaq does periodically enter into interest rate swap transactions for the purpose of hedging existing or anticipated liabilities 
all interest rate swaps entered into by compaq are for the sole purpose of hedging existing or anticipated interest rate sensitive positions  not for speculation 
compaq is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of investments in publicly traded equity securities 
these investments are generally in companies having operations or technology in areas within compaq s strategic focus 
compaq does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
as of december   the fair value of compaq s available for sale investments was million 
a percent adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of compaq s available for sale securities as of december  because of the foregoing factors factors that may affect future results and market risks  as well as other variables affecting compaq s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods
