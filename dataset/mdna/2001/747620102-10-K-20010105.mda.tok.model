the results of the tubing operations have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
for business segment reporting purposes  these businesses were previously classified as steel tubes 
two small divisions  heat treat division and nitrosteel division  which were previously included with this segment  were retained by the company and are now included in the engineered steel bars segment 
in october  the company acquired the stock of decatur aluminum corp  a decatur  alabama based aluminum sheet manufacturer for approximately million 
the newly acquired company has been renamed nichols aluminum alabama  inc nichols aluminum alabama in alignment with quanex s other aluminum mill sheet businesses in its nichols aluminum division

business segments business segments are reported in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
during the fiscal third quarter ended july   internal management structure changes were made to increase the emphasis and focus on two separate lines of business 
these changes affected the way in which operating decisions are made and performance is assessed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the industry segment disclosure has been revised to reflect these changes and the previously reported engineered products segment has been split 
piper impact  which includes piper impact  the two new albany  mississippi based facilities  as well as piper impact europe until it was sold in july  has been separated out of the engineered products segment into a separate reporting segment named piper impact 
the engineered products segment now reflects the results of amsco  homeshield fabricated products and imperial fabricated products 
previous year s information has also been restated to reflect this change 
as such  the company has four reportable segments engineered steel bars  aluminum mill sheet products  engineered products and piper impact 
the engineered steel bar segment consists of engineered steel bars manufacturing  steel bar and tube heat treating services and steel bar and tube wear and corrosion resistant finishing services 
the aluminum mill sheet segment manufactures mill finished and coated aluminum sheet 
the engineered products segment manufactures aluminum window and patio door screens  window frames  exterior door components and other roll formed products and stamped shapes 
the piper impact segment manufactures impact extruded aluminum and steel parts

prior data has not been restated above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
fiscal results include nichols aluminum golden operations since the acquisition date of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal results include imperial fabricated products operations acquired april  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal results include the one time million loss on the sale of piper impact europe and million asset impairment charge relating to piper impact facilities in new albany  mississippi 
see note and to the consolidated financial statements 
the engineered steel bar business posted record annual net sales while working on its phase v capital expansion program which was completed in december operating income  however  was down from the previous year due largely to higher outside processing and raw material costs as well as higher depreciation charges 
phase v will raise the annual shipping capacity to  tons at macsteel and  tons at the heat treat facility 
also  work has begun at both mills for phase vi  which will increase their macplus capacity  our highest value added product line 
the aluminum mill sheet business had a record year in both net sales and operating income 
these records resulted from the acquisition of nichols aluminum golden  operational advancements throughout the division and healthy margins 
some of the operational advancements include the results of the new rotary furnaces at the casting facility in davenport  iowa  penetration into more value added markets and the improvements accomplished in quality and delivery performance 
the engineered products business had increased net sales and operating income  largely as a result of the acquisition of imperial fabricated products 
with this acquisition  the company was able to add new customers and new markets 
piper impact s results have been adversely impacted by declining aluminum air bag product sales and higher manufacturing costs associated with new product development as well as cellular manufacturing implementation 
while piper impact is aggressively developing new products that it hopes will replace the declining aluminum air bag components business  the results are slow 
piper made good progress in the second half of the year reducing its costs and these efforts are continuing 
in view of the losses experienced and the anticipated future erosion in the volume of aluminum airbag components at piper impact  an impairment charge was taken in the fourth quarter 
see note to the financial statements 
the impairment charge represents another step in the company s process of evaluating strategic alternatives for this business  including its possible sale 
outlook the company s first fiscal quarter is historically its least profitable quarter of each year as there are fewer production days and the company s customers experience holiday shutdowns 
additionally  the business outlook for quanex s first fiscal quarter finds the company s transportation and housing markets slowing significantly from fiscal levels 
however  because of the acquisitions made since january and the expected operational improvements at piper impact  the company anticipates  at this time  a modest impact from the slowdown in these markets on overall net sales and operating income in the first fiscal quarter of compared to the same period last year 
the company currently expects that the overall business levels for the balance of fiscal year should be similar to those experienced during domestic and global market factors will continue to impact the company and any further slowdown in the us economy would affect demand and pricing for many of the company s products 
continuing global pricing pressures in the engineered steel bar business and reduced demand for aluminum airbag components in the piper impact business offer significant challenges to our operations in maintaining operating margins 
improvement in financial results will depend upon  among other things  whether the strength of the economy improves  together with the markets which the company serves  successful new product development efforts at the piper impact business and whether the fiscal margin levels at aluminum mill sheet products can be sustained

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure the following discussion of the company and its subsidiaries exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and metal commodity prices as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
for a description of the company s significant accounting policies associated with these activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries have a revolving credit facility  convertible subordinated debentures  interest rate swap agreements and other long term debt which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at october  and  the company had fixed rate debt totaling and million  respectively 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the conversion feature of the company s subordinated debentures makes it impractical to estimate the effect of a hypothetical change in interest rates 
this is due to the correlation between the market value of these instruments and the market value of the company s common stock 
in general  any changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries floating rate obligations total and million at october  and  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the exposure of these obligations to increases in short term interest rates is limited by interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company 
these swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on all of the company s variable rate debt  thus limiting the potential impact that increasing interest rates would have on earnings 
under these swap agreements  payments are made based on a fixed rate million at  and million at and received on a libor based variable rate and at october  and  respectively 
at october  and  the unrealized losses related to the interest rate swap agreements are thousand and million 
if the floating rates were to change by from october levels  the fair market value of these swaps would change by approximately and million as of october  and  respectively 
however  it should be noted that any change in value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company utilized a range forward zero cost agreement to protect its initial equity investment in its netherlands subsidiary  piper impact europe  from fluctuations in us dollar dutch guilder exchange rates 
this agreement  which was entered into with a major financial institution  had a notional value of million guilders 
by establishing minimum and maximum exchange rates  this agreement limited the potential devaluation of the company s initial investment in its subsidiary while also limiting any potential appreciation 
during the third quarter ended july   the company sold the piper impact europe subsidiary 
as such  this range forward agreement was closed  realizing a gain of approximately million 
this gain was offset against the loss on the sale of piper impact europe  as the investment in piper impact europe was the underlying hedged item 
at october   the company booked a gain to stockholder s equity of thousand 
commodity price risk in the normal course of business  the company enters into long term firm price aluminum sheet sales contracts 
in order to hedge the risk of higher prices for the anticipated aluminum purchases required to fulfill these long term contracts  the company enters into long futures positions 
at october  and  the company had open futures contracts for aluminum pounds with fair values of and million  respectively 
the contracts had unrealized losses of thousand and unrealized gains of thousand at october  and  respectively  and covered a notional volume of  and  pounds of aluminum  respectively 
a hypothetical change from the october  and average london metal exchange lme ingot price of 
and  respectively  per pound would increase or decrease the unrealized pretax gains losses related to these contracts by approximately million and thousand  respectively 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the cost of purchased aluminum scrap
