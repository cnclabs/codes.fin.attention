    item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  as well as the quarterly financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview interwoven was incorporated in march to provide software products and services for web content management 
our products allow large teams of people across an enterprise to contribute and edit web content on a collaborative basis  reducing the time to web for critical ebusiness initiatives 
from march through march  we were a development stage company conducting research and development for our initial products 
in may  we shipped the first version of our principal product  teamsite 
we have subsequently developed and released enhanced versions of teamsite and have introduced related products 
as of december   we had sold our products and services to over customers 
we market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force and augment our sales efforts through relationships with systems integrators and other strategic partners 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california and maintain additional offices in the metropolitan areas of atlanta  boston  chicago  dallas  los angeles  new york city  san francisco  seattle and washington  dc our revenues to date have been derived primarily from accounts in north america 
in addition  we have offices in australia  brazil  canada  france  hong kong  japan  mexico  netherlands  united kingdom  singapore and sweden 
we had employees as of december  we derive revenues from the license of our software products and from services we provide to our customers 
to date  we have derived the majority of our license revenues from licenses of teamsite 
license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered  no significant post delivery obligations remain  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
services revenues consist of professional services and maintenance fees 
professional services primarily consist of software installation and integration  business process consulting and training 
we generally bill our professional services customers on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as the services are performed 
maintenance agreements are typically priced based on a percentage of the product license fee  and typically have a one year term that is renewable annually 
services provided to customers under maintenance agreements include technical product support and an unspecified number of product upgrades as released by us during the term of a maintenance agreement 
revenues from maintenance support agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
consistent with authoritative guidance on revenue recognition  we assess the probability of collection on all software license agreements and defer revenue when collection is not probable 
from inception through the fourth quarter of  the limited collection history and infancy of our international sales infrastructure lead to us to defer revenue until cash collection for sales occurring outside the united states 
we now believe that a more mature sales infrastructure coupled with a history of collections in several geographic regions allows us to ascertain that collections are probable in northern europe 
therefore  beginning on january   we will recognize revenue upon the signing of the contract and shipment of the product in northern europe 
we will continue to assess probability of collections on an individual agreement by agreement basis 
further  we will continually assess the appropriateness of revenue recognition on sales agreements in other geographic locations once we have developed an adequate infrastructure and collection history in those regions 
as of december   million in deferred revenue consisted of million related to maintenance and million related to services or licenses that had no ongoing obligation  of which million was international 
at december   the amount deferred until cash collection that related to northern europe was approximately million 
we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and services organizations  and to establish our administrative organization 
as a result  we have incurred net losses through the quarter ending december  and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we anticipate that our cost of services revenues and operating expenses in absolute dollars will increase substantially in the future as we grow our services organization to support an increased level and expanded number of services offered  increase our sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund greater levels of research and development  and improve our operational and financial systems 
accordingly  we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our operations 
in addition  our limited operating history and the weakness of the current economic environment generally makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
we have generally made business decisions with reference to net profit metrics excluding non cash charges  for example  acquisition and stock based compensation charges 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions  incur stock based compensation and intangible amortization charges  which will increase our losses inclusive of these non cash expenses 
we acquired a total of four corporations in and lexington software associates  inc  neonyoyo inc  ajuba solutions inc  and metacode technologies  inc under us generally accepted accounting principles  we have accounted for the four business combinations using the purchase method of accounting and recorded the market value of our common stock and options issued in connection with them and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of acquiring these entities 
that cost is allocated among the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as goodwill  in process research and development  acquired technology  acquired workforce and convenants not to compete  based on their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets to goodwill 
the impact of purchase accounting on our operating results is significant 
the impact of these mergers and acquisitions resulted in acquisition related expenses of million for we have also recorded deferred compensation liabilities related to options assumed and shares issued to effect business combinations and options granted below fair market value associated with our initial public offering in october  in the amount of million in the following table reflects the prospective impact of deferred compensation costs and the annual amortization of purchased intangibles attributable to our mergers and acquisitions that have closed in the past two years in thousands intangible assets    stock based compensation     the future amortization expense related to the acquisitions and deferred stock based compensation may be accelerated as we assesses the value and useful life of the intangible assets from time to time

the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license services total revenues cost of revenues license services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock based compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets writeoff of in process research development total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense  net provision for income taxes net loss comparison of and revenues total revenues increased from million in to million in this increase reflects sales to a larger number of new customers and higher average sales price per customer 
the number of new customers increased from as of december  to over as of december  the average sales price per customer increased from approximately  to approximately  our ability to attract new customers was a result of our developing a larger and more experienced sales and marketing staff  which numbered persons as of december  and persons as of december  the increase in average sales price per customer was primarily a result of selling more user licenses in the average new order  and to a lesser extent  increased sales of optional software modules and price increases 
license 
license revenues increased from million in to million in license revenues represented and of total revenues in those periods 
this increase in license revenues reflects the same factors that caused total revenues to increase from period to period 
services 
services revenues increased from million in to million in services revenues represented and of total revenues in those periods 
the increase in services revenues reflects a million increase in professional services fees  a million increase in maintenance fees and a million increase in training fees 
the increased professional services and maintenance fees were generated by an expanded number of customers who licensed our products 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues includes expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and related documentation  and costs of licensing third party software sold in conjunction with our software products 
cost of license revenues increased from  for to million for cost of license revenues represented and of license revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in cost of license revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties paid to third party software vendors  and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in the volume of products shipped 
we expect cost of license revenues to increase in the future 
we expect cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenue to vary from period to period  depending upon the timing of payments to third party software vendors and amounts of license revenue recognized in each period 
services 
cost of services revenues consists primarily of salary and related costs of our professional services  training  maintenance and support personnel  as well as subcontractor expenses 
cost of services revenues increased from million for to million for cost of services revenues represented and of services revenues  respectively  in those periods 
this increase in cost of services revenues was attributable to an increase in the number of service employees from to  and to a million increase in subcontractor expenses 
we expect our cost of services revenues to increase for the foreseeable future as we expand our services staff and consulting organizations 
since services revenues have lower gross margins than license revenues  we expect this expansion to reduce our gross margins  unless our license revenues increase significantly 
we expect cost of services revenues as a percentage of services revenues to vary from period to period  depending on whether the services are performed by our employees or by subcontractors and on the overall use of our professional services staff 
furthermore  the blend of employees and sub contractors we use is affected by the mix of services we provide 
gross profit gross profit increased from million for to million for gross profit represented and of total revenues  respectively  in those periods 
this increase reflects the more rapid increase of license revenues compared to services revenues as our customer base has grown 
we expect to increase the capacity of our professional services organization to meet the demand for services from our customers 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of total revenues to fluctuate from period to period primarily as a result of changes in the relative proportion of license and services revenues and to a lesser extent  as a result of changes in the cost of license revenues and cost of service revenues 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses increased from million for to million for  representing and of total revenues in those periods  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in the number of our product development employees from to persons  to increased use of subcontractors  and to higher associated wages  salaries and recruitment costs 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects a higher growth rate in total revenues compared to the growth rate in research and development expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our strategic objectives  and we expect that the amounts of research and development expenses will increase in future periods 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by research and development expenses will fluctuate from period to period  depending primarily on timing of new hires and  to a lesser extent  on the size and timing of product development projects 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed in the period incurred  as the costs incurred after technological feasibility have been insignificant 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  as well as sales commissions  travel expenses and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for to million for  representing and of total revenues  respectively  in those periods 
this increase in sales and marketing expenses was caused by higher sales commissions and bonuses of million  increases in sales and marketing personnel costs of million  and increased marketing related costs of million 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects a higher growth rate in total revenues compared to the growth rate in sales and marketing expenses 
we expect that the dollar amounts of sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we seek to expand our customer base and increase brand awareness 
we also anticipate that the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate from period to period  depending on such factors as the timing of new hires on new marketing programs and the levels of revenues in each period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for accounting  human resources  legal and other administrative functions  as well as provisions for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for to million for  representing and of total revenues  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was caused by additional staffing of these functions to support expanded operations during this same period 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects a higher growth rate in total revenues  compared to the growth rate in general and administrative expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in as we add personnel to support expanding operations and incur other costs related to the growth of our business 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by general and administrative expenses will fluctuate from period to period  depending on such factors as the timing of new hires and the size and timing of expansion projects

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash provided by operating activities reflected decreasing net losses offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
during  our investing activities included purchases of property and equipment  principally computer hardware and software

during  our investing activities included purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments 
net purchases of investments were approximately million during as of december   except for our  investment in alterego networks in september  we had not invested in derivative securities or any other financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
we expect that  in the future  cash in excess of current requirements will continue to be invested in high credit quality  interest bearing securities 
during  our investing activities included the acquisitions of neonyoyo  metacode technologies and ajuba solutions 
the net cash paid in connection with these acquisitions was million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million

we intend to maintain the line of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all related financial covenants and restrictions under the line of credit 
we believe that the current cash  cash equivalents  investments and funds available under existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months

factors affecting future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
these risks are the ones we consider to be significant to your decision whether to invest in our common stock at this time 
we might be wrong 
there may be risks that you in particular view differently than we do  and there are other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  but that may in fact harm our business in the future 
if any of these risks occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating interwoven and our business 
our operating history is limited  so it will be difficult for you to evaluate our business in making an investment decision 
we were incorporated in march and have a limited operating history 
we are still in the early stages of our development  which makes the evaluation of our business operations and our prospects difficult 
we shipped our first product in may since that time  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from licensing our teamsite product and related products and services 
in evaluating our common stock  you should consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  particularly those companies whose businesses depend on the internet 
these risks and difficulties  as they apply to us in particular  include 
potential fluctuations in operating results and uncertain growth rates  
limited market acceptance of our products  
concentration of our revenues in a single product or family of products  
our dependence on an increasing number of large orders  
our need to expand our direct sales forces and indirect sales channels  
our need to manage rapidly expanding operations  
our need to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  
our need to establish and maintain strategic relationships with other companies  some of whom may in the future become our competitors  
our need to expand internationally  
our ability to integrate acquired businesses and technologies  
delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  
the size and timing of individual license transactions  
the appropriate mix of products and services sold  
our ability to develop and market new products and control costs  and 
changes in the economy and foreign exchange rates 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based upon the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
if we do not increase our license revenues significantly  we will fail to achieve and sustain operating profitability 
we have incurred net losses from operations in each quarter since our inception through the quarter ended september  our net losses amounted to million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we plan to expand our sales and marketing  research and development  and professional services organizations 
as a result  if we are to sustain operating profitability on a quarterly and annual basis  we will need to increase our revenues significantly  particularly our license revenues 
we cannot predict when we will become profitable  if at all 
our operating results fluctuate widely and are difficult to predict  so we may fail to satisfy the expectations of investors or market analysts and our stock price may decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we expect them to continue to fluctuate unpredictably in the future 
the main factors that may affect these fluctuations are 
the discretionary nature of our customer s purchase and budget cycles  
the size and complexity of our license transactions  
potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  
timing of new product releases  
sales force capacity  
seasonal variations in operating results  and 
variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or exceed the forecasts periodically disclosed by management or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
further  we anticipate that our sequential percentage rate of revenue growth will decline in future quarters in part because of the difficulty of maintaining high growth rates calculated off progressively larger base revenue numbers 
since large orders are increasingly important to us  our quarterly results are subject to wide fluctuation 
we derive a significant portion of our license revenues from relatively large orders 
we expect the percentage of larger orders as related to total orders to increase 
this dependence on large orders makes our net revenue and operating results more likely to vary from quarter to quarter because the loss of any particular large order is significant 
as a result  our operating results could suffer if any large orders are delayed or cancelled in any future period 
in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  our top five customers accounted for   and respectively  of the total license revenue in those quarters 
we expect that we will continue to depend upon a small number of large orders for a significant portion of our license revenues 
we face significant competition  which could make it difficult to acquire and retain customers and inhibit any future growth 
we expect the competition in the market in which we operate to persist and intensify in the future 
competitive pressures may seriously harm our business and results of operations if they inhibit our future growth  or require us to hold down or reduce prices  or increase our operating costs 
our competitors include  but are not limited to 
potential customers that use in house development efforts  
developers of software that directly addresses the need for web content management  such as documentum  eprise  filenet  intranet solutions  rational software and vignette 
we also face potential competition from our strategic partners or from other companies  such as microsoft  oracle or ibm  that may in the future decide to enter our market 
many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
many of these companies can also leverage extensive customer bases and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
potential competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
barriers to entering the web content management software market are relatively low 
although we believe the number of our competitors is increasing  we believe there may be consolidation in the web content management software industry 
we expect that the general downturn of stock prices in the internet and technology industries since march will result in significant acceleration of this trend  with fewer but more financially sound competitors surviving that are better able to compete with us for our current and potential customers 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic relationships  the market acceptance of our products  and our profitability  may suffer 
to offer products and services to a larger customer base our direct sales force depends on strategic partnerships and marketing alliances to obtain customer leads  referrals and distribution 
if we are unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or fail to enter into additional strategic relationships  our ability to increase our sales and reduce expenses will be harmed 
we would also lose anticipated customer introductions and co marketing benefits 
our success depends in part on the success of our strategic partners and their ability to market our products and services successfully 
we also rely on our strategic partnerships to aid in the development of our products 
should our strategic partners not regard us as significant for their own businesses  they could reduce their commitment to us or terminate their respective relationships with us  pursue other partnerships or relationships  or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products and services 
even if we succeed in establishing these relationships  they may not result in additional customers or revenues 
because the market for our products is new  we do not know whether existing and potential customers will purchase our products in sufficient quantity for us to achieve profitability 
the market for web content management software in which we sell is new and rapidly evolving 
we expect that we will continue to need intensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective clients about the uses and benefits of our products and services 
various factors could inhibit the growth of the market  and market acceptance of our products and services 
in particular  potential customers that have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business over the internet may be reluctant to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will continue to expand 
the recent economic downturn may reduce our sales and may cause us to experience operating losses 
in recent months many signs have pointed to widespread economic slowdowns in the markets we serve 
capital spending in general and capital spending on web initiatives in particular may decline 
this trend could harm our sales if it results in order cancellations or delays  and the longer the trend continues the more harm our sales will suffer 
in addition  since many of our customers may be suffering adverse effects of the general economic slowdown  we may find that collecting accounts receivable from existing or new customers will take longer than we expect or that some accounts receivable will become uncollectable 
acquisitions may harm our business by being more difficult than expected to integrate  by diverting management s attention or by subjecting us to unforeseen accounting problems 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity  we might be unable to negotiate the terms of that acquisition successfully  finance it  develop the intellectual property acquired from it or integrate it into our existing business and operations 
we may also be unable to select  manage or absorb any future acquisitions successfully 
further  the negotiation of potential acquisitions  as well as the integration of an acquired business  especially if it involved our entering a new market  would divert management time and other resources and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
we may have to use a substantial portion of our available cash  including proceeds from public offerings  to consummate an acquisition 
on the other hand  if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any particular acquisition  even if successfully completed  will ultimately benefit our business 
in connection with our acquisitions  we may be required to write off software development costs or other assets  incur severance liabilities  amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  or incur debt  any of which could harm our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the companies we acquire may not have audited financial statements  detailed financial information  or adequate internal controls 
there can be no assurance that an audit subsequent to the completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance  including with respect to revenues  expenses  contingent or other liabilities  and intellectual property 
any such write off could harm our financial results 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it particularly difficult for us to forecast revenue  requires us to incur high costs of sales  and aggravates the variability of quarterly fluctuations 
the time between our initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale  which we refer to as our sales cycle  typically ranges between three and nine months depending largely on the customer 
if we do not shorten our sales cycle  it will be difficult for us to reduce sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  as a result of our lengthy sales cycle  we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing and size of specific sales 
this makes it more difficult to predict quarterly financial performance  or to achieve it  and any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter could harm our business and cause our operating results to vary significantly 
we rely heavily on sales of one product  so if it does not continue to achieve market acceptance we are likely to experience operating losses 
since  we have generated substantially all of our revenues from licenses of  and services related to  our teamsite product 
we believe that revenues generated from teamsite will continue to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
a decline in the price of teamsite  or our inability to increase license sales of teamsite  would harm our business and operating results more seriously than it would if we had several different products and services to sell 
in addition  our future financial performance will depend upon successfully developing and selling enhanced versions of teamsite 
if we fail to deliver product enhancements or new products that customers want it will be more difficult for us to succeed 
we depend on our direct sales force to sell our products  so future growth will be constrained by our ability to hire  train and retain sales personnel 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
our ability to sell more products is limited by our ability to hire  train and retain direct sales personnel  and we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge that we need 
some of our competitors may have greater resources to hire or retain personnel with that skill and knowledge 
if we are not able to hire or retain experienced and competent sales personnel  our business would be harmed 
furthermore  because we depend on our direct sales force  any turnover in our sales force can significantly harm our operating results 
sales force turnover tends to slow sales efforts until replacement personnel can be recruited and trained to become productive 
see we must attract and retain qualified personnel  which is particularly difficult for us because we compete with other internet related software companies and are located in the san francisco bay area  where competition for personnel is extremely intense 
if we do not continue to develop our indirect sales channel  we will be less likely to increase our revenues 
if we do not develop indirect sales channels  we may miss sales opportunities that might be available through these channels 
for example  domestic and international resellers may be able to reach new customers more quickly or more effectively than our direct sales force 
our investment of resources to develop indirect sales channels may not succeed in establishing a channel that can market our products effectively and provide timely and cost effective customer support and services 
in addition  we may not be able to manage conflicts across our sales channels  and our focus on increasing sales through our indirect channel may divert management resources and attention from direct sales 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel  which is particularly difficult for us because we compete with other internet related software companies and are located in the san francisco bay area  where competition for personnel is extremely intense 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
we compete for experienced engineering  sales and consulting personnel with internet professional services firms  software vendors  consulting and professional services companies 
it is also particularly difficult to recruit and retain personnel in the san francisco bay area  where we are located 
although we provide compensation packages that include incentive stock options  cash incentives and other employee benefits  the volatility and current market price of our common stock may make it difficult for us to attract  assimilate and retain highly qualified employees in the future 
in addition  our customers generally purchase consulting and implementation services 
while we have recently established relationships with some third party service providers  we continue to be the primary provider of these services 
it is difficult and expensive to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel to perform these services  and we may from time to time have inadequate levels of staffing to perform these services 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to provide those services  or we could experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction  any of which would harm our business 
if we do not improve our operational systems on a timely basis  we will be more likely to fail to manage our growth properly 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years 
we intend to continue to expand our operational systems for the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage our growth  we need to implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement and improve these systems in a timely manner  our business will be seriously harmed 
difficulties in introducing new products and upgrades in a timely manner will make market acceptance of our products less likely 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and internet related technology enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
we expect to add new content management functionality to our product offerings by internal development  and possibly by acquisition 
content management technology is more complex than most software  and new products or product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing new products could harm our business 
new products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule or may contain defects when released 
either situation could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new software products  or deliver enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
our operating results suffer as a result of stock based compensation charges and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
under us generally accepted accounting principles that apply to us  we have accounted for the four business combinations since our inception using the purchase method of accounting 
under purchase accounting  we recorded the market value of our common shares issued in connection with mergers and acquisitions with the fair value of the stock options assumed  which became options to purchase our common shares and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of acquiring these entities 
that cost is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as goodwill in process research and development  acquired technology  acquired workforce and covenants not to compete  based on their respective fair values 
we have also recorded deferred compensation liabilities related to options assumed and shares issued to effect business combinations as well as options granted below fair market value associated with our initial public offering in october the amortization of intangibles and deferred stock based compensation resulted in expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  for the future amortization expense related to the acquisitions and deferred stock based compensation liabilities may be accelerated as management assesses the value and useful life of the intangible assets 
if we were to reprice outstanding stock options held by our current employees  we may be required to record a compensation charge on a quarterly basis as a result of variable plan accounting treatment  which would lower our earnings 
our products might not be compatible with all major platforms  which could limit our revenues 
our products currently operate on the microsoft windows nt  microsoft windows  linux  ibm aix  hewlett packard ux and sun solaris operating systems 
in addition  our products are required to interoperate with leading web content authoring tools and web application servers 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in these applications and operating systems 
if our products were to be incompatible with a popular new operating system or internet business application  our business would be harmed 
in addition  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by vendors of operating systems  browsers  back office applications  and other internet related applications  could also harm our business 
we have limited experience conducting operations internationally  which may make it more difficult than we expect to continue to expand overseas and may increase the costs of doing so 
to date  we have derived the majority of our revenues from sales to north american customers 
we have recently expanded our international operations 
there are many barriers to competing successfully in the international arena  including 
costs of customizing products for foreign countries  
development of foreign language graphical user interface for development  
restrictions on the use of software encryption technology  
dependence on local vendors  
compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  
longer sales cycles  
revenue recognition criteria  
foreign exchange fluctuations  
import and export restrictions and tariffs  and 
negotiating and executing sales in a foreign language 
as a result of these competitive barriers  we cannot assure you that we will be able to market  sell and deliver our products and services in international markets 
if our services revenue does not grow substantially  our total revenue is unlikely to increase 
our services revenue represent a significant component of our total revenue of total revenue for  of total revenue for and of total revenue for we anticipate that services revenue will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
to a large extent  the level of services revenue depends upon our ability to license products which generate follow on services revenue 
additionally  services revenue growth depends on ongoing renewals of maintenance and service contracts 
moreover  as third party organizations such as systems integrators become proficient in installing or servicing our products  our services revenues could decline 
our ability to increase services revenues will depend in large part on our ability to increase the capacity of our professional services organization  including our ability to recruit  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
we might not be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  a loss of which could harm our business 
we depend upon our proprietary technology  and rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect it 
we currently do not have any issued united states or foreign patents  but we have applied for several us patents 
it is possible that patents will not be issued from our currently pending patent applications or any future patent application we may file 
we have also restricted customer access to our source code and required all employees to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as the laws of the united states  and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international presence 
in addition  third parties may claim that our products infringe theirs 
our failure to deliver defect free software could result in losses and harmful publicity 
our software products are complex and have in the past and may in the future contain defects or failures that may be detected at any point in the product s life 
we have discovered software defects in the past in some of our products after their release 
although past defects have not had a material effect on our results of operations  in the future we may experience delays or lost revenue caused by new defects 
despite our testing  defects and errors may still be found in new or existing products  and may result in delayed or lost revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve acceptance  reduced customer satisfaction  diversion of development resources and damage to our reputation 
as has occurred in the past  new releases of products or product enhancements may require us to provide additional services under our maintenance contracts to ensure proper installation and implementation 
moreover  third parties may develop and spread computer viruses that may damage the functionality of our software products 
any damage to or interruption in the performance of our software could also harm our business 
defects in our products may result in customer claims against us that could cause unanticipated losses 
because customers rely on our products for business critical processes  defects or errors in our products or services might result in tort or warranty claims 
it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions in our contracts will not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
we have not experienced any product liability claims like this to date  but we could in the future 
further  although we maintain errors and omissions insurance  this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover us 
a successful product liability claim could harm our business 
even defending a product liability suit  regardless of its merits  could harm our business because it entails substantial expense and diverts the time and attention of key management personnel 
we have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts  which might tend to suppress our stock price 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control include 
we are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock  which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  
we provide for the election of only one third of our directors at each annual meeting of stockholders  which slows turnover on the board of directors  
we limit who may call special meetings of stockholders  
we prohibit stockholder action by written consent  so all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and 
we require advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
the location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes and power outages 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
additionally  california has experienced power outages in the recent past 
a significant disaster  such as an earthquake or a prolonged power outage  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition by disrupting our employees productivity or damaging our facilities 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency may harm our business 
we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes 
historically  these risks were minimal for us  but as our international revenue and operations have grown and continue to grow  the adverse currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures have related to operating expenses and sales in australia  asia and europe that were not us dollar denominated 
the increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european union could affect our foreign exchange exposure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december   of our total portfolio matures in one year or less 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  fair total value in thousands cash equivalents and short term investments    average interest rates the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  total fair value cash equivalents  short term and long term investments     average interest rates we did not hold derivative financial instruments as of december   and have never held such instruments in the past 
in addition  we had no outstanding debt as of december  equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity investments as such investments are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
interwoven typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure in these equity investments 
as of december   the position in equity investments did not reflect any unrealized gain or loss because the carrying value of the investments approximated their fair value 
foreign currency risk currently the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  as a result we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we do expect to execute transactions in foreign currencies in  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date 
commodity price risk we did not hold commodity instruments as of december   and have never had such instruments in the past
