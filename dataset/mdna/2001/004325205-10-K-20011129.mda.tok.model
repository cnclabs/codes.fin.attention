item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  publishes  distributes and markets under its brand names video and computer games on a worldwide basis for popular interactive entertainment consoles  such as sony s playstation and playstation  nintendo s game boy advance and gamecube and microsoft s xbox  and  to a lesser extent  pcs 
in fiscal  the company released a total of thirty five titles for playstation  playstation  game boy color  dreamcast and pcs 
in fiscal  the company currently plans to release a total of approximately fifty titles for playstation  playstation  game boy advance  gamecube  xbox and pcs 
the company develops its own software in its six software development studios located in the us and the us  which includes a motion capture studio and a recording studio in the us  and contracts with independent software developers to create software for the company 
the company distributes its software directly through its subsidiaries in north america  the uk  germany  france  spain  and australia 
the company uses regional distributors in japan and the pacific rim 
the company also distributes software developed and published by third parties  develops and publishes strategy guides relating to its software and issues special edition comic magazines from time to time to support its time valued brands  turok and shadow man 
the video and computer games industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  which have resulted in successive introductions of increasingly advanced game consoles and pcs 
as a result of the rapid technological shifts  no single game console or pc system has achieved long term dominance in the video and computer games market 
therefore  the company must continually anticipate game console cycles and its research and development group must develop software programming tools necessary for emerging hardware systems 
the company s revenues have traditionally been derived from sales of software for the then popular game consoles 
accordingly  the company s performance has been  and is expected in the future to be  materially and adversely affected by platform transitions 
in fiscal  the video and computer games industry began experiencing another platform transition from bit and bit to bit game consoles and related software 
the company believes that sales of bit and bit game consoles peaked in fiscal  and deteriorated in fiscal and this transition during fiscal resulted in increased competition  fewer hit titles capable of achieving significant sales levels and increased price weakness for non hit titles 
the software transition also resulted in an industry wide software price weakness which impacted the company s operating results during fiscal  as the market commenced a shift to next generation systems that were launched by sega in fiscal and sony in fiscal sony introduced playstation in japan in the spring of and shipped a limited number of units in the us and europe in the fall of sony announced that it expects to sell twenty three million playstation units worldwide by the end of calendar year microsoft introduced its xbox system entering the video game console market for the first time in the us in november  it has announced it plans to ship approximately one million xbox units in the us by the end of calendar nintendo introduced its next generation system  the gamecube  in japan in september and in the us in november  and has announced that it intends to ship approximately two and one half million units in these two territories by the end of calendar nintendo intends to launch the gamecube in europe in the spring of nintendo also launched its new handheld system  game boy advance  in japan  the us and europe in the spring of in early  sega announced its plan to exit the hardware business  cease distribution and sales of its dreamcast console and re deploy its resources to develop software for multiple platforms 
see factors affecting future performance industry trends  platform transitions and technological change may adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability above 
the company s current release schedule is developed around playstation  xbox  game boy advance and gamecube 
the company will continue to support legacy systems  such as playstation  on a limited basis 
the company did not release any n titles in fiscal and does not plan to release any new n or dreamcast titles in fiscal in early  sega announced its plan to exit the hardware business  cease distribution and sales of its dreamcast console and re deploy its resources to develop software for multiple platforms 
although the installed base of next generation systems in fiscal did not support software sales at the levels achieved in fiscal million  which was prior to the current platform transition  when the current transition is complete  the company anticipates that the eventual installed base of bit systems will provide a market for its software large enough to substantiate software sales at levels greater than those achieved in fiscal  and improved gross margins are expected based on the predominance of cd based product rather than cartridge based product when compared to fiscal and there can be no assurance  however  that the next generation game systems eg  nintendo s gamecube  microsoft s xbox and sony s playstation will achieve commercial success similar to and or consistent with the previous level of installed bases of the bit playstation or bit n  nor can there be any assurances made as to the timing of their success 
see liquidity and capital resources below and factors affecting future performance industry trends  console transitions and technological change may adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
the technological advances that have been incorporated into sony s playstation  nintendo s gamecube and microsoft s xbox include  in addition to faster microprocessors and more powerful graphics chipsets  a host of new features not previously offered in video game consoles 
both playstation  and xbox utilizing peripheral equipment  are capable of playing dvd movies 
in addition  playstation  gamecube and xbox each feature dial up and broadband internet connectivity capability 
these new console features provide consumers with a single product that serves multiple entertainment functions 
the rapid technological advances in game consoles have significantly changed the look and feel of software as well as the software development process 
currently  the process of developing software for the new bit consoles is extremely complex and the company expects it to become even more complex and expensive with the advent of more powerful future game consoles 
according to the company s current estimates  the average development time for a title for dedicated game consoles is between twelve and thirty six months and the average development cost for a title is between million and million 
the average development time for the company s software for handheld systems is currently between six and nine months and the average development cost for a title is between  and  the company s revenues in any period are generally driven by the titles released by the company in that period 
the company has experienced delays in the introduction of new titles  which has had a negative impact on its operations  as well as quarterly and annual reported financial results 
it is likely that some of the company s future titles will not be released in accordance with the company s operating plans  in which event its results of operations and profitability in that period would be negatively affected 
see liquidity and capital resources below and factors affecting future performance revenues and liquidity are dependent on timely introduction of new titles 
revenues from the company s bit and bit software in fiscal were significantly below the company s projections and fiscal results  as the company moved to implement its strategy to transition its business operating model to focus on cd based product 
see gross profit below 
although the company anticipated the softening of the market for the maturing game consoles it was not able to precisely gauge the depth of the impact of this industry transition on the company s revenue 
the company attributes the significant revenue decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal to four primary factors lower than expected retail sell through on certain n and dreamcast titles  which accounted for approximately  less units being sold at or near full price  thus requiring the company to provide higher sales allowances  delays in the introduction of six new titles which impacted fiscal gross revenue by approximately million  the industry transition to next generation systems  the company implemented a strategy to cease development of all n software  which accounted for approximately of the company s total gross revenue for fiscal  at a time when the company s release strategy was nintendo n dependent  the company cancelled fourteen titles primarily for n  dreamcast  and pc systems scheduled for release in fiscal with total forecasted gross revenue of approximately million 
in fact  the company s fiscal n business decreased from fiscal and accounted for of the total fiscal gross revenue 
the company assessed the impact that the above factors had on the level of returns and price concessions that would need to be provided on shipments of new bit and bit products during the last half of fiscal  and given its decision to exit the n market  the company established higher allowances for n products shipped during fiscal and increased its allowances for n products that remained unsold in the retail channel 
the decline in fiscal sales was partially offset by revenues from software for sega s dreamcast  but sales for this console were lower in fiscal than the prior year based predominantly on sega s announced hardware product discontinuation 
revenues from sales of the company s software in fiscal increased predominantly as a result of increases in sales of playstation  playstation and game boy products  and reduced markdown allowances due to the change in the overall product mix from cartridge to cd based product  which have a shorter order cycle and require less on hand inventory 
as a result of the industry platform transition  revenues from the company s bit software and certain bit software in fiscal were negatively impacted by the continuous decline of the market for n software and the company s prior emphasis on developing products for the n platform  the decline of the market for dreamcast software and sega s exit from the hardware market  and the limited number of playstation consoles 
as of august   there were approximately million playstation consoles in the united states 
see results of operations discussion below 
in fiscal  the company changed its quarterly closing dates from the last calendar day of the quarter to the saturday closest to the quarter end 
the change applied to quarterly dates while the year end date remained unchanged 
the change did not have a material effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the company for any quarter in fiscal the company recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share and net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
earnings from operations increased due primarily to a significant reduction of million  or  in operating expenses from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the second half of fiscal and continuing into fiscal  the company implemented the following initiatives to reduce fixed and variable expenses company wide by eliminating certain marginal titles under development  reducing staff and lowering marketing and selling expenses o reduction of marketing and selling expenses the company made the strategic decision to limit tv and print media advertising expenditures for software compatible with next generation systems because the installed base in north america of the playstation system was not sufficient million units as of august  to warrant such expenditures 
this action was the primary reason for the reduction in marketing and selling expenses from million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal o reduction of overhead and other operating expenses through a series of targeted headcount and other operating expense reductions  the company successfully executed its cost reduction plan  which for fiscal reduced overhead and other operating expenses by million  or  to million from million for the prior year 
the company reduced personnel by  from employees at may  to employees at august  for fiscal years  and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s gross revenues were derived from software developed by its studios 
revenue for fiscal included two internally developed software titles  crazy taxi and all star baseball  which together accounted for approximately of gross revenues 
the company implemented a three tier product development strategy in fiscal to ensure that its software would be competitive for all of the next generation hardware systems first  it directed its studios to develop the software tools and engines for all the next generation hardware systems  second  it ensured that the development of its key titles for next generation systems were performed by its internal studios ie  turok  jinx  all star baseball  and nfl quarterback club  among others and third  it contracted with independent studios for the development of software for playstation and game boy color 
internal development of games permits the company to better control variable expenses  spread the costs of its software development tools and engines across several different games  shorten the development time and costs of creating sequels ie all star baseball  and nfl quarterback club  protect the proprietary game engine technology for next generation systems  and helps ensure the timeliness and quality of its titles 
research and development expenses declined million or primarily as a result of the reduction of the overall number of titles in development 
because of the focus on fewer  better games for the next generation systems  and the fact that a significant amount of the research and development work for developing the next generation game engines was completed in fiscal and  the company believes that it is well positioned to compete in the future 
the company generally expects research and development expenses to increase ratably with net revenue in the future as it develops titles and sequels across all platforms 
see factors affecting future performance profitability is affected by research and development expense fluctuations due to console transitions and development for multiple consoles 
as the company emerges from the current game console transition and prepares to compete in the software market for next generation systems  it is necessary that the company continue to meet its product release schedule  sales projections and manage its operational expenditures at planned levels in order to generate sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and to repay the remaining note holders at maturity 
see liquidity and capital resources and note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the company s results of operations in the future will be dependent in large part on the timing and rate of growth of the software market for bit and other emerging game systems and the company s ability to identify  develop and timely publish  in accordance with its product release schedule  software that performs well in the marketplace 
results of operations the following table shows certain statements of consolidated operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal years ended august  domestic revenues foreign revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses marketing and selling general and administrative research and development goodwill writedown litigation recovery total operating expenses earnings loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense total other expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit earnings loss before extraordinary gain extraordinary gain net earnings loss net revenues the company s gross revenues were derived from the following product categories fiscal years ended august  nintendo game boy software nintendo software subtotal for cartridge based software sony playstation bit software sony playstation bit software sega dreamcast bit software less than subtotal for cd based software pc software total sales occurred primarily during the first quarter of fiscal note the numbers in the above schedule do not give effect to sales credits and allowances as the company does not track sales credits and allowances by product category 
accordingly  the numbers presented may vary materially from those that would be disclosed were the company able to present such information net of sales credits and allowances as a percentage of net revenues 
the company derives net revenues from shipment of finished products to its customers 
net revenues from product sales are recorded after deducting the estimated cost of allowances for returns and price concessions given 
for the fiscal year ended august   net revenues of million reflected an increase of approximately million or  compared to million for the same period last year 
revenues from sales of the company s software in fiscal increased predominantly as a result of increases in sales of playstation  playstation and game boy products  and reduced markdown allowances due to the change in the overall product mix from cartridge to cd based product  which has a shorter order cycle and require less on hand inventory  which the company believes will permit more accurate and lower allowance estimates 
as a result of the industry platform transition  revenues from the company s bit software and certain bit software in fiscal were negatively impacted by the continuous decline of the market for n software and the company s prior emphasis on developing products for the n platform  the decline of the market for dreamcast software and sega s exit from the hardware market  and the limited number of playstation consoles 
during fiscal  the accelerated hardware transition that had commenced in fiscal reversed course and began to slow due to production delays experienced by sony in the manufacture of its playstation as a result  n  dreamcast and other related and marked down products in the retail channel continued to sell through at higher rates than previously forecasted because of the unavailability of playstation in the marketplace in the quantities expected 
accordingly  in fiscal  the company did not need to provide for any additional sales allowances for n products as a result of better than expected continued sell through of n and other remaining and marked down products in the retail channel 
in the fiscal year ended august   the dave mirra freestyle bmx franchise for multiple platforms  mary kate ashley for multiple platforms crazy taxi  and all star baseball each for playstation  accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of the company s gross revenues 
in the fiscal year ended august   wwf attitude for multiple platforms  the ecw franchise for multiple platforms  the south park franchise for multiple platforms and the turok franchise for multiple platforms  accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of the company s gross revenues 
in the fiscal year ended  turok seeds of evil for multiple platforms  wwf attitude for multiple platforms  wwf warzone for multiple platforms  and south park for multiple platforms accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of the company s gross revenues 
sales of titles using south park properties aggregated less than and of gross revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
licenses relating to south park  and wwf software were either not renewed or were terminated in fiscal based on the company s product release strategy  financial resources and the economic viability of such products 
as a result of ecw s bankruptcy in fiscal  the company can no longer utilize ecw s license 
sales of titles using ecw properties aggregated of gross revenues during that year 
in november  the company released four titles for nintendo s gamecube and two titles for game boy advance 
the company anticipates that its mix of domestic and foreign net revenues will continue to be affected by the content of titles it releases to the extent such titles are more relatively positioned for the domestic consumer 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter are generally derived from software first released in that quarter or in the immediately preceding quarter 
see factors affecting future performance revenues and liquidity are dependent on timely introduction of new titles and the company s future success is dependent on its ability to release hit titles 
gross profit gross profit is significantly affected by the sales mix between cd based and cartridge based software 
gross profit is also from time to time significantly affected by the level of price concessions provided to retailers and distributors as well as from fees paid to third party distributors for software sold overseas 
the company grants price concessions to its key customers who are major retailers that control the market access to the consumer  when those concessions are necessary to maintain the company s relationships with the retailers and access to its retail channel customers 
if the consumers demand for a specific title falls below expectations or significantly declines below previous rates of sale  then  a price concession or credit may be negotiated to spur further sales 
gross profit percentages earned on foreign software sales to third party distributors are generally one third lower than those on sales the company makes directly to foreign retailers 
gross profit of million of net revenues for the fiscal year ended august  increased million or from million of net revenues for the fiscal year ended august  the increased gross profit for fiscal over the prior year is due to significant playstation and playstation software sales volume and the reduced dependency on n products 
the company s improved gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal is partially attributable to the strategic transformation of its operating business model from cartridge based product to cd based product 
for fiscal  n titles accounted for only of gross revenues  compared to approximately of gross revenues in the prior year 
this shift helped the company to achieve lower inventory levels  improved inventory turnover rates  and reduced product manufacturing costs per unit  which had a positive effect on gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
the company realized lower inventory levels because the lead time for the production of software decreased from six to eight weeks for cartridge based software to seven to fourteen days for cd based software 
the company  through an electronic retail sales tracking system provided by a third party  was able to order and deliver products more rapidly based on the reported sell through at retailers  thereby reducing required on hand inventory levels  improving inventory turnover rates and reducing inventory related costs 
additionally  the average cost to manufacture cd based software per unit on average is significantly lower than that of cartridge based software per unit on average  which results in significantly higher gross margins and allows the company to permit markdown allowances to various price points while still recovering the manufacturing cost of the cd based product 
conversely  the higher manufacturing cost of cartridge based software does not permit this flexibility and may prevent the company from recovering its manufacturing cost  as has occurred in the past 
for fiscal  approximately of the company s revenue was derived from cd based product compared to for the prior year 
the improved gross margin for the fiscal year ended august  was also attributable to decreased sales allowances primarily due to increased rates of retail sell through for products released in fiscal  compared to lower sell through rates in the prior year  which resulted in the company providing for and offering customers higher levels of sales allowances in fiscal in fiscal  the company  anticipating the decreased rate of growth for n hardware and decreasing n software sales  established higher allowances for n products that shipped during fiscal  and increased the allowances for n product that remained unsold in the retail channel 
in fiscal  due to the continued sell through of n and other released and marked down products in the retail channel  which resulted from delays in the bit transition  the company did not need to provide for any additional sales allowances for these products and was able to reduce by million previously established allowances related to products that sold through the retail channel where the company did not need to provide the customer a price concession 
the company s gross profit in fiscal is dependent in large part on the timing and rate of growth of the software market for bit and other emerging game consoles  primarily playstation  nintendo s gamecube and microsoft s xbox  and the company s ability to identify  develop and timely publish  in accordance with its product release schedule  software that sells through at projected levels at retail 
see factors affecting future performance liquidity and meeting cash requirements are dependent on achieving timely product releases and sales objectives 
gross profit decreased to million of net revenues for fiscal from million of net revenues for fiscal the decrease of million is predominantly due to the decrease in net revenues  the establishment of increased sales allowances for returns  price concessions and price protection  as well as lower average net selling prices per unit obtained during the platform transition period of fiscal as compared to fiscal operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended august  of million of net revenue were million  or  lower than the million of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended august  operating expenses for the year ended august  of million of net revenue were million  or  higher than the million of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended august  marketing and selling expenses of million of net revenues for the fiscal year ended august  decreased by million or from million of net revenues for the fiscal year ended august  the decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to reduced marketing expenditures in accordance with the company s operating plan to refocus and limit discretionary marketing spending on tv advertising and print media to significantly lower levels than during the prior year 
for fiscal  the company limited funding for tv and media advertising because the estimated installed base in north america of the playstation system of million units as of august  was not deemed sufficient to allow marketing expenditures to be cost effective 
marketing and selling expenses decreased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  from million of net revenues for the year ended august  although marketing expenses increased by million for fiscal over fiscal primarily related to increased television and print advertising  the increase was offset by lower sales commission expenses recognized on lower revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  resulting in the overall decrease in marketing and selling expenses 
the significant increase of marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was due to the lower net revenues achieved in fiscal general and administrative expenses of million of net revenues decreased by approximately million or for the fiscal year ended august  from million of net revenues for the fiscal year ended august  the decrease is primarily due to the cost reduction efforts initiated by the company in the second half of fiscal and continuing throughout fiscal the reductions were realized primarily from reductions in personnel and personnel related expenses 
the company reduced total personnel by of which the majority were general and administrative employees  from employees at may  to employees at august  research and development expenses of million of net revenues decreased by million or for the fiscal year ended august  from million of net revenues for the fiscal year ended august  the decrease in research and development expenses is related to the reduction in the number of overall titles being developed 
in addition  the company reduced development of software for the n and dreamcast console systems and concentrated its software development expenditures predominantly on next generation systems 
because expenditures for developing the software tools and the game engines for next generation consoles are complete  the company now possesses proprietary game engine and technology for next generation consoles which will allow for more cost effective and quicker development of game sequels 
the company generally expects research and development expenses to increase proportionately with anticipated net revenue increases in the future as it develops titles and sequels across all platforms 
research and development expenses increased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  from million of net revenues for the year ended august  the dollar increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to implementing the company s strategy to establish its own brands  increasing the number of internally developed titles  and increasing costs associated with the decision to concurrently develop new game engines and programming tools for the next generation game consoles for sony  nintendo  microsoft and sega while continuing to support the then existing platforms and increased personnel cost at the studios 
software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of the product is established 
prior to establishing technological feasibility  software development costs are expensed to research and development 
subsequent to establishing technological feasibility but before general release of the software  development costs are capitalized 
for sequel products  once a proven game engine technology exists and the company has detailed program designs and other criteria supporting the technological feasibility of the title in development have been met  the company capitalizes the remaining software development costs and begins to expense them upon release of the product or when they are deemed unrecoverable 
once the software is released to the public  ongoing development costs are expensed and capitalized development costs are amortized to cost of revenues 
the company capitalized approximately million of software development costs  net of amortization  for the fiscal year ended august  while it capitalized no software development costs for the fiscal year ended august  interest income and expense interest income decreased by million  or  to million of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august  from million of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august  and decreased by million  or  from million of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august  the reduction in interest income for fiscal and was due to lower average cash balances available for investment 
cash balances were million at august   mainly as a result of the million private placement  million at august  and million at august  interest expense decreased by million  or  to million of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august  from million of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august  and increased from million of net revenue for the fiscal year ended august  in the third quarter of fiscal  the company realized an extraordinary gain of million through the early retirement of million in principal amount of notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  including the use of the proceeds from the concurrent sale of common stock to the note holders 
in addition  in june  the company retired million in principal amount of the notes in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock  which resulted in a non cash extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
the company was subsequently required to issue additional common stock to certain former note holders due to the delayed effective date of an associated registration statement 
the issuance of the additional shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced the related third quarter extraordinary gain of million by approximately million 
as a result  the company reported a net extraordinary gain for the fiscal year ended august  of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concluded that the goodwill associated with acclaim comics  its comics and strategy guides business  was no longer recoverable 
accordingly  the company recorded a million charge to write off the remaining goodwill associated with the business 
this determination was based on the general deterioration in the comic book and strategy guides publishing industry  the shortened longevity of the characters featured in the company s video games and strategy guides and the inability of the featured characters to generate sufficient positive operating cash flows before any charge for goodwill amortization 
the company will continue to publish strategy guides to support its game titles and special issue comic books to support certain of its internally developed characters  ie  turok and shadow man 
income taxes as of august   the company had a us tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million expiring in fiscal years through for the fiscal years ended august   and  the benefit provision for income taxes of million  million and million  respectively  related primarily to federal alternative minimum  state and foreign taxes 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with higher revenues and operating income typically occurring during its first  second and fourth fiscal quarters which corresponds to the holiday selling season 
the timing of the delivery of software titles and the release of new products cause material fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues and earnings  which causes the company s results to vary from the seasonal patterns of the industry as a whole 
see factors affecting future performance revenues vary due to the seasonal nature of video and pc game software purchases 
liquidity and capital resources at august   the company had a negative working capital position of approximately million as compared to million at august  the increase of million in the company s working capital position in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the gross proceeds of million obtained from the private placement 
working capital was negatively impacted at august  as compared to august  due to a reclassification of the notes from a long term to a short term liability 
as of november   the company had cash of approximately million 
see factors affecting future performance liquidity and cash requirements are dependent on achieving timely product releases and sales objectives  if cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet the company s needs  it may be forced to sell assets  refinance debt  or further downsize operations 
the company s working capital and stockholders deficits at august   and the recurring use of cash in operating activities raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
short term liquidity in fiscal was addressed by the company receiving additional borrowings under the credit agreement with the bank  with proceeds from the issuance of common stock and with short term financing from affiliates of the company  which was borrowed and repaid in each of the second and third quarters of fiscal to enhance long term liquidity  the company implemented targeted expense reductions  including a significant reduction in the number of its personnel  and raised million net of expenses from sales of common stock in the private placement  million of other sales of common stock and million from the participation 
in july  the bank in its discretion agreed to loan the company million  above the standard borrowing formula under the credit agreement the overformula loan  which is required to be repaid by january  as security for the overformula loan  the bank was granted a second mortgage on the company s headquarters located in glen cove  new york  and two of the company s executive officers each personally pledged to the bank  shares of the company s common stock  with an approximate aggregate market value of million 
in the event the market value of such pledged stock based on a trading day average reviewed by the bank monthly decreases below million and such executive officers do not deliver additional shares of stock of the company to cover such shortfall  the bank is entitled to reduce the overformula loan by an amount equal to the shortfall 
in october  the company s executive officers pledged an additional  shares of the company s common stock to the bank to cover a shortfall in the aggregate market value of the shares they had already pledged 
such shares were timely delivered to the bank and no reduction to the overformula loan was necessary 
in connection with the overformula loan  the company issued to the bank a five year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share  which was equal to the market price per share on the date of issuance 
in addition  in each of june and april  the bank provided the company with million interim funding  above the standard borrowing formula under the credit agreement 
such interim funding was repaid prior to august  in july  the company successfully completed the private placement of  shares of its common stock to certain investors for gross proceeds of million 
the capital raised from the private placement was utilized for ongoing product development for the next generation systems  the acquisitions of additional strategic properties  integrated marketing and advertising campaigns and the continued reduction of outstanding liabilities 
the common stock issued to the investors is covered by a pending registration statement on file with the sec 
as a result of the delayed effectiveness of the registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock issued in connection with the private placement  the company is required to pay to the investors for each day period following september  a total of  or of the purchase price paid for the stock 
to date  the company has paid an aggregate of million due to the delayed effectiveness 
in march  the bank entered into participation agreements with certain junior participants the junior participants under and pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement between the company and the bank the participation 
following the participation  the bank advanced million to the company pursuant to the credit agreement for working capital purposes 
the credit agreement requires that the company repay the million to the bank upon termination of the credit agreement for any reason  and the junior participation agreements require the bank to repurchase the participation from the junior participants on march  or the date the credit agreement is terminated and the company repays all amounts outstanding thereunder  whichever is earlier 
were the company not able to repay the participation  the junior participants would have subordinate rights assigned to it under the credit agreement with respect to the unpaid participation 
the company owned a building in oyster bay  new york  which it leased to a third party tenant 
in march  under the terms of the lease buyback agreement  the lessee exercised its option to buy back the property for million  which proceeds approximated net book value 
in april and march  the company retired a total of million in principal amount of the notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
concurrently with the note repurchases  the company sold a total of  shares of its common stock to the same note holders for million  based on a purchase price of per share 
the million purchase price of the notes included million for the excess of the fair value of the common stock at issuance over the price paid by the note holders  plus million of cash paid by the company including the use of the proceeds of the stock sale 
as a result of the note retirement  the company recorded an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of the notes in the third quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
because the company was required to issue additional shares of common stock to certain investors due to the delayed effectiveness of its registration statement  the issuance of the additional shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced the related reported third quarter extraordinary gain of by approximately in june  the company retired million in principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest in exchange for  shares of its common stock 
the excess of the million fair value of the shares of common stock issued over the principal amount of the notes retired and accrued interest  amounting to approximately million  was recorded as an extraordinary loss on the early retirement of the notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company reported a net extraordinary gain for fiscal of million 
the company is required to issue to one former note holder in connection with the company s repurchase of that note up to an additional  shares of common stock if the average closing price of its common stock is less than per share for a day period prior to the effective date of the related registration statement 
as of november   the closing price of the company s common stock was 
as a result of the note repurchases the remaining principal amount outstanding was reduced from million at august  to million at august  at august   the company reclassified the notes from a long term liability to a short term liability as the obligation is repayable within one year 
if the company s cash from operations and projected cash flow for the first half of fiscal are insufficient to make interest and principal payments when due  the company may have to restructure its indebtedness 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to restructure or refinance its debt on satisfactory terms  or obtain permission to do so under the terms of its existing indebtedness 
the company cannot assure investors that its future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its debt service requirements or to repay its indebtedness at maturity 
the company s failure to meet these obligations could result in defaults being declared by the bank  and the bank seeking its remedies  including immediate repayment of the debt and or foreclosure on collateral  which could cause the company to become insolvent or cease operations 
in order to meet its debt service obligations  from time to time the company also depends on dividends  advances and transfers of funds from its subsidiaries 
state and foreign law regulate the payment of dividends by these subsidiaries  which is also subject to the terms of the credit agreement and the indenture 
a significant portion of the company s assets  operations  trade payables and indebtedness is located among these foreign subsidiaries 
the creditors of the subsidiaries would generally recover from these assets on the obligations owed to them by the subsidiaries before any recovery by the company s creditors and before any assets are distributed to stockholders
