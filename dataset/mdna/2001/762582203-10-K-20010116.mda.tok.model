item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk management the company imports all of its corn  the primary ingredient in chicken feed  from the united states of america 
fluctuations in the price of corn may significantly affect the company s profit margin 
the company purchased approximately l 
million of corn monthly through the chicago board of trade cbot during fiscal the price of corn and soybean meal  like most grain commodities  is fairly volatile and requires consistent and daily hedging in order to minimize the effect of price increases on the company s profit margin 
the company has been actively hedging its exposure to corn price fluctuations since the company evaluates  on a daily basis  the prices of corn and soybean meal 
all hedging activities are supervised by a hedging committee  which consists of members of the company s management and meets at least once a month to evaluate the company s exposure to corn and soybean meal price fluctuations 
the company s strategy is to hedge against price increases in corn and soybean meal  the company is not involved in speculative trading 
contracts range from one month to six months 
the company will buy directly from the spot market if market conditions are favorable  but as a general rule  the company purchases most of its corn through contracts 
the company s hedging strategy is set in its annual budget  which determines how much corn and soybean meal the company will need and the price the company must pay in order to meet budget forecasts 
the company uses an internal pricing model to prepare sensitivity analysis 
the company bases its target prices on the worst case price assumptions ie high corn prices 
the prices paid by the company for corn were above its budgeted prices for the year ended september  the company has a  credit line with futures usa  inc fimat and draws upon this credit line to cover its initial margin deposit 
the interest rate paid on this line of credit averages an annual rate of less than on drawn amounts 
the company is in frequent contact with its brokers at least three to four times a day and receives advice from the brokers corn experts 
the company s average monthly soybean meal purchase was approximately million for fiscal the hedging strategies for soybean meal purchases are identical to that of corn purchases  except that the company purchases its soybean meal through a company in costa rica  inolasa  in which the company holds a equity ownership 
in costa rica  there is a tax for soybean meal imports  which is not levied if purchased through inolasa 
if for any reason inolasa cannot deliver the soybean meal to the company  the company can buy its soybean meal directly from the cbot 
thus far  the company has never had to purchase soybean meal directly from the cbot 
the prices paid by the company for soybean meal were below budgeted prices for the year ended september  exchange rate risk management the company makes us dollar payments for the majority of its raw materials and bank facilities 
this us dollar expense component is not unique to the company  as most poultry producers in central america must rely on us companies for raw materials such as corn  soybean meal and reproduction birds 
given its us dollar exposure  the company actively manages its currency exchange rate risk 
the company uses a financial model to determine the best strategy to mitigate against the devaluation of the currency of costa rica  the colon  against the us dollar 
the company systematically increases its annual sales prices by a rate that is consistent with the colon devaluation against the us dollar 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  the national devaluation rates were  and  respectively  and correspondingly  the company increased its prices  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s strong market will allow for this type of price increase without sacrificing long term demand and market share 
the company has successfully passed along such price increases for the last five years 
management plans to increase its export operations in order to increase its us dollar revenues  as all export sales are made in us dollars 
for the fiscal year ended september   exports increased  compared to exports for the same period in and represented of total sales 
in addition to fluctuations in the price of corn and soybean meal  the company has exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  as payments for imported corn  soybean meal  reproduction birds and bank facilities are in us dollars 
the company s finance division has the responsibility of monitoring economic and industrial trends that influence foreign exchange levels 
this division examines areas such as poultry gross national product  gross national product gnp  inflation  devaluation  export and import growth rates  growth in real wages  unemployment and population rates in costa rica 
raw material purchases have an average payment period of days  hence exchange rate risk is for four months 
during this time  accounts are paid and costs are updated to reflect new exchange rates 
in the event of a severe devaluation of the colon  or increases in international prices  the company may be able to increase sales prices to recuperate its foreign exchange losses 
in addition  all of the company s exports are denominated in us dollars even exports within central america 
management expects that the strategy to increase exports will increase the company s us dollar revenues 
the company uses a model to determine the maximum devaluation possible before considering whether or not to incur additional us based debt 
in effect  the company borrows in us dollars when economically proven to be less expensive than borrowing in colones
