item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s business and the homebuilding industry in general are subject to changes in economic conditions  including but not limited to employment levels  interest rates  the availability of credit  and consumer confidence 
during the second half of  interest rates rose  and orders fell precipitously compared to the prior year 
this decline was borne out in lower closing volume in crossmann adjusted its overhead spending and closed underperforming markets of louisville  kentucky and nashville  tennessee 
the company also modified its product in some markets to compete more effectively and acquired full ownership of trinity to help offset the closing shortfall 
fortunately  weak order trends reversed themselves 
during the second half of  as mortgage interest rates began to decline and as crossmann s improved pricing and marketing efforts took effect  orders improved 
backlog at december  is higher than at december  without louisville and nashville  margins are expected to be stronger  and trinity should contribute a full twelve months earnings in results of operations during the five year period ended december   the company s sales increased at an average compound annual rate of per year  from million in to million in net income increased at an average compound annual rate of  from million in to million in shareholders equity increased from million as of december  to million as of december  the following table recaps unit growth in the company s markets 
management views volume relative to the total size of each market a significant factor in producing good margins

gross profit decreased by million  or approximately  for the year 
this represents a gross margin percentage of of salesin as compared to in the decrease in margin resulted principally from low margins and exit costs in louisville and nashville 
gross margin was also impacted in by lower margins from trinity closings 
trinty sales had margins of in the fourth quarter of margins produced by crossmann s core markets stayed strong

the company s effective tax rate was in  compared to in year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the years ended december  and  certain income statement items related to the company s operations for the year ended december  percent of sales percent of sales in millions in millions sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations other income  net interest income before income taxes income taxes net income other operating data units closed   average sales per unit closed   units in backlog at december   percentage change  to sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations other income  net interest income before income taxes income taxes net income other operating data units closed average sales per unit closed units in backlog at december sales increased by million  or approximately  in over sales were higher primarily as a result of increased unit sales   units were closed in compared to  in crossmann s average selling price was higher  approximately  in  compared to approximately  in the company attributes the higher selling price to strong employment and relatively low interest rates during much of the year 
these factors caused consumers to add optional items to their homes 
the rise in selling price was also attributable to crossmann s acquisition of homes by huff co 
in june of the new acquisition contributed closings at an average selling price of approximately  which is higher than crossmann s other markets 
gross profit increased by million  or approximately  for the year 
this represents a gross margin percentage of of sales in as compared to in the decrease in margin percentage resulted in part from market mix crossmann achieves generally higher margins in cities where it has operated longer and has greater buying power in the local building market 
stronger closings in newer markets generally yielded lower margins than in more established markets 
the decrease in gross margin percentage can also be attributed to financing assistance paid by crossmann 
as rates trended higher in  the company contributed points and closing costs toward its consumers financing cost  to help keep consumers qualified for mortgage financing 
this practice helps the company retain backlog in periods of rising rates  however  it adds to cost of those sales 
management believes that the lower gross margin in compared to helped crossmann to achieve significantly higher overall volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in higher volume in the newer divisions helped to offset overhead 
due to the increase in sales  income before income taxes for increased approximately million over  or 
this represents a decrease from of sales in to of sales in net income increased million or 
net income as a percentage of sales was in compared to in most of the rate declines were attributable to lower gross margins 
the company s effective tax rate was in  compared to in backlog the following table sets forth certain data relating to the operations of the company for the years ended december   and closings for the period ended    homes in backlog    aggregate sales value in backlog    average sales price of backlog    historically  a substantial portion of the homes in backlog at december are closed prior to june  but because of weather conditions late in and early in  management believes closings will be more skewed than normal to the second half of furthermore  trinity homes in backlog are larger and take longer to complete 
thus  both volume and average selling price should be higher in the second half of  than in the first half 
liquidity and capital resources at december   crossmann had cash and cash equivalents balances of million 
on october   crossmann s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of its outstanding shares  shares out of  shares then outstanding 
as of december    shares had been repurchased and retired pursuant to this plan  at an average price of per share 
during  expenditures were financed with cash from operations and with borrowings on a million unsecured line of credit with bank one  indiana na and its participants 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate  but permits portions of the outstanding balance to be committed for fixed periods of time at a rate equal to libor plus through 
at december  the company had drawn funds on its bank line of credit of  this line of credit has a three year maturity  renewable annually 
the company also has million in senior notes  maturing in with interest payable quarterly at  and annual principal reductions of million  and million in senior notes issued in june of  payable over years at  payable quarterly 
annual principal reductions for this note issue of million begin june  both the note agreements and the bank line of credit require compliance with certain financial and operating covenants and place certain limitations on the company s investments in land and unconsolidated joint ventures 
they also restrict payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock by the company 
the company s primary uses of capital are home construction costs and the purchase and development of land 
real estate inventories were approximately million or of total assets at december  compared to approximately million or of total assets at december  to assure the future availability of developed lots for next year s operations  from time to time in the normal course of business the company contracts to purchase a portion of its developed lots from outside developers 
total commitments for these purchases were approximately million at december  the purchases of these lots are subject to various conditions imposed on both the sellers and the company 
capital is also used to add and improve equipment used in administering the business and for model home furnishings 
in  the company acquired the remaining interest of a joint venture  trinity homes  llc 
this transaction gave rise to approximately million in goodwill in from time to time  crossmann enters into joint ventures with other builders and developers  to share risk and to obtain external expertise 
crossmann s investment in and advances to joint ventures decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in this investment declined in when the remaining equity interest in trinity homes  llc was acquired 
the notes and the banks credit agreement are expected to provide adequate liquidity for planned internal growth and capital expenditures 
in the event that the company seeks to accelerate growth through the acquisition of large parcels of land or of other homebuilders  additional capital may be necessary 
the company believes that such capital could be obtained from banks or other financing alternatives  from the issuance of additional shares  or from seller financing  however  there can be no assurances that the company would be able to secure the necessary capital 
inflation and effects of changing prices the company historically has been able to raise sales prices by amounts at least equal to its cost increases and  accordingly  has not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
however  because the company sells to a price conscious consumer  its ability to raise prices is somewhat limited 
in  the company was able to pass along certain price increases effectively 
the average selling price of crossmann s core product increased from approximately  in to approximately  in generally  management seeks to optimize volume by keeping homes affordable and to optimize margins thorough careful planning 
housing demand  in general  is affected adversely by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  the company s sales of residential real estate could be adversely affected 
in addition  gross profit and net income can be affected because crossmann can assist buyers  subject to certain limitations by fha and va  by paying a portion of a customer s points and closing costs needed to help in securing a mortgage loan 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for the company on january  this statement  as amended by sfas no 
and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a fair value hedge  a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of a foreign currency exposure 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
management has evaluated the requirements of sfas no 
and has determined that the company has no derivative instruments other than normal purchase and sale contracts 
accordingly  management does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results from operations 
future trends management views land acquisition and zoning as the greatest challenges to its business in years to come 
the company will continue to seek to maximize the value of each parcel it purchases so that it can continue to serve its core customer
