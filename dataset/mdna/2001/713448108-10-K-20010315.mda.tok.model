cautionary statements from time to time  in written reports including the chairman s letter in our annual report and in oral statements  we discuss expectations regarding our future performance  the impact of the euro conversion and the impact of current global macro economic issues 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans

introduction to our business items affecting comparability fifty third week in comparisons of to are affected by an additional week of results in the reporting year

bottling transactions in  we announced our intention to restructure our bottling operations in order to compete more effectively  particularly in the north american market 
during  we completed four transactions creating four anchor bottlers 
in april  certain wholly owned bottling businesses  referred to as the pepsi bottling group pbg  completed an initial public offering  with pepsico retaining a direct noncontrolling ownership interest of 
in may  we combined certain other bottling operations with whitman corporation retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 
in july  we combined certain other bottling operations with pepcom industries  inc retaining a noncontrolling interest of 
in october  we formed a business venture with pohlad companies  a pepsi cola franchisee  retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately in the venture s principal operating subsidiary  pepsiamericas  inc our financial statements include the results of our bottling operations on a consolidated basis through the transaction dates above  and our proportionate share of income under the equity method subsequent to those dates 
in december  whitman merged with pepsiamericas 
we now own approximately of the combined bottler which has since changed its name to pepsiamericas  inc as part of the merger  we will participate in an earn out option whereby we may receive additional pepsiamericas shares if certain performance targets are met 
our three anchor bottlers distribute approximately three fourths of our north american volume 
asset impairment and restructuring charges asset impairment charges held and used in the business property  plant and equipment intangible assets other assets held for disposal abandonment property  plant and equipment total asset impairment restructuring charges employee related costs other charges total restructuring total after tax per share impairment by segment frito lay north america pepsi cola international combined segments bottling operations the asset impairment and restructuring charge of million related to the closure of three plants and impairment of equipment at frito lay north america 
the asset impairment charges primarily reflected the reduction in the carrying value of the land and buildings to their estimated fair market value based on current selling prices for comparable real estate  less costs to sell  and the write off of the net book value of equipment which could not be redeployed 
the plant closures were completed during the majority of these assets were either disposed of or abandoned in the restructuring charges of million primarily included severance costs for approximately employees and plant closing costs 
substantially all of the terminations occurred during the asset impairment and restructuring charges of million were comprised of the following a charge of million  for asset impairment of million and restructuring charges of million related to our russian bottling operations 
the restructuring actions  in response to lower demand  an adverse change in the business climate and an expected continuation of operating losses and cash deficits in russia following the august devaluation of the ruble  included a reduction of our cost structure primarily through closing facilities  renegotiating manufacturing contracts and reducing the number of employees 
we also evaluated our long lived bottling assets for impairment  triggered by the reduction in the utilization of assets caused by the adverse economic conditions 
the impairment charge reduced the net book value of the assets to their estimated fair market value  based primarily on amounts recently paid for similar assets in that marketplace 
of the total charge of million  million related to bottling operations that became part of pbg in an impairment charge of million related to manufacturing equipment at frito lay north america 
the charge primarily reflected the write off of the net book value of the equipment and related projects 
disposal or abandonment of these assets was completed in a charge of million for employee related costs resulting from the separation of pepsi cola north america s concentrate and bottling organizations 
of this amount  million related to bottling operations that became part of pbg in the employee related costs for of million primarily included severance and relocation costs for approximately  mostly part time employees 
the terminations either occurred or related to the bottling operations that became part of pbg in restructuring reserves totaling million at december  are included in accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
tropicana acquisition in august  we acquired tropicana products  inc for billion 
the results of operations include tropicana subsequent to the acquisition date 
subsequent acquisition of south beach beverage company  llc on january   we completed the acquisition of south beach beverage company  llc for approximately million in cash  retaining a interest in the newly formed south beach beverage company  inc sobe 
sobe manufactures and markets an innovative line of alternative non carbonated beverages including fruit blends  energy drinks  dairy based drinks  exotic teas and other beverages with herbal ingredients  which are distributed under license by a network of independent distributors  primarily in the united states 
proposed merger with the quaker oats company on december   we announced a merger agreement with the quaker oats company quaker 
under the terms of this agreement  quaker shareholders will receive shares of pepsico capital stock subject to a maximum value of for each quaker share 
in the event that the value exceeds  the exchange ratio is subject to adjustment 
further  if the value of pepsico shares received by quaker shareholders for each quaker share is below  quaker may terminate the merger agreement 
based on the closing price of our stock of per share on december   the proposed tax free transaction would be valued at per quaker share 
the proposed merger is subject to certain closing conditions  including shareholder approval at both companies  and certain regulatory approvals 
assuming that shares of pepsico capital stock are issued for each share of quaker common stock  we will issue approximately million shares of pepsico capital stock to quaker shareholders in the merger 
these pepsico capital shares exchanged for quaker shares will represent approximately of the outstanding shares of pepsico capital stock after the merger 
this information is based on the number of shares of pepsico capital stock and quaker common stock expected to be outstanding at the time of the merger 
in conjunction with the merger agreement  we entered into a stock option agreement with quaker which granted us an option  under certain circumstances  to purchase up to approximately of the outstanding shares of quaker common stock 
the merger is expected to close in the first half of and is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we anticipate that we will sell between to million shares of repurchased pepsico capital stock prior to the closing to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment 
we expect to incur transaction costs of approximately million necessary to complete the merger 
we also expect to incur additional costs subsequent to the merger to integrate the two companies 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  is effective for our fiscal year beginning december  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
based on derivatives outstanding at december   the adoption would increase assets by approximately million and liabilities by approximately million with approximately million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and less than million recognized in the consolidated statement of income 
in may  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  accounting for certain sales incentives 
eitf addresses the recognition and income statement classification of various sales incentives 
among its requirements  the consensus will require the costs related to consumer coupons currently classified as marketing costs to be classified as a reduction of revenue 
the impact of adopting this consensus is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
the consensus is effective for the second quarter of in january  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future 
issue will require that certain cash rebates to customers currently recognized as marketing costs be classified as a reduction of revenue 
the consensus is effective for the first quarter of we are currently assessing this consensus and have not yet made a determination of the impact adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
during  the eitf added to its agenda various other revenue recognition issues that could impact the income statement classification of certain promotional payments 
we classify promotional payments as either a reduction of net sales or marketing costs 
total promotional expenses classified as marketing costs were billion in  billion in and billion in market and other risk factors market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are commodity prices  affecting the cost of our raw materials and fuel  foreign exchange risks  and interest rates on our debt and short term investment portfolios 
in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  including the use of hedging transactions  executed in accordance with our policies 
our hedging transactions include  but are not limited to  the use of various derivative financial and commodity instruments 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
commodity prices we are subject to market risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage this risk primarily through the use of fixed price purchase orders  pricing agreements  geographic diversity and futures contracts 
we use futures contracts to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated commodity purchases  primarily oil  corn  fuel and juice concentrates 
our use of futures contracts is not significant to our commodity purchases 
our commodity futures positions were million at december  and million at december  our commodity futures position resulted in a net unrealized gain of million at december  and a net unrealized loss of million at december  we estimate that a decline in commodity prices would have reduced the unrealized net gain by million and increased the unrealized net loss by million 
any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
foreign exchange international operations constitute about of our and of our business segment operating profit 
operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates  primarily the mexican peso  british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
changes in foreign exchange rates would have the largest impact on translating our international operating profit into us dollars 
on occasion  we may enter into derivative financial instruments  as necessary  to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rate changes 
we manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally 
at december   we had forward contracts to exchange british pounds for us dollars with an aggregate notional amount of million 
unrealized losses on these contracts were million at december  we estimate that an unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have increased the unrealized losses by million 
forward contracts outstanding at december  were not material to the financial statements 
any change in the value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
we use interest rate and currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances  with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the principal  interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt 
accordingly  any market risk or opportunity associated with these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
our investment portfolios primarily consist of cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is our practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end and variable rate debt and investment levels  a one point increase in interest rates would have increased net interest expense by million in and million in the change in this impact from resulted from decreased variable rate debt levels and increased investment levels at year end this sensitivity analysis includes the impact of existing interest rate and currency swaps 
euro conversion on january   member countries of the european union fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
conversion to the euro eliminated currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and financial systems  business processes and equipment  such as vending machines  to accommodate euro denominated transactions and the impact of one common currency on pricing 
since financial systems and processes currently accommodate multiple currencies  the plans contemplate conversion in if not already addressed in conjunction with other system or process initiatives 
we do not expect the system and equipment conversion costs to be material 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects one common currency may have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on financial condition or results of operations
