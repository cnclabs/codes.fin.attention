item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition except for historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  our ability to contain costs  increase recurring revenue  maintain gross revenues at a level necessary to maintain gross profit margins  the availability and acceptance of products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  dependence on key personnel and suppliers  industry wide domestic and international economic conditions and other risks detailed in this section and in the sections entitled results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and cautionary statements and risk factors 
overview we develop  manufacture and market worldwide solid imaging systems designed to rapidly produce physical objects from the digital output of solid or surface data from computer aided design and manufacturing cad cam and related computer systems 
our systems include sla systems and thermojet solid object printers 
sla industrial systems use our proprietary stereolithography sl technology  a solid imaging process which uses a laser beam to expose and solidify successive layers of photosensitive epoxy resin until the desired object is formed to precise specifications in epoxy or acrylic resin 
sl produced parts can be used for concept models  engineering prototypes  patterns and masters for molds  consumable tooling  and short run manufacturing of final product  among other applications 
thermojet solid object printers employ hot melt ink jet technology to build models in successive layers using our proprietary thermoplastic material 
these printers  about the size of an office copier  are network ready and are designed for operation in engineering and design office environments 
the thermojet printer output can be used as patterns and molds  and when combined with other secondary processes such as investment casting  can produce parts with representative end use properties 
our customers include major corporations in a broad range of industries including service bureaus and manufacturers of automotive  aerospace  computer  electronic  consumer and medical products 
our revenues are generated by product and service sales 
product sales are comprised of sales of systems and related equipment  materials  software and other component parts  as well as rentals of systems 
service sales include revenues from a variety of on site maintenance services  customer training  services provided by our technology centers and licensing of d keltool process and support services 
for the year ended december  we continued to show improvements in several areas from the operating plan put in place in the fourth quarter of as a result of increased recurring revenues  particularly materials  and increased unit sales  overall revenue improved considerably from the prior year 
we also continued to realize the benefit from contracts for multi unit sales of sla and thermojet systems 
these sales and marketing efforts  as well as strict cost controls  have resulted in overall increased revenue  significantly improved gross profits  reduced operating expenses and increased profitability 
on september   the company extended its agreement with regent pacific from months to months  with the potential for additional extensions beyond that period 
all other terms of the agreement remain substantially unchanged 
the board of directors took this action based on the results achieved by regent pacific over the last year and the board s confidence in their ability to continue to achieve improved results in the future 
in  we will continue to focus on multi unit sales of our higher end sla systems  selling and marketing efforts related to the rapid manufacturing and niche customization market segments  and continued cost containment efforts 
we expect that our continued emphasis on developing new materials and applications for our products will result in revenues from materials continuing to increase in total as well as a percent of our total revenue  all of which will provide continued opportunities for increased profitability 
these are forward looking statements and  as with other such statements  are subject to uncertainties 
for example  the exact timing of customer requirements  competitive selling and pricing issues  requirements for continued developments of systems and materials  commercial acceptance of new materials  and any ineffectiveness of cost containment efforts may negatively impact our revenue and profitability objectives

sales in were million  an increase of from the million recorded in product sales in of million increased from million in the increase in product sales over the prior year is due primarily to increased sales of sla systems and related equipment of million or and an increase in material revenue of million or 
the increase in machine sales results from increased sales of the higher end sla industrial systems  especially the sla in  we sold a total of sla systems compared to in we expect sales of large frame machines to increase in additionally  we recently have introduced the viper si sla system which we expect to favorably impact our overall system revenue 
this is a forward looking statement and  as with other such statements  is subject to uncertainties 
for example  new products may not be commercially accepted or may suffer technological difficulties 
additionally  the introduction and related pricing of competitive systems may negatively impact the growth rate of recurring revenue 
the increase in material revenue is primarily due to an increase in the installed base of machines and a stronger sales and marketing emphasis on recurring revenue related to the sale of materials derived from post installation sales 
we expect both of these trends to continue in this is a forward looking statement and  as with other such statements  is subject to uncertainties 
for example  the introduction and related pricing of competitive systems and materials may negatively impact the growth rate of recurring revenue 
service sales in totaled million  a decrease of or million from million in the decrease in service revenue is a result of the net impact of a reduction in revenue from maintenance contracts partially offset by an increase related to time and material revenues 
we expect to achieve increases in service revenue in due to the wider variety of maintenance contracts we are offering to our customers and enhanced selling efforts in this area 
this is a forward looking statement and  as with other such statements  is subject to uncertainties 
for example  competitive pricing pressures by third parties supplying maintenance services and the increased reliability of our systems may limit our ability to increase overall service revenues 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to million or of sales in from million or of sales in product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to in compared to in this decrease as a percent of product sales is due primarily to reduced component costs  increased manufacturing activity relative to our level of fixed overhead expenses  and a shift in the sales mix to higher end sla systems in as compared to  all of which positively impacted the overall product cost of sales as a percent of product revenue 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased to in from in this is attributable to a decrease in service revenue over the prior year and a change in the mix of service revenues in from maintenance contracts to time and material revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million or to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of cost reduction benefits associated with the operating plan adopted in late  more focused selling and marketing efforts and high costs associated with the launch of new products in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in decreased million or to million compared to million in this is a result of more focused engineering efforts on specific development projects and the introduction of new products in early research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were in compared to in in the future  we expect research and development expenses as a percent of total revenue to be maintained at approximately of total revenue 
this is a forward looking statement and  as with other such statements  is subject to uncertainties 
for example  if our overall revenue level increases more rapidly than our expenditures on research and development  these costs as a percent of our total revenue may fall below our expected levels 
other expenses 
other expenses totaled million in no such costs were incurred in the cost incurred in related to litigation  settlement costs and non recurring charges associated with certain employee and exit plan costs 
income loss from operations 
operating income in was million or of total revenue versus an operating loss of million or of total revenue in the improvement is primarily attributable to increased revenue  improved gross margins and reduced operating expenses 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
for  our tax provision was million or of the pre tax income  compared to a tax benefit of million on pre tax loss of million in compared to sales 
sales in were million  a decrease of from the million recorded in system sales in increased million or to million compared to million in the increase in sales relates primarily to a higher level of thermojet printers sold 
the sales of sla machines showed a nominal increase in due to problems associated with the introduction of the sla system early in the year which initially created some confusion in the marketplace relative to customers needs and whether the sla system or other systems would better suit our customers requirements 
these issues were addressed in the latter half of the year and resulted in a higher number of sla units being sold relative to the first half of the year 
in  our total revenue from europe increased to million from million in this represents and of our total revenue for and  respectively 
we attribute this higher rate of growth relative to the rest of the world to a less mature market for our systems in europe versus the united states and the benefit realized from the acquisition of a major competitor in material sales in increased million to million versus in this was due primarily to higher material sales for both the sla systems and thermojet printers 
service sales in decreased million  or  compared to  primarily due to increased competition from other providers of service contracts and time and material arrangements  and due to the introduction of tiered pricing plans offered to our customers 
technology center revenues remained at lower levels throughout the year relative to due to a strategic shift in focus to sales support 
also  the sale of the st 
paul  minnesota d keltool inserts business caused a decline in insert revenues in versus cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of sales in compared to million or of sales in product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased from in to in this increase was the result of a change in sales mix resulting from selling a higher number of thermojet printers which have a lower gross margin than sla systems 
this was mitigated slightly by a higher overall level of sales in europe which has historically had a higher average selling price for sla systems than elsewhere and a higher level of material sales  some of which have a relatively high gross margin relative to other products 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased slightly to in from in primarily due to continued competitive pricing pressure relating to longer term maintenance contracts and time and materials services 
in addition  field service revenue decreased as a result of increased reliability of our systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million or to million in versus million in this was primarily due to an increase of million in marketing expenses in over resulting from the marketing and communication programs undertaken for the introduction of the sla system and the thermojet printer in early this was in addition to an overall buildup of the sales and marketing department that occurred during late and continued into early general and administrative expenses increased million to million in versus million in higher costs were incurred relating to general and administrative expenses as a result of management changes during and the lack of strict policies and procedures governing expenditures  which subsequently were established in connection with the new operating plan implemented during the fourth quarter of  as well as costs associated with the sale of the d keltool insert operations and legal expenses associated with the protection of certain of our patents 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased in to million from million in the decrease in research and development expenses in was primarily a result of significant investment in in new product introduction sla system and thermojet solid object printer 
other expenses 
during  we incurred million relating to non recurring charges associated with actions taken by management involving certain employee related costs and costs associated with the litigation and settlement costs for the centuri litigation 
income loss from operations 
the operating loss in was million or of revenue versus operating income of million or of revenue in the loss relates to lower average gross margins  additional operating expenses associated with realigning our operations  and higher marketing costs incurred relative to provision for benefit from income taxes 
for  our tax benefit was million or of the pre tax loss  compared to a tax expense of million on pre tax income of million in our effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by research credits and the effects of foreign operations 
foreign operations international sales  primarily from europe  accounted for  and of total sales in  and  respectively 
for information with respect to allocation of sales among the company s foreign operations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on page f liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december in thousands cash and cash equivalents    short term investments  working capital    cash provided by operating activities    cash used for investing activities    cash provided by used for financing activities  net cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the cash flow from operations in was comprised primarily of net income of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  tax benefit related to stock option exercises of million  increases in accounts payable of million and deferred revenues of million 
this is partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  lease receivables of million  inventory of million  prepaid and other assets of million and a decrease in deferred income taxes of million other liabilities of million 
net cash used for investing activities in totaled million primarily for property and equipment relating particularly to demonstration equipment for new products  computers and manufacturing equipment required for expansion  license and patents costs  and software development costs 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaling million was the result of cash provided from the exercise of stock options net of long term debt repayments 
we believe that funds generated from operations and existing working capital will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next months 
from time to time  we consider the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our current business 
in february  we acquired the stock and intellectual property of optoform sarl see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on page f 
should we decide to pursue such additional transactions  we may need to borrow additional funds 
there were no significant inflationary trends that affected us in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and long term debt 
we invest our excess cash in money market funds or other high quality investments 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to this factor  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on the industrial development bond for our colorado facility  which has a variable interest rate 
the bond has an outstanding balance of million at december   and changes in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the company s operations 
we have not entered into any hedging instruments to protect ourselves against future increases in interest rates  which would negatively impact the amount of interest we are required to pay 
however  we do not feel that this risk is significant and we do not plan to attempt to hedge to mitigate this risk in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for of our total revenue in international sales are made primarily from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are denominated in united states dollars or the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in united states dollars 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the realized effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in resulted in a  gain 
as of december   we had investments in foreign operations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed in foreign currency when subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency produces an immaterial change in our balance sheet as of december
