item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
when used in this discussion  the words expects  anticipates  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements  which include statements as to the company s expected net losses  expected expenditure levels  expected uses of cash  expected cash flows  expected expenditures including expenditures on intellectual property and research and development  and expected investments  the adequacy of capital resources  the effect of the adoption of sfas  and growth in operations  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those risks discussed below  as well as the extent of utilization of genomic information by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  actual and future consolidations of pharmaceutical companies  risks relating to the development of new products and their use by potential collaborators of the company  the impact of technological advances and competition  the ability of the company to obtain and retain customers  competition from other entities  early termination of a database collaboration agreement or failure to renew an agreement upon expiration  the cost of accessing or acquiring technologies developed by other companies  uncertainty as to the scope of coverage  enforceability or commercial protection from patents that issue on gene sequences and other genetic information  developments in and expenses relating to litigation  the results and businesses in which the company has purchased equity  and the matters discussed in factors that may affect results 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
overview incyte genomics  inc incyte or the company designs  develops and markets genomic information based products and services 
these products and services include database products  microarray based gene expression services and snp discovery services  genomic reagents  and related services 
the company s genomic databases integrate bioinformatics software with proprietary and  when appropriate  publicly available genetic information to create information based products and services used by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic researchers to understand disease and to discover and develop drugs 
in july  the company s board of directors approved a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
incyte stockholders of record on august  received one additional share for each share of common stock held at the time 
the additional shares were distributed to eligible stockholders on august  all share and per share data have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the split 
revenues recognized by the company consist primarily of non exclusive database access fees related to database agreements  the sales of genomic screening products and services  fees for contract sequencing services  fees for research programs  and fees for microarray based gene expression services 
the company s database agreements provide for future milestone payments and royalties from the sale of products derived from proprietary information obtained through the databases 
there can be no assurance that any database subscriber will ever generate products from information contained within the databases and  thus  that the company will ever receive additional milestone payments or royalties 
the company s ability to maintain and increase revenues depends on its ability to obtain additional database subscribers  to retain existing subscribers  to expand its product and service offerings and to expand its customer base 
the loss of revenues from any individual database agreement  if terminated or not renewed  could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  although it is not anticipated to have a material adverse impact on the company s business or financial condition 
in  the company intends to make significant investments focused on the further development of its intellectual property portfolio and its internal disease pathway and therapeutic drug discovery programs 
depending on the investment required and the timing of such investments  expenses or losses related to these investments could adversely affect operating results 
in addition to its investments in these areas  the company is continuing to invest in its identification and characterization of full length genes  snp discovery  proteomics and protein annotation  and bioinformatics in as a result  the company expects to report a net loss at least through if the costs of these new and existing programs are greater than anticipated  or if these programs take longer to complete  or if losses are incurred from strategic investments  the company may incur losses in future periods as well 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of proteome  inc  a privately held proteomics database company 
the company issued  shares of its common stock and million in cash in exchange for all of proteome s outstanding capital stock 
in addition  the company assumed proteome s stock options  which if fully vested and exercised  would amount to  shares of its common stock 
the fair value of the stock options assumed were allocated between additional purchase price and deferred compensation in accordance with guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
the amount of the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired of approximately million  was allocated to goodwill million  database million  developed technology million  tradename million  and assembled workforce million  which are being amortized over    and years  respectively 
the company evaluates its intangible assets for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company has made and intends to continue to make strategic equity investments in  and acquisitions of  technologies and businesses that are complementary to the businesses of the company 
as a result  the company may record losses or expenses related to the company s proportionate ownership interest in such long term equity investments  record charges for the acquisition of in process technologies  or record charges for the recognition of the impairment in the value of the securities underlying such investments 
the company has incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses in its defense of the lawsuits filed in january and september by affymetrix  inc affymetrix alleging patent infringement by the company and in the lawsuits filed by the company against affymetrix in august in august  the company filed a patent infringement suit against affymetrix in the united states court for the northern district of california 
the suit alleges infringement of the us patent numbers  and  these patents cover key technologies used in the creation of gene expression data 
in its lawsuits against the company  affymetrix seeks a permanent injunction enjoining the company from further infringement of certain affymetrix patents 
in addition  affymetrix seeks damages  costs  attorneys fees and interest 
affymetrix further requests that any such damages be tripled on its allegation of willful infringement by the company 
with respect to the lawsuits filed by the company  affymetrix has filed counterclaims against the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend these suits and counterclaims vigorously 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in the defense of these suits 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of any loss related to these suits and counterclaims due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome 
regardless of the outcome  this litigation has resulted and is expected to continue to result in substantial expenses and diversion of the efforts of management and technical personnel 
any future litigation could result in similar expenses and diversion of efforts 
further  there can be no assurance that any license that may be required as a result of these suits and counterclaims or the outcome thereof would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
results of operations the company recorded net losses for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively  and net income for the year ended december  of million 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
basic and diluted net income per share was for the year ended december  loss before extraordinary items for was million  or per diluted share 
the net loss per share in reflects the dilutive effect of approximately million shares issued in a february private equity offering 
the net income per share for reflects the issuance of approximately million shares in january in connection with the company s business combination with synteni 
revenues 
revenues for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
revenues resulted primarily from database access fees and  microarray based gene expression services  genomic screening products and services  fees for contract sequencing  and fees from partnering programs 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to database agreements with new customers  revenues from the pfizer partner program  revenues from new products such as the in silico single nucleotide polymorphism issnp product  as well as increased revenues from custom genomics products and services 
expenses 
total costs and expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
total costs and expenses for the year ended december  included a one time charge of million for the purchase of in process research and development relating to the acquisition of hexagen  and acquisition related expenses of million related to the combination with synteni 
total costs and expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future due to our continuing investment in new products and services and additional costs associated with proteome operations 
research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase from over resulted primarily from an increase in bioinformatics and software development efforts  snp discovery efforts  microarray production  partner program expenses  expression database development  an increase in internal disease pathway and therapeutic drug discovery programs  and the development of internet and e commerce products 
the increase from over resulted primarily from the company s genomic sequencing  genetic mapping  and snp discovery initiatives that were started in the second half of  the company s collaborations in the proteomics field  the increase in microarray production  and the costs related to intellectual property protection 
the company expects research and development spending to increase as the company continues to pursue the development of new database products and services  including proteome s proteomic database  and as the company expands its internal disease pathway and therapeutic drug discovery programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over resulted primarily from the growth in the company s sales and marketing function  including its branding efforts  and increased personnel to support the growing complexity of the company s operations 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over resulted primarily from the growth in sales and marketing activities and the increased personnel to support the growing complexity of the company s operations 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses were also impacted by legal expenses related to the company s patent infringement lawsuits with affymetrix and genelogic of approximately million  million and million  in   and  respectively 
the company expects that total selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase  primarily due to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets generated from the proteome acquisition and expenses to support the growing complexity of the company s operations 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  for the years ended december    and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher interest income  and a gain of million from the sale of one of the company s long term strategic investments 
the higher interest income was primarily due to the convertible debt offering and private equity offering in february resulting in higher cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
the decrease in from was primarily due to decreased interest income as a result of lower cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to the interest from the convertible subordinated notes issued by the company in february interest expense remained relatively consistent in as compared to losses from joint venture 
losses from joint venture were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in september  the company formed a joint venture  diadexus  llc diadexus with smithkline beecham corporation 
the loss represents the company s share of diadexus losses from operations 
on april   diadexus converted from an llc to a corporation and completed a private equity financing at which time the company no longer had significant influence over diadexus 
accordingly  the company began accounting for its investment in diadexus under the cost method of accounting as of the date of the financing  and therefore did not reflect diadexus results of operations in the company s statement of operations subsequent to that date 
the loss in was net of million of amortization of the excess of the company s share of diadexus net assets over its basis 
income taxes 
due to the company s net loss in  the company had a minimal effective annual income tax rate 
in  the company had an effective income tax benefit rate of  primarily due to the carryback of the current year net operating loss 
the effective tax rate for was  excluding the charge for the purchase of in process research and development  which represents the provision of federal and state alternative minimum taxes after utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
extraordinary item  net 
in november  the company repurchased million face value of its convertible subordinated notes on the open market 
the repurchases resulted in a gain of million  net of taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas nos 
and  which is required to be adopted in the first quarter of sfas established standards for accounting and reporting derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these instruments at fair value 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
among other things  sab discusses the sec staff s view on accounting for non refundable up front fees 
adoption of sab had no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin  which contains rules designed to clarify the application of apb the company adopted fin on july  and the adoption had no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million as of december  the company has classified all of its marketable securities as short term  as the company may choose not to hold its marketable securities until maturity in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
available cash is invested in accordance with the company s investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  the change in net cash used in as compared to was primarily due to the increases in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities and the slower increase of accounts receivables in as compared to these were partially offset by the increase in prepaid assets and the decrease in deferred revenues 
the change in cash flows from operations in compared to was primarily due to the company s investments in genomic sequencing  mapping  bioinformatics and snp discovery resulting in a net loss in as compared to net income in  and the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  partially offset by increases in accrued and other current liabilities 
the company s investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and net purchases of long term investments 
capital expenditures for the years ended december    and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures increased in and primarily due to investments in computer equipment and software  laboratory equipment  and leasehold improvements related to the expansion of the company s facilities 
long term investments in companies with which the company has research and development agreements were million million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the company sold stock in an investment  resulting in proceeds of million and a gain of million and diadexus repaid its million note to incyte 
in the company liquidated its investment in two such companies  resulting in proceeds of million and a net realized gain of million 
in  the company paid million  net of cash received  in connection with the acquisition of proteome  and in paid million  net of cash received  in connection with the purchase of hexagen 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  capital expenditures and maturity sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the company raising additional funds in two financing transactions 
in february  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in a private placement  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
also in february  the company issued  shares of its common stock in a private placement  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
net proceeds from the sale of those shares were million 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was due to the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the company expects to use net cash in as it invests in its internal disease pathway and therapeutic drug discovery programs  intellectual property portfolio  sequencing  bioinformatics  and snp discovery programs  invests in data processing related computer hardware to support its existing and new database products and to enable the on line delivery of those products  continues to seek access to technologies through investments  research and development alliances  license agreements and or acquisitions  makes strategic investments  and continues to make improvements in existing facilities 
based upon its current plans  the company believes that its existing resources will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company s cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including the ability of the company to attract and retain collaborators for its databases and other products and services  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  expenditures in connection with its recent expansion of internal disease pathway and therapeutic drug discovery programs  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  including capital equipment necessary to ensure the company s sequencing and microarray operations remain competitive  capital expenditures required to expand the company s facilities  and costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions 
changes in the company s research and development plans or other changes affecting the company s operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of the company s capital resources 
euro conversion a single currency called the euro was introduced in europe on january  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
fixed conversion rates between these participating countries existing currencies the legacy currencies and the euro were established as of that date 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until at least january   but not later than july  during this transition period  parties may settle transactions using either the euro or a participating country s legal currency 
this conversion to the euro had no material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the euro on its computer and financial systems  business processes  market risk  and price competition 
factors that may affect results we have had only limited periods of profitability  we expect to incur losses in the future and we may not return to profitability we had net losses from inception in through and again incurred net losses in and because of those losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we intend to continue to spend significant amounts on new product and technology development  including therapeutic drug discovery and development programs and making our products available online  and to increase our investment in marketing  sales and customer service 
the amounts we intend to spend on new product and technology development include spending for our efforts to determine the sequence of genes  or genomic sequencing  determine gene functions  develop database and software products such as our gene expression database  discover snps  expand research and development alliances  and develop electronic commerce products 
as a result  we expect to incur losses in we may report net losses in future periods as well 
we will not return to profitability unless we increase our revenues or reduce our expenses 
to generate significant revenues  we must obtain additional database collaborators and retain existing collaborators as of december   we had over database agreements 
if we are unable to enter into additional agreements  or if our current database collaborators choose not to renew their agreements upon expiration  we may not generate additional revenues or maintain our current revenues 
our database revenues are also affected by the extent to which existing collaborators expand their agreements with us to include our new database products and the extent to which existing collaborators reduce the number of products or services for which they subscribe  the impact of which will vary based upon our pricing of those products and services 
some of our database agreements require us to meet performance obligations  some or all of which we may not be successful in attaining 
a database collaborator can terminate its agreement before the end of its scheduled term if we breach the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a specified period 
our longer term strategy for profitability includes licenses under our gene related intellectual property  but these licenses may not contribute to revenues for several years  and may never result in revenues part of our strategy is to license to database collaborators and to some of our other customers our know how and patent rights associated with the genetic information in our proprietary databases  for use in the discovery and development of potential pharmaceutical  diagnostic or other products 
any potential product that is the subject of such a license will require several years of further development  clinical testing and regulatory approval before commercialization 
therefore  milestone or royalty payments from these collaborations may not contribute to revenues for several years  if at all 
we may not be able to generate significant growth in revenue if we are not able to generate significant revenues from our custom genomic products and services we expect that our custom genomic products and services will become a greater percentage of our revenues 
whether this occurs  and whether these products and services will generate significant revenues  depends on our ability to increase our customer base  increase sales to existing customers  and increase our production capacity in a timely manner and with consistent volumes and quality to meet the increased demand 
our operating results are unpredictable  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 
changes in the demand for our products and services  including our database business  
the introduction of competitive databases or services  including databases of publicly available  or public domain  genetic information  
the nature  pricing and timing of products and services provided to our collaborators  
acquisition  licensing and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  including operating losses of acquired businesses  
losses and expenses related to our investments in joint ventures and businesses  
regulatory developments or changes in public perceptions relating to the use of genetic information and the diagnosis and treatment of disease based on genetic information  
changes in intellectual property laws that affect our rights in genetic information that we sell  
payments of milestones  license fees or research payments under the terms of our increasing number of external alliances  and 
expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights  including the lawsuits filed by affymetrix and counterclaims filed by affymetrix 
we have significant fixed expenses  due in part to our need to continue to invest in product development and extensive support for our database collaborators 
we may be unable to adjust our expenditures if revenues in a particular period fail to meet our expectations  which would harm our operating results for that period 
forecasting operating and integration expenses for acquired businesses may be particularly difficult  especially where the acquired business focuses on technologies that do not have an established market 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price will likely fall  possibly by a significant amount 
our industry is intensely competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  our revenues may decline we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  rapidly changing  and fragmented 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  human and other resources than we do 
if we cannot respond quickly to changing customer requirements  secure intellectual property positions  or adapt quickly and obtain access to new and emerging technologies  our revenues may decline 
our competitors include 
affymetrix  inc  
celera genomics group of applera corporation  
curagen corporation  
gene logic inc  
human genome sciences  inc  
major pharmaceutical companies  and 
universities and other research institutions  including the snp consortium  which is funded by a number of pharmaceutical companies  and those receiving funding from the federally funded human genome project 
the human genome contains a finite number of genes 
our competitors may seek to identify  sequence and determine the biological function of numerous genes in order to obtain a proprietary position with respect to new genes 
in addition  we face competition from companies who are developing and may seek to develop new technologies for discovering the functions of genes  gene expression information  including microarray technologies  discovery of variations among genes and related technologies 
also  if we are unable to obtain the technology we currently use or new advanced technology on acceptable terms  but other companies are  we will be unable to compete 
we also face competition from providers of software 
a number of companies have announced their intent to develop and market software to assist pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers in managing and analyzing their own genomic data and publicly available data 
if pharmaceutical companies and researchers are able to manage their own genomic data  they may not subscribe to our databases 
extensive research efforts resulting in rapid technological progress characterize the genomics industry 
to remain competitive  we must continue to expand our databases  improve our software  and invest in new technologies 
new developments will probably continue  and discoveries by others may render our services and potential products noncompetitive 
our new investments in validating drug targets will lead to increased expenses and may not result in commercial products or services we have recently decided to invest in validating drug targets associated with diseases that may be linked to several or many genes working in combination 
the process of discovering drugs based upon genomics is new and evolving rapidly  and we have limited experience in discovering or developing drugs 
these efforts will result in increased expenses and may not result in commercial products or services 
there is limited scientific understanding generally relating to the role of genes in diseases  and few  if any  products based on gene discoveries have been developed and commercialized 
accordingly  even if we are successful in identifying genes  biological pathways or drug candidates associated with specific diseases  we or our collaborators may not be able to develop or commercialize products to improve human health 
rapid technological development by us or others may result in compounds  products or processes becoming obsolete before we recover our development expenses 
our revenues could decline due to patent positions becoming publicly available  or due to our competitors publicly disclosing their discoveries our competitors may discover and establish patent positions with respect to the genes in our databases 
our competitors and other entities who engage in discovering the location of genes within a dna strand and may make the results of their sequencing efforts publicly available 
currently  academic institutions and other laboratories participating in the human genome project make their gene sequence information available through a number of publicly available databases  including the genbank database 
also  celera genomics group has publicly stated that it is committed to make available to the public basic human sequence data 
the public availability of these discoveries or resulting patent positions covering substantial portions of the human genome could reduce the potential value of our databases to our collaborators 
it could also impair our ability to realize royalties or other revenue from any commercialized products based on this genetic information 
we are involved in patent litigation  which if not resolved favorably could require us to pay damages and stop selling and using microarray products we are currently involved in patent litigation 
if we lose this litigation we could be prevented from producing and using our microarray products  including uses of those products for purposes of providing gene expression database products and gene expression services 
we could also be required to pay damages 
in january  affymetrix filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that we infringe of us patent number  by both the company 
the complaint alleges that we infringed the patent by making  using  selling  importing  distributing or offering to sell in the united states high density arrays and that this infringement was willful 
affymetrix seeks a permanent injunction enjoining us from further infringement of the patent and  in addition  seeks damages  costs  attorneys fees and interest 
affymetrix also requests triple damages based on its allegation of willful infringement by us 
in september  affymetrix filed an additional lawsuit in federal court  alleging we infringed us patent number  and us patent number  the complaint alleges that we infringed the patent by making  using  selling  importing  distributing or offering to sell in the united states high density arrays 
it also alleges that we infringed the patent by using their gem tm microarray technology to conduct gene expression monitoring and other applications using two color labeling  and that this infringement was willful 
affymetrix seeks a permanent injunction enjoining us from further infringement of the and patents 
the court held a pretrial hearing in november to determine how to construe the patent claims that will be litigated in trial 
in january  the court issued a ruling describing how the claims in the  and patents should be interpreted 
in april  the board of patent appeals and interferences of the united states patent and trademark office declared interferences between pending patent applications licensed exclusively to us and the affymetrix and patents 
the board of patent appeals and interferences invokes an interference proceeding when more than one patent applicant claims the same invention 
during the proceeding  the board of patent appeals and interferences evaluates all relevant facts  including those bearing on first to invent  validity  enablement and scope of claims  and then makes a determination as to who  if anyone  is entitled to the patent on the disputed invention 
in september  the board of patent appeals and interferences determined that we had not met our prima facie case  and ruled that the patents licensed by us from stanford university were not entitled to priority over corresponding claims in the two affymetrix patents 
we are seeking de novo review of the board s decisions in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
in august  we filed a lawsuit against affymetrix in federal court alleging infringement of us patent numbers  and  the patents relate to technologies used in the amplification of rna and the generation of gene expression information 
affymetrix has filed counterclaims in this lawsuit that allege  among other things  that we infringe us patent number  and us patent number  these counterclaims allege that we infringe these patents by making  using  offering to sell and or selling within the united states the inventions claimed in the patents  including  in the case of the patent  methods for forming microarrays and  in the case of the patent  methods for analyzing nucleic acids 
the counterclaims also allege that we engaged in acts of unfair competition under california statutory and common law 
affymetrix seeks a permanent injunction enjoining us from further infringement of the patent and patent and  in addition  seeks damages  costs and attorneys fees and interest 
affymetrix further requests triple damages from the infringement claims based on its allegation of willful infringement by us 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the suits and counterclaims brought by affymetrix vigorously 
however  our defenses may be unsuccessful 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of any loss resulting from these suits and counterclaims due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome 
regardless of the outcome  the affymetrix litigation has resulted and is expected to continue to result in substantial expenses and diversion of the efforts of our management and technical personnel 
further  there can be no assurance that any license that may be required as a result of this litigation or the outcome thereof would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
this litigation may also affect our potential customers willingness to use our microarray services and gene expression databases  which could affect our revenue 
if we are subject to additional litigation and infringement claims  they could be costly and disrupt our business the technology that we use to develop our products  and the technology that we incorporate in our products  may be subject to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
the risk of this occurring will tend to increase as the genomics  biotechnology and software industries expand  more patents are issued and other companies attempt to discover genes and snps and engage in other genomic related businesses 
as is typical in the genomics  biotechnology and software industries  we have received  and we will probably receive in the future  notices from third parties alleging patent infringement 
we believe that we are not infringing the patent rights of any third parties 
except for affymetrix  no third party has filed a patent lawsuit against us 
we may  however  be involved in future lawsuits alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to 
assert claims of infringement  
enforce our patents  
protect our trade secrets or know how  or 
determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can be very costly and can divert management s efforts 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses to other parties patents or proprietary rights 
we may also be restricted or prevented from manufacturing or selling our products and services 
further  we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary information  which may result in its unauthorized use and a loss of revenue our business and competitive position depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary database information and software technology 
despite our efforts to protect this information and technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
although our database subscription agreements require our subscribers to control access to our databases  policing unauthorized use of our databases and software may be difficult 
we pursue a policy of having our employees  consultants and advisors execute proprietary information and invention agreements when they begin working for us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may 
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  
otherwise gain access to our proprietary information  or 
design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property 
if the inventions described in our patent applications on full length or partial genes are found to be unpatentable  our issued patents are not enforced or our patent applications conflict with patent applications filed by others  our revenues may decline one of our strategies is to file patent applications on what we believe to be novel full length and partial genes and snps obtained through our efforts to discover the order  or sequence  of the molecules  or bases  of genes 
we have filed us patent applications in which we claimed partial sequences of some genes 
we have also applied for patents in the us and other countries claiming full length gene sequences associated with cells and tissues involved in our gene sequencing program 
we hold a number of issued us patents on full length genes and one issued us patent claiming multiple partial gene sequences 
while the united states patent and trademark office has issued patents covering full length genes  partial gene sequences and snps  the patent and trademark office may choose to interpret new guidelines for the issuance of patents in a more restrictive manner in the future  which could impact the issuance of our pending patent applications 
we also do not know whether or how courts may enforce our issued patents  if that becomes necessary 
if a court finds these types of inventions to be unpatentable  or interprets them narrowly  the value of our patent portfolio and possibly our revenues could be diminished 
we believe that some of our patent applications claim genes and partial sequences of genes that may also be claimed in patent applications filed by others 
in some or all of these applications  a determination of priority of inventorship may need to be decided in an interference before the united states patent and trademark office  before a patent is issued 
if a full length or partial length sequence for which we seek a patent is issued to one of our competitors  we may be unable to include that full length or partial length sequence on a microarray or in a library of bioreagents 
this could result in a loss of revenues 
if the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the us patent laws or if we need to refile some of our patent applications  the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be decreased the value of our patents depends in part on their duration 
a shorter period of patent protection could lessen the value of our rights under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from our patents 
the us patent laws were amended in to change the term of patent protection from years from patent issuance to years from the earliest effective filing date of the application 
because the average time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications is at least one year and may be more than three years depending on the subject matter  a year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection 
also  we may need to refile some of our applications claiming large numbers of gene sequences and  in these situations  the patent term will be measured from the date of the earliest priority application 
this would shorten our period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might obtain from the patents 
international patent protection is particularly uncertain  and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries  we may have to expend substantial sums and management resources biotechnology patent law outside the united states is even more uncertain than in the united states and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
further  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors foreign patents  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
if our programs relating to the role of genetic variation in disease and drug response are not successful  they may not generate significant revenues or result in profitable operations part of our business is focused on developing information based and other products and services to assist pharmaceutical companies in a new and unproven area the identification and correlation of variation in genetic composition to disease and drug response 
we will incur significant costs over the next several years in expanding our research and development in this area 
these activities may never generate significant revenues or profitable operations 
this aspect of our business focuses on single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps  one type of genetic variation 
the role of snps in disease and drug response is not fully understood  and relatively few  if any  therapeutic or diagnostic products based on snps have been developed and commercialized 
among other things  demand in this area may be adversely affected by ethical and social concerns about the confidentiality of patient specific genetic information and about the use of genetic testing for diagnostic purposes 
except for a few anecdotal examples  there is no proof that snps have any correlation to diseases or a patient s response to a particular drug or class of drug 
identifying statistically significant correlations is time consuming and could involve the collection and screening of a large number of patient samples 
we do not know if the snps we have discovered to date are suitable for these correlation studies because the variations we discovered may not occur frequently enough to justify use by a pharmaceutical company 
our success in this area will also depend upon our ability to develop  use and enhance new and relatively unproven technologies 
among other things  we will need to continue to improve the throughput of our snp discovery technology 
we may not be able to achieve these necessary improvements  and other factors may impair our ability to develop our snp related products and services in time to be competitively available 
if our strategic investments result in losses  our earnings may decline we make strategic investments in joint ventures or businesses that complement our business 
these investments may 
often be made in securities lacking a public trading market or subject to trading restrictions  either of which increases our risk and reduces the liquidity of our investment  
require us to record losses and expenses related to our ownership interest  such as the losses we reported in   and the first quarter of related to our investment in diadexus  llc  
require us to record charges related to the acquisition of in process technologies or for the impairment in the value of the securities underlying our investment  and 
require us to invest greater amounts than anticipated or to devote substantial management time to the management of research and development relationships and joint ventures 
the market values of many of these investments fluctuate significantly 
we evaluate our long term equity investments for impairment of their values on a quarterly basis 
impairment could result in future charges to our earnings 
these losses and expenses may exceed the amounts that we anticipated 
because our sales cycle is lengthy  we may spend a lot of time and money trying to obtain new or renewed subscriptions to our products and services but may be unsuccessful  which could hurt our profitability our ability to obtain new subscribers for our databases  software tools and microarray and other services or to obtain renewals or additions to existing subscriptions depends upon prospective subscribers perceptions that our products and services can help accelerate drug discovery efforts 
our database sales cycle is typically lengthy because we need to educate our potential subscribers and sell the benefits of our tools and services to a variety of constituencies within potential subscriber companies 
in addition  each database subscription and microarray services agreement involves the negotiation of unique terms 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort with no assurance that a new  renewed or expanded subscription or services agreement will result 
these expenditures  without increased revenues  will negatively impact our profitability 
actual and proposed consolidations of pharmaceutical companies have affected the timing and progress of our sales efforts 
we expect that future proposed consolidations will have similar effects 
if we encounter problems in meeting customers software needs  our revenues could decline and we could lose our customers goodwill our databases require software support and will need to incorporate features determined by database collaborators 
if we experience delays or difficulties in implementing our database software or collaborator requested features  we may be unable to service our collaborators  which could result in a loss of revenues and customer goodwill 
we have encountered difficulties integrating companies we acquired  and if in the future we cannot smoothly integrate businesses we acquire  our operations and financial results could be harmed in december  we acquired proteome  inc as part of our business strategy  we may acquire other assets  technologies and businesses 
our past acquisitions have involved and our future acquisitions may involve risks such as the following 
we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  
our acquisition and integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  
we may experience difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  disrupting our business and diverting management s time and attention  
we may be unable to integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology  
we may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  
our relationships with key customers of acquired businesses may be impaired  due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  
we may be unable to retain key employees of the acquired businesses  
we may incur amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets  and 
our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities 
in addition  if we acquire additional businesses that are not located near our palo alto  california headquarters  we may experience more difficulty integrating and managing the acquired businesses operations 
if we are unable to manage effectively our growth  our operations and ability to support our customers could be affected  which could harm our revenues we may continue to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
our ability to manage this growth will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain skilled employees 
our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems and to hire  train and manage our employees 
in addition  we must continue to invest in customer support resources as the number of database collaborators and their requests for support increase 
our database collaborators typically have worldwide operations and may require support at multiple us and foreign sites 
to provide this support  we may need to open offices in additional locations  which could result in additional burdens on our systems and resources 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to achieve our objectives we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff 
our product development  operations and marketing efforts would be delayed or curtailed if we lose the services of any of these people 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific  software  bioinformatics and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire  train and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing and sales staff 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
if we are unable to continue to attract  train and retain these personnel  we may be unable to expand our business 
we rely on a small number of suppliers of products we need for our business  and if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies  we will be unable to compete effectively currently  we use gene sequencing machines supplied by molecular dynamics  a subsidiary of amersham pharmacia biotech  ltd  and chemicals used in the sequencing process  called reagents  supplied by sigma aldrich  inc in our gene sequencing operations 
if we are not able to obtain additional machines or an adequate supply of reagents or other materials at commercially reasonable rates  our ability to identify genes or genetic variations would be slower and more expensive 
if the information we obtain from third party data sources is corrupt or violates the law  our revenues and operating results could decline we rely on and include in our databases scientific and other data supplied by others  including publicly available information from sources such as the human genome project 
this data could contain errors or other defects  which could corrupt our databases 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that our data sources acquired this information in compliance with legal requirements 
if this data caused database corruption or violated legal requirements  we would be unable to sell subscriptions to our databases 
these lost sales would harm our revenue and operating results 
security risks in electronic commerce or unfavorable internet regulations may deter future use of our products and services  which could result in a loss of revenues we offer several products through our website on the internet and may offer additional products in the future 
our ability to provide secure transmissions of confidential information over the internet may limit online use of our products and services by our database collaborators as we may be limited by our inability to provide secure transmissions of confidential information over the internet 
advances in computer capabilities and new discoveries in the field of cryptography may comprise the security measures we use to protect our website  access to our databases  and transmissions to and from our website 
if our security measures are breached  our proprietary information or confidential information about our collaborators could be misappropriated 
also  a security breach could result in interruptions in our operations 
the security measures we adopt may not be sufficient to prevent breaches  and we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
further  if the security of our website  or the website of another company  is breached  our collaborators may no longer use the internet when the transmission of confidential information is involved 
for example  recent attacks by computer hackers on major e commerce websites and other internet service providers have heightened concerns regarding the security and reliability of the internet 
because of the growth in electronic commerce  the united states congress has held hearings on whether to further regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
the federal government could enact laws  rules and regulations that would affect our business and operations 
individual states could also enact laws regulating the use of the internet 
if enacted  these federal and state laws  rules and regulations could require us to change our online business and operations  which could limit our growth and our development of our online products 
our customers may not consider the internet as an acceptable method for accessing our products and services we have expended a significant amount of time and money to make our products available through the internet 
in  we introduced our on line product lifeseq gene by gene and made lifeseq gold and lifeexpress available on line 
if only a few of our customers choose to use the internet as a method for accessing our products and services  we may have to incur a charge against earnings to write off internet related assets 
because our activities involve the use of hazardous materials  we may be subject to costly environmental liability that could exceed our resources our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages  and this liability could exceed our resources 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations and currently do not expect to make material additional capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near term 
however  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 
because our revenues are derived primarily from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  our revenues may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures we expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as to the academic community 
accordingly  our success will depend in large part upon the success of the companies within these industries and their demand for our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries or by the academic community 
these reductions and delays may result from factors such as 
changes in economic conditions  
consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  
changes in the regulatory environment  including governmental pricing controls  affecting health care and health care providers  
pricing pressures  
market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and 
other factors affecting research and development spending 
these factors are not within our control 
if a natural disaster occurs  we may have to cease or limit our business operations we conduct our database  sequencing and a significant portion of our other activities at our facilities in palo alto  california  and conduct our microarray related activities at our facilities in fremont  california 
both locations are in a seismically active area 
although we maintain business interruption insurance  we do not have or plan to obtain earthquake insurance 
a major catastrophe  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  could result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
we may experience power blackouts and higher electricity prices as a result of california s current energy crisis  which could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
we rely on the major northern california public utility  pacific gas electric company  or pg e  to supply electric power to our facilities in northern california 
due to problems associated with the de regulation of the power industry in california and shortages in wholesale electricity supplies  customers of pg e have been faced with increased electricity prices  power shortages and  in some cases  rolling blackouts 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we may be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could delay our ability to develop or provide our products and services  which could damage our reputation and result in lost revenue  either of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests as of december   we had 
total consolidated debt of approximately million  
stockholders equity of approximately million  and 
a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges of million for the year ended december  a variety of uncertainties and contingencies will affect our future performance  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including our debt service requirements with respect to our convertible subordinated notes due that we sold in february at december   million of those notes were outstanding 
the following table shows  as of december   the aggregate amount of our interest payments due in each of the next five years listed aggregate year interest our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including 
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  
requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  
limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or 
placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its investments in short term marketable securities 
the company s investment policy calls for investment in short term  low risk instruments 
as of december   investments in marketable securities were million 
due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
the company is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in its portfolio of investments and long term investments  entered into to further its business and strategic objectives 
these investments are in small capitalization stocks in the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry sector  in companies with which the company has research and development or licensing agreements 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
as of december   long term investments were million 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its foreign operations are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
all of the company s revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not enter into forward exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign currency exchange risk on transactions denominated in foreign currencies or for speculative or trading purposes 
if currency exchange rates were to fluctuate immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the impact to the company s financial position or results of operations would not be material
