the company s current products  known as the i stat r system  consist of portable  hand held analyzers and single use disposable cartridges  each of which simultaneously performs different combinations of commonly ordered blood tests in approximately two minutes 
the i stat system also includes peripheral components that enable the results of tests to be transmitted by infrared means to both a proprietary information system for managing the user s point of care testing program and to the user s information systems for billing and archiving 
the i stat system currently performs blood tests for sodium  potassium  chloride  glucose  creatinine  urea nitrogen  hematocrit  ionized calcium  lactate  celite r act activated clotting time  arterial blood gases  and bicarbonate  and derives certain other values  such as total carbon dioxide  base excess  anion gap  hemoglobin and o saturation  by calculation from the tests performed 
the company continues to engage in research and development in order to improve its existing products and develop new products based on the i stat system technology 
the company currently is developing three additional tests for the measurement of coagulation kaolin act  partial thromboplastin time aptt  and prothombin time pt 
the company is also studying the development of cardiac marker tests 
in the fourth quarter of  the company introduced an analyzer and associated peripheral equipment  which  in addition to having the measurement capabilities possessed by the i stat system  incorporates the glucose measurement capabilities of an abbott laboratories abbott product

the deferred revenue reflects the receipt of the million prepayment from abbott  along with the reclassification of the first abbott prepayment of million from deferred revenue long term to deferred revenue current  partially offset by the amortization of such prepayments to income as incremental cartridge sales as defined in the distribution agreement with abbott are generated

international sales are invoiced and settled in us dollars 
however  the cartridge price received from international partners  including abbott  may be affected by changes in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies 
this is because the international cartridge price is set based on the price paid by customers in local currencies 
when the value of foreign currencies changes with respect to the us dollar  the price changes due to the foreign exchange conversion of local currency prices 
price reductions are limited  however  by guaranteed minimum prices established for each cartridge 
the company s cartridge production is conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary in canada 
most manufacturing labor and overhead costs of this subsidiary are incurred in canadian currency funded by us dollar transfers from the united states each week  while most raw material purchases are in us dollars 
in  the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation increased by approximately million to approximately million  and reflects the adjustment to translate the canadian subsidiary s balance sheet to us dollars at the december  exchange rate
