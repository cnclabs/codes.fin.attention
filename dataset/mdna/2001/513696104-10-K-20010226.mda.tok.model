item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of the consolidated statements of income the consolidated statements of income present lamson sessions operating performance over the last three years 
results of operations net sales increased in to million from million in representing a growth rate 
excluding the two acquisitions made by the company during the year net sales would have increased by or million 
all three business segments experienced healthy growth during this year 
carlon grew by million or primarily from the pyramid and ameriduct acquisitions  which added million in combined net sales 
this business unit generated a growth from its core electrical and telecommunications products reflecting price increases early in the year and modest market growth 
lamson home products increased its net sales level by million or over to million 
this improvement in the top line is almost entirely from additional business at the unit s second largest customer as price increases were negligible 
the pvc pipe business had an outstanding year as sales increased by or million to million 
these results reflect a increase in selling price per unit as resin costs were up by an average of during versus the company gave up market share to maintain material spreads as the construction market was very strong throughout the first half of this year 
telecommunications duct volume was up by this year  the mix improving from predominantly electrical conduit to a more balanced product distribution 
sales of large diameter sewer pipe have continued to decline due to extremely competitive pricing in the direct bury product lines lower than 
however  the targeted rehabilitation pipe products have expanded rapidly this year  almost doubling in sales value 
net sales increased in by to million from million in the largest increase came in the carlon business unit  which expanded sales by or million 
the segment has continued to gain market acceptance of its engineered cable management products used in telecommunications network construction both for inside premise and outside plant applications 
strong construction markets and improved customer service led to solid growth across the board in electrical products 
lamson home products grew net sales by or million in compared with continued strong growth in the home improvement market drove improved sales volume in electrical fittings  outlet boxes and liquidtight tubing 
this segment was negatively impacted for by the hechinger s bankruptcy as well as the elimination of unprofitable wiring device products 
finally  the pvc pipe business increased sales by  with electrical and telecommunications conduit growing by  primarily from increased resin costs  which we were able to pass on to our customers 
this segment was negatively impacted by unexpected pvc resin shortages during the third quarter  which limited its supply of conduit to the electrical construction market 
in addition  sales in large diameter sewer pipe declined by due to increased competition and a softening demand for rehabilitation pipe 
gross margins grew by over to in compared with in this improvement was a result of better margins in both the carlon and the pvc pipe businesses from price increases and product mix improvements 
overall distribution and freight costs were around million less on a comparable basis to primarily due to the consolidation of distribution operations completed last year and effective management of freight surcharges incurred in gross margins were in  a slight improvement from the in the cost of products sold includes million of costs for the consolidation of distribution operations 
they consist primarily of associate relocation  training and start up costs and asset dispositions 
better product mix  distribution and freight savings were partially offset by unfavorable volume variances caused by the raw material shortages experienced during the peak construction season 
operating expenses were million in million higher than or of net sales compared with of net sales in continued productivity improvements in general administrative activities offset increases in sales commission and legal  professional and acquisition related expenses 
the result was more than a two and a half times increase in operating income to million of net sales in versus million of net sales in operating expenses in declined to of net sales or million  lower than the in the company continued to experience productivity improvements from its infrastructure investments in management information systems and associate training programs  which resulted in lower staffing levels 
with the exception of 
table of contents higher commission expense due to increased sales  operating expenses actually declined by from operating income improved by almost to million in of net sales compared with million of net sales in interest expense increased by a million dollars in due to the acquisition debt added late in the year 
the new debt agreement entered into in august  lowered the company s average borrowing rate by over one percentage point 
in  the interest expense had declined as a result of lower average debt levels and lower interest rates from improved operating performance 
the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was million for  almost double the million ebitda earned in financial condition working capital was million at the end of compared with million at the end of the current ratio increased to in from in as accounts receivable and inventory balances grew more than current related payables 
cash flow generated from operating activities was a strong million in versus million in these results reflect the significant improvement in operating results this year  which offset a million increase in inventory 
accounts receivable were million at the end of  which includes in receivables from the acquisitions  compared with million at the end of days sales outstanding were about this year compared with days for inventory levels at the end of were million compared with million at the end of of this million increase  million is inventory acquired in the pyramid and ameriduct purchases 
almost the entire remaining increase has occurred in the pvc pipe business as pounds of resin are up almost from the low level at the end of last year  while resin pricing at the end of is relatively the same as the prior year end 
accounts payable at year end were approximately the same million as last year  as the company has decreased its purchasing activity in the last quarter to help adjust its inventory levels going into next year 
the current balance in deferred tax assets increased due to improved operating results allowing the company to utilize net operating losses to reduce current expected tax payments 
accrued expenses reflect acquired liabilities to be paid in the next year and the expectation that outstanding legal cases will be resolved in the next year 
the current portion of long term debt has increased to reflect the amortization schedule of term debt provided in the new credit agreement 
the company completed the refinancing of its debt during to provide up to million in a five year facility with a ten bank consortium of which million is a term loan 
during the year the company utilized in excess of million for the acquisitions of pyramid and ameriduct 
excluding these acquisitions  the company would have paid down nearly million in debt 
capital expenditures totaled million in compared with million in the current year spending was primarily for conduit extrusion capacity additions  distribution center productivity  new product tooling and quality enhancements 
outlook the following paragraphs contain forward looking comments 
the comments are subject to  and the actual future results may be impacted by  the cautionary limitations and factors outlined in the following narrative comments 
we began to express caution with respect to the moderating effects on the general economy of interest rate increases in our form q filings and quarterly earnings releases throughout the general level of economic activity slowed dramatically in the fourth quarter of and this slowing has continued into the first quarter of  especially in the telecommunications market where funding sources for infrastructure development projects were sharply contracted or eliminated 
on january   in our fourth quarter earnings release and web cast conference call  we outlined our expectations for both the first quarter and full year which reflected the best information available to us at that time from economic data as well as input from customers and our sales force 
since then  we have experienced a significantly lower sales order rate which now causes us to reduce our earnings estimate accordingly 
recent announcements by major telecommunications companies lowering their growth forecasts and recognizing the severity of the economic slowdown are having an effect on our performance 
the sales order activity from the telecommunication infrastructure market has fallen precipitously in light of the slowing or deferral of outside plant construction projects including the installation of fiber optic backbone networks over the past several weeks 
while we continue to believe that the telecom infrastructure market s prospects over the next two or three years are projected to be good  the near term decline reflects a combination of conservative capital spending and difficulty in gaining firm financing agreements as a result of general credit tightening measures 
our carlon business segment encompasses both the telecom market and the residential and commercial construction markets 
while the telecom activity has slowed  we are encouraged by the continuing strength in housing permits and housing starts  which should begin to favorably impact our results in the second quarter 
the dramatic fall in consumer confidence  its lowest level in seven years  is likely to reduce the growth target of our lamson home products business segment as evidenced by recent public statements by its largest customer  home depot 
the pvc pipe business segment is highly sensitive to commodity raw material pricing volatility 
currently  margins are very tight due to aggressive competition trying to defend market share positions in a climate of soft demand 

table of contents the length and depth of the economic slowing are problematic to estimate  at best 
the spring months should bring some increased spending simply due to seasonal factors 
if the economy begins to respond to the interest rate reductions over the next several months  we believe that some of the wait and see conservatism will abate and more capital spending will begin to flow in the second half of we previously disclosed a projected sales level of to million for the first quarter of which would likely result in an earnings range of cents to cents per diluted share 
as a result of the factors described above  we now project an million to million sales range resulting in earnings of cents to cents per diluted share for the first quarter of this revised earnings level reflects the reduction in plant operating rates  particularly for high density polyethylene hdpe conduit that has resulted in unabsorbed fixed costs creating higher manufacturing variances 
for the full year  we have previously indicated a range of million to million in net sales and an earnings range of to per diluted share 
while we anticipate that demand will begin to strengthen in the second quarter  in light of the projected weaker first quarter described above and continued competitive pricing  we are revising our projection for the full year to a net sales range of million to million and net earnings of to per diluted share 
the volume levels currently being experienced  and those projected for the balance of the year  effectively preclude the company from sustaining growth in earnings per share for we are disappointed that low volume will prevent the company from fully demonstrating the improved performance made possible by continued progress in cost reduction and operating efficiency 
even at the reduced volume  which is now projected  the ebitda level for is projected to exceed ebitda for by million 
for  the increase projected in ebitda is offset by the projected increase of million in interest expense resulting from the increased borrowings to finance the company s two recent acquisitions as well as projected increased charges of million and million for amortization of goodwill and income taxes  respectively
