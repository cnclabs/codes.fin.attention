item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december    and in addition  this section contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are set forth below in the investment considerations section 
general we are a specialty finance company that originates and services loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial loans 
we have a leading position in taxicab medallion financing 
since  we have increased our medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of and our commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 
our total assets under our management was approximately million and has grown from million at the end of  a compound annual growth rate of 
medallion s loan related earnings depend primarily on its level of net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the total yield on medallion s loan portfolio and the average cost of funds 
medallion funds its operations through a wide variety of interest bearing sources  such as revolving bank facilities  secured commercial paper  senior secured notes and debentures issued to and guaranteed by the sba 
net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on medallion s loan portfolio and changes in the cost of funds  as well as changes in the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities held by medallion 
net interest income is also affected by economic  regulatory and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and the availability of funding to finance medallion s lending activities 
medallion  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice on a different basis than its interest bearing liabilities 
medallion originates loans under the section a loan program of the sba through its wholly owned subsidiary bll 
up to of the amount of these loans up to  are guaranteed by the sba 
medallion regularly sells the guaranteed portion of these loans in the secondary market and holds the non guaranteed portion until maturity 
medallion also invests in small businesses in selected industries through its subsidiary medallion capital 
medallion capital s investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price such warrants are included in equity investments 
interest income is earned on the debt investments 
realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off 
the realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets  if any  and the cost of such portfolio assets 
in addition  changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period 
generally  realized gains losses on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments are inversely related 
when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs 
conversely  when a loss previously recorded as an unrealized loss is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes an increase in net unrealized appreciation and an increase in realized loss 
medallion s income from the taxicab rooftop advertising business  operated by media  is reflected on medallion s books as earnings from an unconsolidated subsidiary 
medallion continues to explore other opportunities in the taxicab and lending industries  including possible strategies to participate directly and or indirectly in the appreciation of taxicab medallions 
trend in loan portfolio medallion s investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on its loan portfolio 
to identify trends in the yields  the portfolio is grouped by medallion loans  commercial loans  and equity investments 
since december   medallion loans  while still making up a significant portion of the total portfolio  have decreased in relation to the total portfolio composition and commercial loans have increased 
the following table illustrates medallion s investments at fair value and the weighted average portfolio yields calculated using the contractual interest rates of the loans at the dates indicated december  december  december  contractual contractual contractual weighted percentage weighted percentage weighted percentage average principal of total average principal of total average principal of total in thousands yield amount portfolio yield amount portfolio yield amount portfolio medallion loan portfolio    commercial loan portfolio    equity investments    total portfolio    portfolio summary total portfolio yield the weighted average yield of the total portfolio at december  was  which is an increase of basis points from at december  the increase in the total portfolio yield was due to the increased yield of the commercial loan portfolio and the shift in the composition of the portfolio to an increased percentage of commercial loans 
the total weighted average portfolio yield decreased basis point to at december  from at december  this slight decline resulted from the decrease in the yields of the medallion and commercial loan portfolios  but was offset by an increased percentage of commercial loans in medallion s portfolio 
medallion expects to try to continue increasing both the percentage of commercial loans in the total portfolio and the origination of floating and adjustable rate loans and non new york medallion loans 
medallion loan portfolio medallion loans comprised of the total portfolio of million at december   compared to of the total portfolio of million at december  and of the total portfolio of million at december  the medallion loan portfolio decreased by million or in  reflecting a decrease in medallion loan originations  principally in new york city  and medallion s execution of participation agreements with third parties for million of low yielding new york medallion loans 
medallion retains a portion of these participating loans and earns a fee for servicing the loans for the third parties 
the decrease was partially offset by increased originations of chicago and boston medallion loans 
the weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at december  was  an increase of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the increased yield in primarily reflects medallion s expansion into markets outside of new york  which produce yields to basis points higher than loans originated in the new york medallion market  offset by the effects of continuing competition in the new york medallion market 
at december   of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york compared to and at year end and  respectively 
medallion continues to focus its efforts on originating higher yielding medallion loans outside the new york market 
collateral appreciation participation loans during the first half  we originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of million  of which million was syndicated to other financial institutions 
in consideration for modifications from our normal taxi medallion lending terms  we offered loans at higher loan to value ratios and we are entitled to earn additional interest income based upon any increase in the value of all million of the collateral 
the fair value of the collateral appreciation participation loan portfolio at december  was million  which represented of the total loan portfolio 
additional interest income totaled approximately million for  and is included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations and in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the additional interest income recorded is fully realizable through operation of the collateral or orderly sales in the market 
as a regulated investment company  medallion is required to mark to market these investments on a quarterly basis  just as it does on all of its other investments 
medallion feels that it has adequately calculated the fair market value on these investments and relies upon information such as recent and historical medallion sale prices 
if there is a decrease in the value of taxicab medallions  the reduction in the value of the investments will be reversed against investment income 
the additional interest income is not reflected in the yield calculations shown in the table above 
commercial loan portfolio since  medallion has continued to shift the total portfolio mix toward a higher percentage of commercial loans  which historically have had higher yields than its medallion loans 
commercial loans were of the total portfolio at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the commercial loan portfolio was due to strong growth in the sba section a loan program and in the asset based lending portfolio 
the weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at december  was  an increase of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the increase in and the decrease in primarily reflected a shift in the mix within the commercial portfolio from fixed rate loans to floating rate or adjustable rate loans tied to the prime rate  and the corresponding sensitivity of the yield to movements in the prime rate 
medallion continues to originate adjustable rate and floating rate loans tied to the prime rate to help mitigate its interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
at december   floating rate loans represented approximately of the commercial portfolio compared to and at december  and although this strategy initially produces a lower yield  we believe that this strategy mitigates interest rate risk by better matching our earning assets to their adjustable rate funding sources 
equity investments equity investments were   and of medallion s total portfolio at december    and equity investments are comprised of common stock and warrants 
trend in interest expense medallion s interest expense is driven by the interest rate payable on its libor based short term credit facilities with bank syndicates  long term notes payable and  to a lesser degree  secured commercial paper and fixed rate  long term debentures issued to or guaranteed by the sba 
the following table provides the interest rates and interest expense of medallion s major credit facilities for the years ended december    and percentage actual of total interest interest average cost of funds expense expense december  notes payable to banks  commercial paper  senior secured notes  sba debentures  total  december  notes payable to banks  commercial paper  senior secured notes  sba debentures  total  december  notes payable to banks  commercial paper  sba debentures  total  in recent years  medallion has reduced its reliance on sba financing in favor of bank debt and other funding sources 
medallion will continue to seek sba funding  however to the extent it offers attractive rates 
sba financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur 
accordingly  medallion plans to limit its use of sba funding to the subsidiary level to fund loans that qualify under the sbia and sba regulations 
further  medallion believes that its transition to financing operations primarily with short term libor based secured bank debt and secured commercial paper has generally decreased its interest expense  but has also increased medallion s exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates  which medallion attempts to mitigate with certain hedging strategies 
at december  and december   short term libor based debt including commercial paper constituted and of total debt  respectively 
medallion s cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on its various debt instruments and their relative mix and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding 
medallion incurs libor based debt for terms generally ranging from to days 
medallion s debentures issued to or guaranteed by the sba typically have initial terms of ten years 
medallion s cost of funds reflects changes in libor to a greater degree than in the past because libor based debt represents a greater proportion of medallion s debt 
medallion measures its cost of funds as its aggregate interest expense for all of its interest bearing liabilities divided by the face amount of such liabilities 
medallion analyzes its cost of funds in relation to the average of the and day libor the libor benchmark 
medallion s average cost of funds for was  up from in  reflecting the higher rate environment resulting from the series of rate increases initiated by the federal reserve board 
during december  medallion s outstanding commercial paper began to mature and was replaced by draws on the notes payable to banks at a cost of approximately  as compared to a cost of under the commercial paper program 
the commercial paper was not renewed as a result of the loss of a credit rating due to the merger of the two rating agencies providing credit ratings to medallion and due to the remaining rating agency placing medallion s rating on negative credit watch 
taxicab advertising in addition to its finance business  medallion also conducts a taxicab rooftop advertising business through media  which began operations in november media s revenue is affected by the number of taxicab rooftop advertising displays  currently showing advertisements  and the rate charged customers for those displays 
at december   media had approximately  installed displays 
medallion expects that media will continue to expand its operations by entering new markets on its own or through acquisition of existing taxicab rooftop advertising companies 
although media is a wholly owned subsidiary of medallion  its results of operations are not consolidated with medallion s operations because the securities and exchange commission regulations prohibit the consolidation of non investment companies with investment companies 
on august   media entered into an agreement for up to ten years with yellow cab service corp  the taxi division of coach usa  the leading taxi and bus charter company in the us  to sell advertising space on the top of over  taxicabs throughout the united states 
going forward  as coach usa acquires taxi companies around the us  media will have the right to place advertisements on top of those taxis as well 
on august   media purchased all the assets of out there media llc out there  a privately held company headquartered in cleveland 
out there has the right to place an advertisement on top of more than taxis in cleveland  columbus  and toledo  and has contracts with some of the largest taxi fleets in these cities 
on february   we announced that media entered into an agreement to acquire taxi media network  the largest taxicab advertising company in japan  which holds the rights to provide advertising on  taxis in japan 
the transaction is subject to due diligence reviews and other customary closing conditions 
factors affecting net assets factors that affect medallion s net assets include  net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments 
net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment 
change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments is the amount  if any  by which medallion s estimate of the fair value of its investment portfolio is above below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio 
under the act and the sbia  medallion s loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value 
unlike certain lending institutions  medallion is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses  but adjusts quarterly the valuation of our loan portfolio to reflect medallion s estimate of the current value of the total loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for medallion s loans  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of medallion 
in determining such fair value  medallion and its board of directors takes into consideration factors such as the financial condition of its borrowers and the adequacy of its collateral 
any change in the fair value of portfolio loans or other investments as determined by medallion is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation of investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and the year was a year of maturity for the company as cumulative growing pains from prior years were addressed and the company began a new commitment to operational and financial excellence 
steps taken included the resolution of the material weaknesses identified from the financial audit  the hiring of a strong new cadre of senior management  the initiating of a dialogue with the company s lending syndicates as to borrowing conditions  and the reassessment of strategic initiatives both underway and anticipated in the future 
as a result of this process  the company recorded adjustments against net investment income of million reflecting a number of one time adjustments relating to acquisition related matters million  the termination of certain capital markets activities million  and the costs of amending our borrowing agreements with our bank group million 
as reported  net increase in net assets resulting from operations was million or per share in  a decrease of million or from million or per share in  primarily reflecting the one time adjustments described above and the impact of the radio one  inc investment gain of million recorded in as a result of radio one s initial public offering completed during the three months ended june  adjusting for the effects of these unusual items  net increase in net assets resulting from operations was million or per share in  compared to million or per share in  an increase of million or  reflecting increased net interest and non interest income  complemented by a sharp reduction in net unrealized depreciation on investments  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
return on average assets and return on average equity for were and and adjusted for the unusual items  respectively  compared to and and adjusted for the radio one investment gain for investment income was million in the year  up million or from million in the increase compared to reflected both the higher level of interest rates in the economy during and the increased level of loans  coupled with additional interest income recorded on the collateral appreciation participation loans 
net investments grew or to million in from million in the yield on the total portfolio at december  was  an increase of basis points compared with a yield of a year ago 
the increase primarily reflects the series of rate hikes initiated by the federal reserve bank during late and continuing through most of the impact of the higher yield increased investment income by approximately million in also impacting the improvement in investment income was the continuing movement of portfolio composition towards higher yielding commercial loans from lower yielding medallion loans 
yields on medallion loans at year end were up from in  and the yields on commercial loans were at year end up from in 
as rates began to rise  management made a conscious effort to sell or not renew these typically fixed  lower rate medallion loans and replace them with floating  higher rate commercial loans 
medallion loans were million at december   down million or from million in  primarily reflecting a reduction in new york city medallion loans  partly offset by increased medallion loans in other markets  especially in chicago and boston 
the commercial loan portfolio was million at year end  compared to million a year earlier  an increase of million or 
the increases were in most commercial lending categories  including million in the asset based lending business and million in the sba a lending program 
the balance of the commercial loan increase was spread amongst many generic commercial lending categories  including restaurants  real estate  mezzanine financing  and other small business pursuits 
during the first half  we originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of million  of which million was syndicated to other financial institutions 
in consideration for modifications from our normal taxi medallion lending terms  we offered loans at higher loan to value ratios  and we are entitled to earn additional interest income based upon any increase in the value of the taxi medallion collateral on the entire million portfolio 
the value of chicago taxi medallions increased during  and accordingly  additional interest of million was recorded as investment income for interest expense was million in  up million or compared to  primarily reflecting increased borrowing levels  coupled with the impact of an increased interest rate environment 
during  medallion completed the leveraging of its equity base by essentially fully drawing down the existing bank lines of credit  resulting in an increase in debt outstanding of million or to million 
the increase in average debt outstanding was million  a increase compared to in addition to the higher borrowing levels  medallion s debt is primarily tied to floating rate indexes  which rose during most of as a result  the average cost of funds was in  compared to in  a increase of basis points 
approximately of medallion s debt is short term and floating rate  up slightly from in net interest income was million for  up million or from  primarily reflecting the additional interest recorded on the collateral appreciation participation loans 
excluding those amounts  net interest income was up million or  reflecting the relatively greater increase in the level of debt outstanding compared to the growth in the loan portfolio  coupled with a reduction in the net interest spread from the increase in borrowing costs which outpaced the increase in yield on the loan portfolio 
medallion had gains on the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba a loans of million in  down million or from million in during  million of loans were sold under the sba program compared to million during the decline in gains on sale reflected a decrease in loans sold of million or  along with a decrease in the level of market determined premiums received on the sales 
equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiary reflects the operations of the media division of medallion 
the losses of million in increased million from losses of million in  and reflected the greater costs associated with the rapid increase in tops under contract and cities serviced  which outpaced the million or increase in revenue 
during  vehicles under contract increased  or to  from  in negative goodwill was fully accreted during  and accordingly  accretion of million in declined from million in other income of million increased million from million in  primarily reflecting an increase of million in servicing fee income  as well as increases in prepayment fees  late charges  and other miscellaneous income 
non interest expense was million  up million or  from million in included in the amounts for were million of costs related to the freshstart acquisition  and write offs of million for costs related to acquisitions that were terminated during the year  million of other costs associated with capital markets activities  million related to a spin off of an operating division that was terminated  and million related to a postponed asset securitization 
excluding these amounts  non interest expense was million  up million or from salaries and benefits expense of million was up million or  reflecting normal salary increases and the impact of new senior management hires 
professional fees of million were up million or from million in up million or excluding the write offs of certain of the costs described above  reflecting higher audit costs in  and consultation on systems development and a variety of business development initiatives 
merger related expense of million in reflects the costs associated with the freshstart merger and the write off of costs capitalized in connection with two acquisitions that were contracted in  but which were subsequently terminated 
amortization of goodwill was million in  essentially unchanged from administration and advisory fees were million in  down million or from million in  reflecting the completion of the advisory services contract 
other operating expenses of million were up million or up million or excluding the write offs of certain of the costs described above from million in the increase was generally spread among many operating areas of the company  and included write offs related to a general cleanup of operations  increased rent  and higher depreciation  advertising  bank charges  and miscellaneous other operating expenses 
as reported  net investment income after taxes in was million  down million or from net investment income of million in  reflecting the results of operations described above 
excluding the impact of the unusual items previously mentioned  net investment income after taxes was million  up million or from net unrealized appreciation on investments was million in  compared to net unrealized depreciation of million in  an increase of million 
unrealized appreciation depreciation arises when medallion makes valuation adjustments to the investment portfolio 
when investments are sold or written off  any resulting realized gain loss is grossed up to reflect previously recorded unrealized components 
as a result  movement between periods can appear distorted 
the increase in activity primarily resulted from the reversal of unrealized depreciation related to realized losses of million compared to activity which included the reversal of unrealized appreciation related to the radio one gain in of million  along with a net increase in unrealized depreciation of million in net realized loss on investments in was million  compared to a net gain of million in  a decrease of million 
most of the decrease related to the sale of medallion s radio one equity investment  which resulted in a realized gain of million 
aside from radio one  medallion sold another equity investment in  which resulted in a loss of million 
the balance of the increase in of million represented the write off of various commercial loans that had previously been fully written down through the quarterly valuation adjustment process medallion s net realized unrealized loss on investments in was million  which primarily reflected losses on commercial loans  compared to a net realized unrealized loss in of million excluding the radio one transaction which primarily represented increased valuation allowances for commercial loans 
for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   net increase in net assets resulting from operations was positively impacted by growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in realized gains from the sale of common and preferred stock warrants  offset by an increase in interest and operating expenses 
investment income increased million or in compared to the company s investment income reflects the positive impact of portfolio growth during the year 
total portfolio growth was million or from million at december  to million at december  the overall increase in investment income of million was primarily the result of higher outstanding loan levels with a higher percentage of loans in the commercial installment lending portfolio  which generated higher yields than medallion loans 
the lower yield on the medallion portfolio partially offset the increase in the investment income total loan originations  net of participations  increased by million or to million in  compared to million in the weighted average end of period yield of the entire portfolio was essentially unchanged at at december  compared to at december  the medallion loan portfolio yield at year end was  compared to in  a decrease of basis points caused by a reduction in yields due to increased competition and refinancing by borrowers at lower rates 
the commercial portfolio yield declined basis points to from in reflecting a shift in the number of loans tied to prime at lower yields as a percentage of the commercial portfolio  compared to the older higher yielding fixed rate loans 
in addition  the current interest rate environment was such that the company shortened maturity dates on new loans 
shorter maturity loans typically have lower rates than longer maturity loans  however  the shorter maturity dates helps reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the company s interest expense was million  an increase of million or from the company s end of period average cost of funds increased basis points to from at december  the increase was caused by an basis point increase in the libor benchmark 
also contributing to the increase in cost of funds end of period was an increase in the company s issuance of libor based bank debt  in place of commercial paper  which was generally priced approximately basis points higher than the company s commercial paper 
average total borrowings increased million or to million in  producing interest expense of million at a weighted average interest rate of compared to million in  which produced interest expense of million at a weighted average interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rates include commitment fees and amortization of premiums on existing interest rate cap agreements 
the percentage of the company s short term libor based secured indebtedness including secured commercial paper increased slightly as a percentage of total indebtedness to at december  from at december  the increase in the net interest income was primarily the result of the net increase in the principal outstanding in both the medallion and commercial loan portfolios in over of million and million respectively 
in  media generated net income of  which included approximately  of revenue from taxi top advertising sales to the company  compared to million in the decline is primarily the result of higher cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
advertising revenue increased million or to million in up from million in display rental costs increased million or to million in from million in this resulted in a gross margin in of approximately million or of advertising revenue compared to million or in the increase in advertising revenue and display rental cost is directly related to the increase in the number of displays owned by media 
the number of displays owned by media increased  or to approximately  at december  the million increase in revenue was partially offset by the shortfall in revenue resulting from the elimination of higher priced tobacco advertising with initially lower priced replacement contracts and a related lower average display occupancy in of down from in total operating expense increased by million in primarily due to increases in the following expense categories salary and benefits of  commission of  office supplies of  travel and entertainment of  these increases reflect the growth and expansion of the business 
the company experienced a gain on the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba a loans in the amount of million on loans sold for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the gain is the result of the increase in the sale of loans during the year of million for compared to million for  offset by a reduction in the premiums received for the sales 
the company s other income increased  or to million in other income was primarily derived from servicing fee income  late charges  prepayment fees and miscellaneous income 
approximately  of the increase is due to growth in servicing fee income on the guaranteed portion of sba loans sold in the secondary market 
prepayment fees are heavily influenced by the level and volatility of interest rates and competition 
accretion of negative goodwill was  in and the company s non interest expenses increased million or to million in salary and benefits increased million or  other operating expenses totaled million for an increase of  or and professional fees increased  or to million 
the increase in salary and benefits of million relates to the full year impact of staff changes  higher commissions  salary adjustments  changes which lower the recording of deferred loan origination costs  the full year impact of the medallion business credit operation which was partially in operation during  higher accruals related to special bonus payouts  and one time severance expense related to the chief operating officer s departure 
other operating expenses increase of  was primarily the result of  expense related to expenses incurred in reviewing the conversion of the company s loan system 
the increase in professional fees related to expenses incurred in reviewing potential acquisition candidates 
the operating expense ratio increased to for from for the operating expense ratio is computed as non interest expenses divided by total assets 
the amortization of goodwill was  in  compared to  in  and primarily related to acquisitions in connection with the initial public offering in net investment income was million in  a decrease of million or from million in the decrease was attributable to the million increase in interest expense due to a higher cost of funds in  higher non interest expenses of million  offset by an increase in investment income and non interest income of million and  respectively 
the change in net unrealized depreciation in was million as compared to a change in net unrealized appreciation of million in this change results from approximately million of net unrealized depreciation that was recognized when radio one stock owned by the company was sold which offset the previously recognized unrealized appreciation  and approximately million of net unrealized depreciation from additional loan loss reserves recorded 
the company had an increase in realized net gain on investments of million from million in to million in the increase in realized gains was the result of the sale of radio one stock held by the company 
net increase in net assets resulting from operations was million in  an increase of million or over the million earned in the increase was attributable to the positive impact of portfolio growth  an increase in realized gains offset by an increase in operating expenses and an increase in unrealized depreciation 
return on assets and return on equity for the year ended december   were and  respectively  compared to and for the year ended december  asset liability management interest rate sensitivity medallion  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion loans and commercial loans reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of credit facilities with bank syndicates  secured commercial paper  senior secured notes and subordinated sba debentures 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from medallion s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
medallion s interest rate sensitive assets were million and interest rate sensitive liabilities were million at december  the one year cumulative interest rate gap was negative million  or of interest rate sensitive assets 
having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  medallion anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
medallion believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
the following schedule of principal payments sets forth at december  the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the time periods indicated 
the principal amount of medallion loans and commercial loans are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be paid 
medallion has not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for medallion loans or commercial loans in this table 
more than more than more than more than and and and and less than less than less than less than less than dollars in thousands year years years years years thereafter total earnings assets medallion and commercial fixed rate loans        variable rate loans   cash   total earning assets        liabilities revolving line of credit   commercial paper   sba debentures      senior secured notes   total liabilities       interest rate gap        cumulative interest rate gap       interest rate cap agreements medallion seeks to manage the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by entering into interest rate cap agreements to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates and by incurring fixed rate debt consisting primarily of subordinated sba debentures 
we entered into an interest rate cap agreements limiting our maximum libor exposure on our revolving credit facility in accordance with the terms shown in the following table libor effective maturity amount rate date date total premiums paid under the interest rate cap agreements are being amortized over the respective terms of the agreements 
medallion will seek to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans  by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  by evaluating and purchasing  if appropriate  additional derivatives  and by revising  if appropriate  its overall level of asset and liability matching 
in addition  medallion manages its exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  such as five year senior secured notes and subordinated sba debentures 
medallion currently has outstanding million of senior secured notes maturing june   at a fixed interest rate of and sba debentures in the principal amount of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   these notes and debentures constituted and of medallion s total indebtedness respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity are credit facilities with bank syndicates  senior secured notes  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  our secured commercial paper program and loan amortization and prepayments 
as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
at december   our million of outstanding debt was comprised as follows bank debt  substantially all of which was at variable effective interest rates with an weighted average interest rate of  secured commercial paper with an annual weighted average interest rate of  long term senior secured notes fixed at an interest rate of  and subordinated sba debentures  with fixed rates of interest with an annual weighted average rate of 
medallion is eligible to seek sba funding and will seek such funding when the rates presented are advantageous in march  we applied for million of additional funding with the sba million to be committed by the sba  subject to our raising of additional equity capital 
this application is currently under review  although no assurance can be given that such funding will be obtained 
since sba financing subjects its recipients to certain regulations  medallion will seek funding at the subsidiary level to maximize its benefits 
currently  medallion has fully drawn down its existing bank lines of credit 
medallion has observed a practice of minimizing credit facility fees associated with the unused component of credit facilities by keeping the unused component as small as possible and periodically increasing the amounts available under such credit facilities only when necessary to fund portfolio growth 
additionally  medallion s lead member in the lending syndicate has approximately doubled its exposure to medallion and mfc to million as a result of a merger between such lead member and another bank in the lending syndicate in september this bank has asked medallion to find an additional participant to reduce its exposure 
medallion is actively seeking new members for the lending syndicate 
as a result  medallion is currently unable to expand its borrowing lines until new banks join the lending syndicate or a debt offering is completed 
this has limited medallion s ability to fund its originally planned level of loan originations 
medallion s bank and commercial paper facilities are subject to periodic reviews by the lending syndicate funding the borrowings and are also subject to certain covenants and restrictions 
as of december   we were in negotiations with both the bank group and the lenders of our senior secured notes on amendments to our existing loan agreements 
these amendments  which were finalized on march   granted medallion a waiver of compliance with certain provisions  clarified and revised certain provisions of the agreements related to business activities and financial covenants at medallion and mfc  and adjusted the rate of interest paid on the notes 
as of the effective date of the amendments  medallion believes it and mfc are in compliance with the requirements of the credit facilities  as amended  and expect to remain in compliance with the amended credit facilities for the forseeable future 
medallion  mfc  and their lenders have initiated discussions as to the next renewal of the existing bank loans which mature in june and september  although  there can be no assurances  the company expects a satisfactory result from these discussions 
on november   fitch ibca placed medallion s bbb senior secured debt rating and f secured commercial paper rating on negative watch 
in addition  in december  medallion s other rating agency  thompson s bankwatch  was acquired by fitch ibca  leaving it with only one commercial paper rating 
primarily as a result of these factors  a substantial portion of medallion s commercial paper did not rollover and has subsequently been replaced by medallion s bank facility 
on january   fitch ibca lowered our senior secured debt rating and secured commercial paper rating to bb and b  respectively  and removed them from negative watch 
medallion believes that its bank credit facilities and cash flow from operations after distributions to stockholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of medallion s loan portfolio and advertising business 
nevertheless  medallion continues to explore additional options  which may increase available funds for medallion s growth and expansion strategy 
in addition  to the application for sba funding described above  these financing options would provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
we are working with investment banking firms to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include an equity offering of securities  the sale or spin off of certain assets or divisions  and the development of a securitization conduit program 
these financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
if none of these financing options occur  management believes liquidity would still be adequate to fund the continuing operations of medallion s loan portfolio and advertising business 
deferred costs related to these financing options was approximately  as of december  and were included in other assets on medallion s consolidated balance sheets 
the following table illustrates sources of available funds for medallion and each of the subsidiaries  and amounts outstanding under credit facilities and their respective end of period weighted average interest rate at december medallion dollars in thousands financial mfc bll mcc mbc fsvc total cash       revolving lines of credit     amounts available   amounts outstanding     average interest rate maturity demand commercial paper   average interest rate maturity sba debentures    average interest rate maturity senior secured notes   average interest rate maturity total cash and amounts available under credit facilities       total debt outstanding      commercial paper outstanding is deducted from revolving credit lines available as the line of credit acts as a liquidity facility for the commercial paper 
loan amortization  prepayments  and sales also provide a source of funding for medallion 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  medallion loan market rates  economic conditions  and competition 
medallion loan prepayments have slowed since early  initially because of increases  and then stabilization  in the level of interest rates  and more recently because of an increase in the percentage of medallion loans  which are refinanced with medallion rather than through other sources of financing 
loan sales are a major focus of the sba section a loan program conducted by bll  which is primarily set up to originate and sell loans 
increases in sba a loan balances in any given period generally reflect timing differences in selling and closing transactions 
on june   mfc issued million of series a senior secured notes that mature on june   and on september   mfc issued million of series b senior secured notes that mature on september  together  the notes 
the notes bear a fixed rate of interest of and interest is paid quarterly in arrears 
the notes rank pari passu with the revolvers and commercial paper through inter creditor agreements the proceeds of the notes were used to prepay certain of the company s outstanding sba debentures 
see also description of amendments referred to above 
media funds its operations through internal cash flow and inter company debt 
media is not a ric and  therefore  is able to retain earnings to finance growth 
investment considerations interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates 
as short term interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate caps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
in addition  we rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such interest rate caps 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative 
our commercial loan activity has increased in recent years 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to achieve financing from traditional sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
our borrowers may default on their loans 
we primarily invest in and lend to companies that may have limited financial resources 
numerous factors may affect a borrower s ability to repay its loan  including o the failure to meet its business plan  o a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions  o the death  disability or resignation of one or more of the key members of management  or o the inability to obtain additional financing from traditional sources 
deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in the collateral for the loan 
expansion of our portfolio and increases in the proportion of our portfolio consisting of commercial loans could have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the portfolio 
because we must distribute our income  we have a continuing need for capital 
we have a continuing need for capital to finance our lending activities 
our current sources of liquidity are the following o bank credit facilities  o senior secured notes  o sales of participations in loans  o fixed rate  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  o a secured commercial paper program  and o loan amortization and prepayments 
as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
at december   we had fully drawn all capacity available under our million bank credit facilities at variable effective rates of interest averaging below the prime rate 
we minimize credit facility fees associated with the unused component of credit facilities by keeping the unused component as small as possible and periodically increasing the amounts available under the credit facilities only when necessary to fund portfolio growth 
in addition  we are eligible to seek sba funding 
in the event that we seek sba funding  no assurance can be given that the funding will be obtained 
we may have difficulty raising capital to finance our planned level of lending operations 
we may have difficulty raising the capital necessary to finance our planned level of lending operations 
during december  our outstanding commercial paper began to mature and was replaced by draws on the notes payable to our bank facility 
the commercial paper was not renewed as a result of the loss of a credit rating due to the merger of our rating agencies and due to the remaining rating agency lowering our rating 
in addition  we are currently unable to expand our borrowing lines until new banks join the lending syndicate or a debt offering is completed 
the lead bank in our lending syndicate has recently approximately doubled its exposure to medallion and mfc to million as a result of a merger between the lead bank and another member of the lending syndicate 
in september  this bank asked us to find an additional participant to reduce its exposure 
we are actively seeking new members for the lending syndicate 
if we are unable to continue to diversify geographically  our business may be adversely affected if the new york taxicab industry experiences an economic downturn 
although we are diversifying from the new york city area  a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from new york city taxicabs and medallion loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
an economic downturn in the new york city taxicab industry could lead to an increase in defaults on our medallion loans and may also adversely affect the operation of our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
in addition  an economic downturn could impact the value of our medallion collateral 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our operations geographically 
if there is an economic downturn  our commercial loan customers may experience difficulty in servicing their debt with us and the level of our delinquencies and loan losses may increase 
an economic downturn could result in certain of our commercial loan customers experiencing declines in business activities  which could lead to difficulties in their servicing of their loans with us 
if this were to happen  the level of delinquencies  defaults  and loan losses in commercial loan portfolio could increase 
the loss of certain key members of our senior management could adversely affect us 
our success is largely dependent upon the efforts of senior management 
the death  incapacity or loss of the services of certain of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial results 
there can be no assurance that other qualified officers could be hired 
acquisitions may lead to difficulties that could adversely affect our operations 
by their nature  corporate acquisitions entail certain risks  including those relating to undisclosed liabilities  the entry into new markets and personnel matters 
difficulties could also arise integrating the acquired operations or managing problems due to sudden increases in the size of our loan portfolio 
in such instances  we might be required to modify our operating systems and procedures  hire additional staff  obtain and integrate new equipment and complete other tasks appropriate for the assimilation of new and increased business activities 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful  if and when necessary  in minimizing these inherent risks or in establishing systems and procedures which will enable us to effectively achieve our desired results in respect of any of these or any future acquisitions 
competition from entities with greater resources and less regulatory restrictions may decrease our profitability 
we compete with banks  credit unions and other finance companies  some of which are small business investment companies  or sbics  in the origination of taxicab medallion loans and commercial loans 
we also compete with finance subsidiaries of equipment manufacturers 
many of these competitors have greater resources than medallion and certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than medallion 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify and complete financing transactions that will permit us to continue to compete successfully 
our taxicab rooftop advertising business competes with other taxicab rooftop advertisers as well as with all segments of the out of home advertising industry 
we also compete with other types of advertising media  including cable and network television  radio  newspapers  magazines and direct mail marketing 
certain of these competitors have also entered into the rooftop advertising business 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources than medallion and offer several forms of advertising as well as production facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete with these businesses successfully 
the valuation of our loan portfolio is subjective and we may not be able to recover our estimated value in the event of a foreclosure 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  we adjust quarterly the valuation of our portfolio to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of our management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our portfolio  management and the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market rates of interest  management and the board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values which approximate the value that would have been established by market forces and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
considering these factors  we have determined that the fair value of our portfolio is below its cost basis 
at december   our net unrealized depreciation on investments was approximately million 
based upon current market conditions and current loan to value ratios  our board of directors believes that the net unrealized depreciation of investments is adequate to reflect the fair value of the portfolio 
changes in taxicab industry regulations that result in the issuance of additional medallions could lead to a decrease in the value of our medallion loan collateral 
every city in which we originate medallion loans  and most other major cities in the united states  limits the supply of taxicab medallions 
this regulation results in supply restrictions that support the value of medallions 
actions that loosen these restrictions and result in the issuance of additional medallions into a market could decrease the value of medallions in that market 
as a result  the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market could be adversely affected 
we are unable to forecast with any degree of certainty whether any potential increases in the supply of medallions will occur 
in new york city  chicago and boston  and in other markets where we originate medallion loans  taxicab fares are generally set by government agencies 
expenses associated with operating taxicabs are largely unregulated 
as a result  the ability of taxicab operators to recoup increases in expenses is limited in the short term 
escalating expenses can render taxicab operations less profitable  and could cause borrowers to default on loans from medallion  and could potentially adversely affect the value of medallion s collateral 
a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
according to new york city taxi and limousine commission data  over the past years new york city taxicab medallions have appreciated in value an average of each year 
however  for sustained periods during that time  taxicab medallions have declined in value 
over the past year  the value of new york city taxicab medallions has declined by approximately 
our failure to maintain our subchapter m status could lead to a substantial reduction in the amount of income distributed to our shareholders 
we  along with some of our subsidiaries  have qualified as regulated investment companies under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
thus  we will not be subject to federal income tax on investment company taxable income which includes  among other things  dividends and interest reduced by deductible expenses distributed to our shareholders 
if our subsidiaries or we were to fail to maintain subchapter m status for any reason  our respective incomes would become fully taxable and a substantial reduction in the amount of income available for distribution to us and to our shareholders would result 
to qualify under subchapter m  we must meet certain income  distribution and diversification requirements 
however  because we use leverage  we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements set forth in the act 
these asset coverage requirements could  under certain circumstances  prohibit us from making distributions that are necessary to maintain our subchapter m status or require that we reduce our leverage 
in addition  the asset coverage and distribution requirements impose significant cash flow management restrictions on us and limit our ability to retain earnings to cover periods of loss  provide for future growth and pay for extraordinary items 
qualification as a regulated investment company under subchapter m is made on an annual basis and  although we and some of our subsidiaries are qualified as regulated investment companies  no assurance can be given that we will each continue to qualify for such treatment 
our sbic subsidiaries may be unable to meet the investment company requirements  which could result in the imposition of an entity level tax 
the small business investment act of regulates some of our subsidiaries 
the small business investment act restricts distributions by an sbic 
our sbic subsidiaries that are also regulated investment companies could be prohibited by sba regulations from making the distributions necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company 
each year  in order to comply with the sba regulations and the regulated investment company distribution requirements  we must request and receive a waiver of the sba s restrictions 
while the current policy of the sba s office of sbic operations is to grant such waivers if the sbic makes certain offsetting adjustments to its paid in capital and surplus accounts  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the sba s policy or that our subsidiaries will have adequate capital to make the required adjustments 
if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver  compliance with the sba regulations may result in loss of regulated investment company status and a consequent imposition of an entity level tax 
the internal revenue code s diversification requirements may limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business and our medallion collateral appreciation participation loan business 
we intend to continue to pursue an expansion strategy in our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
we believe that there are growth opportunities in this market 
however  the asset diversification requirements under the internal revenue code could restrict such expansion 
these requirements provide that  as a ric  not more than of the value of our total assets may be invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other regulated investment companies of any one issuer 
while our investments in our regulated investment company subsidiaries are not subject to this diversification test so long as these subsidiaries are regulated investment companies  our investment in media is subject to this test 
at the time of the commencement of our operations in may  media represented less than of our assets and the diversification test was satisfied 
presently  media represents approximately of our assets 
the subsequent growth in the value of media by itself will not re trigger the test even if media represents in excess of of our assets 
however  under the internal revenue code  the test must be reapplied in the event that we make a subsequent investment in media  lend to it or acquire another taxicab rooftop advertising business 
if we were to fail a subsequent test  we would lose our regulated investment company status 
as a result  our maintenance of regulated investment company status could limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
it will be our policy to expand our advertising business through internally generated growth 
we will only consider an acquisition in this area if we will be able to meet the internal revenue code s diversification requirements 
the fair value of the collateral appreciation participation loan portfolio at december  was million  which represented of the total loan portfolio 
we will continue to monitor the levels of these asset types in conjunction with the diversification tests 
we depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
we are a holding company and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
as a result  we rely heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness  but there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments 
we operate in a highly regulated environment 
we are regulated by the securities exchange commission and the sba 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations that govern business development companies  ric s or sbic s may significantly affect our business 
laws and regulations may be changed from time to time  and the interpretations of the relevant laws and regulations also are subject to change 
any change in the laws or regulations that govern our business could have a material impact on our operations or us
