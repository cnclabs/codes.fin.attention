our primary uses of cash included million in capital expenditures  million for the canadian acquisition  million to purchase short term investments  million to repurchase common stock  and million to purchase an import services company  blue star imports 
the remainder of the cash flow provided by operating activities is being retained for new store growth  store remodels  system enhancements  and other capital expenditures 
we fund merchandise purchases through operating cash flow 
at february   the company had an unsecured demand lending arrangement the facility with a bank to provide a million line of credit at either the lender s prime lending rate at february  or a negotiated rate such as libor 
the facility has a limit of million that can be used for direct borrowing 
no borrowings were required against the line for the current or prior year 
at february   letters of credit in the amount of million were outstanding leaving a remaining available balance on the line of million 
the company entered into a million non revolving term facility the term facility and a million revolving operating facility the operating facility in november to finance the canadian acquisition 
the term facility matures in december and bears interest at the one month bankers acceptance rate at february  plus basis points 
the operating facility is due in november  has six additional one year extensions  and bears interest at either the lender s prime lending rate at february  or the bankers acceptance rate at february  plus basis points

additionally  in fiscal  we plan to make million in scheduled principal payments on the term facility 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures and debt repayments primarily through available cash 
these forward looking statements will be influenced by our financial position  consumer spending  availability of financing  and the number of acceptable mall leases that may become available 
our growth strategy includes the possibility of growth through acquisitions 
we periodically consider and evaluate acquisitions and opportunities to support future growth  and may undertake acquisitions in and beyond 
at this time  we have not committed to any material future acquisition 
in the event we do pursue material future acquisitions  such actions could require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in closing any potential acquisition transaction  or that any acquisition we undertake would increase our profitability 
income taxes we had deferred tax assets of million at february  which resulted primarily from financial and tax accounting differences 
we have had taxable income during each of the past three tax years and anticipate that future taxable income will be able to recover the full amount of the deferred tax assets 
a portion of the deferred tax assets has resulted from a capital loss 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient capital gain income to recognize the benefit recorded from the loss 
assuming a effective tax rate  we will need to recognize pretax net income of approximately million in future periods to recover existing deferred tax amounts 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that the relatively modest levels of inflation experienced in the united states in recent years have had a significant effect on our net sales or our profitability 
substantial increases in cost  however  could have a significant impact on our business and the industry in the future 
safe harbor statement  business risks  and seasonality this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of approximately stores in the united states and canada in fiscal  the selection of approximately stores in the united states and canada for remodeling  the plan to spend approximately million to complete construction on our second distribution facility  the plan to convert certain canadian store locations to american eagle outfitters and thriftys bluenotes stores  the sufficiency of existing cash and investment balances  cash flows and line of credit facilities to meet fiscal cash requirements  and the possibility of growth through acquisitions 
we caution that these statements are further qualified by factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including without limitation  the following our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner  decline in demand for our merchandise  the ability to obtain suitable sites for new stores at acceptable costs  the integration of new stores into existing operations  the acceptance of our ae brand in canada  customer acceptance of our new store design  our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses  the integration of our additional distribution facility into existing operations  the expansion of buying and inventory capabilities  the hiring and training of qualified personnel  the availability of capital  the effect of overall economic conditions and consumer spending patterns  the effect of changes in weather patterns  the change in currency and exchange rates  interest rates  duties  tariffs  or quotas  and the effect of competitive pressures from other retailers 
the impact of the aforementioned factors  some of which are beyond our control  may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results in these statements and other forward looking statements we may make from time to time 
historically  our operations have been seasonal  with a significant amount of net sales and net income occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season and  to a lesser extent  the third quarter  reflecting increased demand during the back to school selling season 
during fiscal  these periods accounted for approximately of our sales 
as a result of this seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  refurbishments and relocations  competitive factors  weather and general economic conditions
