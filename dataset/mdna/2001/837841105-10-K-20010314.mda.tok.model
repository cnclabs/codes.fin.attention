tax equivalent net interest income increased  to million in from million in  and increased million from million in a higher level of average earning assets in increased interest income  but this increase was nearly offset by an increase in interest expense due to higher deposit and borrowing costs 
the growth in average earning assets  which increased million  or  to billion in from billion in and billion in  resulted from an increase in both loans and investment securities 
average loans  net of unearned income  were billion in  billion in and billion in the increase in loans was primarily related to internal loan growth 
average investment securities  excluding the average net unrealized securities gains  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in average investment securities in was attributable to the match funding in december of approximately million in mortgage backed securities with approximately million in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
the net interest margin of in was lower than the margin of in and in the lower net interest margin in resulted largely from loan growth exceeding deposit growth creating the need for alternative funding sources

citrus bank s promotions generated approximately million in certificates of deposit with an average annualized percentage yield of 
the majority of these certificates of deposit will remain on the books throughout the first three quarters of and will continue to impact the net interest margin 
in addition  the deposits generated through bank caroline  an internet bank  continued to grow in to approximately million in total deposits as of december  from million as of december  deposit rates for bank caroline are generally higher than those offered by the company s other subsidiary banks to reflect the lower cost structure associated with operating on the internet  and thus  increased the overall cost of deposits 
although deposit costs rose more rapidly than earning asset yields  upward adjustments in the prime interest rate resulted in an increase in the yield on earning assets 
the prime interest rate increased basis points during the second half of and basis points during the first half of the yield on earning assets increased to in from in and in commercial variable rate loans  which constituted approximately of the commercial portfolio  immediately repriced upward with the increases in the prime interest rate

this increase included a provision of approximately million made during the second quarter of when the company s reserve analysis methodology was employed to determine reserve requirements for anchor financial s loan portfolio 
during  loans held for investment  net of unearned income grew million  and nonperforming loans increased by million 
in addition  net charge offs were million higher than the million charged off in net charge offs in of million included million related to a participation in a shared national credit to video update  inc the provision for loan losses is a function of loan growth  charge off levels  and portfolio quality trends 
continued loan growth is anticipated  particularly in northern and central florida  as well as in the coastal carolina markets 
loan portfolio quality trends are expected to remain stable 
however  the current economic outlook implies a less robust business climate that could alter these expectations 
consequently  while significant change is not anticipated  management continues to closely monitor economic trends and the potential impact thereof on the company s loan portfolio

loans are the largest category of earning assets and produce the highest yields 
the loan portfolio consists principally of commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  consumer loans including both direct and indirect loans and one to four family residential mortgage loans

effective with the system conversion in june  the company reclassified certain loans due to the enhanced capability of analyzing loans by purpose and by collateral 
accordingly  the december  composition presented below may not be comparable with the earlier periods presented 
for example  the construction category as of december  included commercial construction  which was previously included in commercial secured by real estate 
the company s increase in consumer loans during and was due primarily to the expansion of indirect lending to new markets in south carolina and florida

the interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity  and principal amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulations also influence interest rates 
allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance is analyzed on a quarterly basis 
for purposes of this analysis  adequacy is defined as a level sufficient to absorb probable losses in the portfolio 
the methodology employed for this analysis is as follows 
the portfolio is segregated into risk similar segments for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics 
loss ratios are calculated by product type for consumer loans and by risk grade for commercial loans 
large problem commercial loans are individually assessed and assigned specific loss estimates 
to allow for modeling error  a range of probable loss ratios is then derived for each segment at plus and minus five percent of the adjusted historical loss ratio 
the resulting percentages are then applied to the dollar amounts of loans in each segment to arrive at each segment s range of probable loss levels 
the allowance for each portfolio segment is set at an amount within its range that reflects management s best judgment of the extent to which historical loss levels are more or less accurate indicators of current losses in the portfolio 
management s judgments evolve from an assessment of various issues  including but not limited to the pace of loan growth  emerging portfolio concentrations  risk management system changes  entry into new markets  new product offerings  loan portfolio quality trends  and uncertainty in current economic and business conditions 
this methodology was first adopted for the march  analysis 
for each quarter of  an analysis was also conducted using the methodology employed in prior years 
comparison of the results from these parallel analyses confirms that this change in methodology did not alter management s conclusion as to the adequacy of the allowance in the current period or for prior periods 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of the company 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
in addition  such regulatory agencies could require the company to adjust its allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance totaled million  or of loans held for investment net of unearned income at december   compared with million  or  at december  a provision of approximately million was made during the second quarter of when the company s reserve analysis methodology was employed to determine reserve requirements for anchor financial s loan portfolio 
during the second quarter of  the allowance was reduced million as a consequence of the sale of the credit card portfolio 
the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was and as of december  and  respectively 
nonperforming loans increased to million as of december  from million at december  see credit quality

asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as the company s interest sensitivity gap at december  the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments  prepayment of principal and potential calls 
for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents principal cash flows based on management s judgement concerning their most likely runoff 
the actual maturities and runoff could vary substantially if future prepayments  runoff and calls differ from the company s historical experience and management s judgement 
interest sensitivity gap gap position measures the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities during a given time frame 
the company s gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is reviewed periodically to provide insights related to the static repricing structure of assets and liabilities 
at december   on a cumulative basis through twelve months  rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets  resulting in a liability sensitive position of million

the adjustment for repricing characteristics of variable rate loans adjusts the net contractual interest sensitive position for the immediate repricing of variable rate loans 
the contractual maturities are used for the net contractual interest sensitive position 
achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of the company s asset liability function 
the company attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to achieve consistent growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
the company seeks to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
the company s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to have a significant impact on net interest income over time 
the company s asset liability committee uses a simulation model to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the company s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated on a periodic basis in order to obtain the most accurate forecast possible 
the forecast presents information over a twelve month period 
it reports a base case in which interest rates remain flat and reports variations that occur when rates immediately increase and decrease basis points 
according to the model as of december   the company is positioned so that net interest income will increase million in the next twelve months if interest rates rise basis points and will decrease million in the next twelve months if interest rates decline basis points 
the larger increase in net interest income when interest rates are increased basis points is due to the assumptions made regarding deposit repricings based on the company s experience 
in an increasing rate environment  the company assumes that deposits will not increase the full basis points whereas in a declining rate environment  it is assumed that deposit rates will decline the entire basis points 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates and loan prepayments  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
liquidity liquidity management ensures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan and capital expenditure commitments  maintain reserve requirements  pay operating expenses  provide funds for dividends and debt service  and manage operations on an ongoing basis 
funds are primarily provided by the subsidiary banks through customers deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  loan sales or securitizations  securities available for sale  maturities of securities  temporary investments and earnings 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that the company is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
investment securities are an important tool to the company s liquidity management 
securities classified as available for sale may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs and or significant prepayment risk 
net cash provided by operations and deposits from customers have been the primary sources of liquidity for the company 
liquidity is also enhanced by the ability to acquire new deposits through the subsidiary s established branch network of more than branches in south carolina  north carolina  and florida 
in addition  the company can raise deposits on the internet through bank caroline 
the liquidity needs of the subsidiary banks are a factor in developing their deposit pricing structure  deposit pricing may be altered to retain or grow deposits if deemed necessary 
the subsidiary banks have access to borrowing from the fhlb and maintain short term lines of credit from unrelated banks 
at december   unused borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaled approximately million with an outstanding balance of million 
effective january   the unused borrowing capacity from the fhlb could increase due to the ability to borrow against certain commercial real estate loans 
at december   the subsidiary banks had unused short term lines of credit totaling approximately million which are withdrawable at the lender s option 
management believes that these sources are adequate to meet its liquidity needs 
liquidity at the parent company level is provided through cash dividends from the subsidiary banks and the capacity of the parent company to raise additional borrowed funds as needed 
if the company elects to repurchase shares through its share repurchase program  such purchases will reduce liquidity at the parent company level 
credit quality a willingness to take credit risk is inherent in the decision to grant credit 
prudent risk taking requires a credit risk management system based on sound policies and control processes that ensure compliance with those policies 
the company s credit risk management system is defined by policies approved by the board of directors that govern the risk underwriting  portfolio monitoring  and problem loan administration processes 
adherence to underwriting standards is managed through a multi layered credit approval process and immediate after the fact review by credit risk management of loans approved by lenders 
compliance with loan monitoring policies is managed through daily review by credit risk managers  monthly reviews of exception reports  and ongoing analysis of asset quality trends 
the administration of problem loans is driven by policies that require written plans for resolution and quarterly meetings with credit risk management to review progress 
credit risk management activities  including specific reviews of new large credits  are reviewed by the directors credit committees of each banking subsidiary  which meet monthly 
beginning in the first quarter of  a new credit audit function was launched to provide management and the board of directors a more comprehensive independent review of compliance with credit policy  both at the city office level and at the credit risk management level 
the results of these credit audits  which focus on testing for compliance with credit policies and procedures  are reported to the directors credit committees of the banking subsidiaries 
nonperforming assets grew from million  or of loans and other real estate owned  as of december  to million  or of loans and other real estate owned  as of december  the increase in nonperforming assets was attributable to the economic climate  which ultimately governs how loans perform 
the general economic climate clearly softened in while management does not anticipate significant increases in this ratio  nonperforming asset levels inevitably rise as business conditions decline 
however  management is confident that the company s risk management system ensures prompt identification of problem loans  timely recognition of losses and the maintenance of adequate loss reserves 
as discussed under balance sheet review equity investments  the company makes loans to emerging companies that have a bank related technology or service the company or its subsidiaries can use 
these loans represent a higher credit risk to the company due to the start up nature of these companies 
despite higher nonperforming asset levels in  charge offs were of average loans  unchanged from in and lower than in during  net charge offs of million included million related to a participation in a shared national credit to video update  inc video update 
the decline in the charge off ratios from was partially attributable to the april sale of the credit card portfolio 
uncertainty in the economic outlook has increased  making charge off levels in future periods less predictable 
however  loss exposure in the portfolio is identified  reserved  and closely monitored to ensure that changes are promptly addressed in the analysis of reserve adequacy
