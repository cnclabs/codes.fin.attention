the managed it services segment provides network and systems design  integration  and management of large scale environments linking multiple technologies  operating systems  protocols and geographic areas 
oaot manages enterprise systems and provides desktop management services  which include on site and remote network systems management 
these services are provided  generally under long term fixed price contracts  as either part of an it outsourcing team with its strategic customers to a wide range of end users or directly to middle market customers 
the company s strategic partners and customers include ibm and compaq 
in the company s data center management contract was renewed for ten years 
management believes that revenues from this contract may increase over the term of the contract  however  there is no assurance that revenues from this contract will increase or continue at historic revenue and profitability levels 
the professional services segment provides information technology personnel  primarily on a time and materials basis  that are regularly utilized within engagements to meet short or indefinite term requirements 
there are also instances where an engagement has started on a time and materials basis and evolved to a fixed price basis  as the requirements became sufficiently defined 
the professional services business is concentrated within one strategic customer  however  the company has expanded its customer base in and continues to focus on expanding its customer base in the future 
the company has experienced substantial growth since its inception  with revenues increasing to million in  from million in revenues from two strategic customers were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the largest strategic customer accounted for and  and the second largest strategic customer accounted for and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively

for the year ended december   oaot earned of its revenues from data center management services provided to strategic customers 
for the year ended december   the company earned of its revenues from data center management 
a decrease in the revenues or loss of a strategic customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the early termination or non renewal of a strategic customer s contract by an end user customer could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial conditions 
the company focuses its efforts on middle market commercial customers  as well as public sector customers 
in support of these efforts  the company has established strategic relationships with third party software vendors such as plumtree  siebel systems  great plains  mi  sap  and microsoft 
as part of these strategic relationships the company signed a special value added industry remarketer vair agreement with siebel systems  inc this agreement permits oaot to design  install  resell and host  on an a msp basis  siebel solutions for commercial and public sector customers in north america and europe 
the company has also hired teams of experienced sales professionals dedicated solely to selling comprehensive crm solutions 
although revenues resulting from these relationships were relatively small in  management expects revenues from these relationships to be significant in the future 
management recognizes the need to aggressively diversify and expand the company s services and customer base 
for the years ended december  and  approximately  and of the company s revenues  respectively  were derived from fixed price contracts 
certain of the company s fixed price contracts require the company to meet pre established levels of service  while achieving operating or managerial efficiencies during the course of the engagements 
profitability is generally lower during the early term of the engagements as the company invests in assuring a smooth start up and in attaining certain service levels prior to the implementation of productivity improvements 
upon completion of the initial performance phase  the company initiates activities to increase profitability through improved management practices and the establishment of new technical and operational methodologies 
engagements which involve new services to existing customers or services to new customers may also result in lower margins during the early term of the engagement 
the company has historically experienced margin improvements after the start up phase of its engagements 
in addition  operating results can be affected by the level of the company s investments in international and other business development activities 
the company believes that its business is not seasonal 
the company sells technology services and solutions predominantly to technology companies 
a significant portion of annual revenues  in and in  is recurring revenue under long term contracts and other annually renewable contracts that have historically been renewed year to year at relatively constant levels of revenue 
the company begins with backlog under long term contracts of approximately million 
backlog is expected to be realized over the next ten years 
however  the company s long term contracts generally have early termination provisions  which if invoked by its customers  could significantly impact the company s backlog 
further  the company s business is subject to general economic conditions and economic conditions within the technology industry  which appear to have been softening  especially with the decline of dot 
com businesses 
as the company expands its new business sector  it may become more susceptible to the overall economic conditions within the technology industry 
while the it services industry has generally experienced labor shortages and wage inflation in excess of many other industries  the company s engagements have not been materially affected 
the company prices its services under these engagements on the basis of the historical cost of the outsourced function  managerial experience  and its assessment of evolving technical factors 
the company also enters into professional services engagements requiring high demand it specialists for terms ranging up to months  usually on a time and materials basis 
the company is subject to the same general labor pressures inherent in the it services industry when performing these engagements and as it expands its services into the new business sector 
the company is dependent upon its ability to attract  hire and retain personnel who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to meet the service requirements of its clients 
in pricing its services under shorter term engagements  the company evaluates the existing labor market for it specialists and the expected duration of the engagement
