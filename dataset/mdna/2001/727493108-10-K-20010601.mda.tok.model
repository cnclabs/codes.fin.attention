item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information appearing under the caption management s discussion and analysis appearing at pages through of our annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by this reference 
risk factors affecting future operating results investors or potential investors in our stock should carefully consider the risks described below 
the performance of our stock will reflect the performance of our business relative to  among other things  our competition  general economic and market conditions and industry conditions 
you should carefully consider the following factors in connection with any investment in our stock 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of the risks occur 
if the risks occur  the trading price of plantronics stock could decline and an investor could lose all or part of his or her investment 
a general economic slowdown could result in reduction in overall demand for our products which would materially adversely affect our results and we believe this is currently taking place 
while our markets have not exhibited highly cyclical behavior in the past  our sales are affected by overall economic activity 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we saw a drop in the overall level of demand for our products which we attribute principally to a slowing in national and international economic growth 
we believe there has been a continued decline in the economy and that a recession may yet occur 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have seen a further reduction in the overall level of demand for our products 
if these trends are worse or longer than presently anticipated  this could cause us not to achieve the levels of sales required to achieve our anticipated financial results  which could in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our stock 
also  if the overall economy slows or there is a recession  this could affect the financial health of certain purchasers of our products  potentially resulting in the failure of such purchasers to pay amounts due to us 
a substantial portion of our sales come from the call center market and a decrease of demand in that market could materially adversely affect our results 
we have historically derived  and continue to derive  a substantial portion of our net sales from the call center market 
this market has grown significantly in recent years as new call centers have proliferated and existing call centers have expanded 
we also may have benefited from a short term bubble in call center demand in the first half of fiscal due to post year activities and due to a possibly aberrational growth of internet related businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the portion of fiscal that has passed before the filing of this report  our sales in the call center market have been below the level of sales in that market in recent prior periods 
we do not believe that our decreasing sales are a result of market share gains by our competitors but  instead  believe that the sales slowdown is due to reduction in the level of overall market demand 
while we believe that the call center market will grow in future periods  this growth could slow or revenues from this market could continue to decline due to various factors 
for example  technological advances such as automated interactive voice response systems could reduce or eliminate the need for call center agents in certain applications 
in addition  consumer resistance to telemarketing could materially adversely affect growth in the call center market 
a continued deterioration in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in the establishment of new call centers and in capital investments to expand or upgrade existing centers  and we believe this is in fact negatively affecting our business 
due to our reliance on the call center market  we will be affected more by changes in the rate of call center establishment and expansion and the communications products that call center agents use than would a company serving a broader market 
any decrease in the demand for call centers and related headset products could cause a decrease in the demand for our products  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are counting on the office  mobile  computer and residential markets to develop and we could be materially adversely affected if they do not develop as we expect 
while the call center market is still a substantial portion of our business  we believe that our future prospects will depend in large part on the growth in demand for headsets in the office  mobile  computer and residential markets 
these communications headset markets are relatively new and undeveloped 
moreover  we do not have extensive experience in selling headset products to customers in these markets 
if the demand for headsets in these markets fails to develop  or develops more slowly than we currently anticipate  or if we are unable to effectively market our products to customers in these markets  it would have a material adverse effect on the potential demand for our products and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these headset markets are also subject to general economic conditions and if there is a continued slowing of national or international economic growth or a recession  these markets may not materialize to the levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results  which could in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a number of causes outside our control 
our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future for a variety of reasons  including the following general economic conditions  changes in demand for our products  insolvency of purchasers of our products or failure of purchasers of our products to pay amounts due to us  timing and size of orders from customers  price erosion  cancellations or delays of deliveries of components and subassemblies by our suppliers  variances in the timing and amount of engineering and operating expenses  distribution channel mix variations  changes in the levels of cooperative advertising or market development funding required by retail resellers of our products  delays in shipments of our products  material product returns and customer credits  new product introductions by us or our competitors  entrance of new competitors  changes in actual or target inventory levels of our channel partners  increases in the costs of our components and subassemblies  changes in the mix of products sold by us  and seasonal fluctuations in demand 
each of the above factors is difficult to forecast and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we generally ship most orders during the quarter in which they are received  and  consequently  we do not have a significant backlog of orders 
as a result  quarterly net sales and operating results depend primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter 
it is difficult to forecast orders for a given quarter 
since a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and certain manufacturing expenses  are fixed and difficult to reduce or modify  if net sales do not meet our expectations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results can also vary substantially in any period depending on the mix of products sold and the distribution channels through which they are sold 
in the event that sales of lower margin products or sales through lower margin distribution channels in any period represent a disproportionate share of total sales during such period  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future operating results 
in addition  our operating results in a future quarter or quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  and  as a result  the price of our common stock might fall 
if we do not match production to demand we will be at risk of losing business or our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
we saw good increases in customer demand for our products through most of fiscal historically  we have generally been able to increase production to meet increasing demand 
however  the demand for our products is dependent on many factors and such demand is inherently difficult to forecast 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following operating problems  among others if forecasted demand does not develop  we could have excess production or excess capacity 
excess production could result in higher inventories of finished products  components and subassemblies 
if we were unable to sell these inventories  we would have to write off some or all of our inventories of obsolete products and unusable components and subassemblies 
excess manufacturing capacity could lead to higher production costs and lower margins 
significant reduction in production levels to address current decreases in demand may leave us unprepared to meet a rapid increase in demand for our products 
if demand increases beyond that forecasted  we would have to rapidly increase production 
we depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and subassemblies  and  therefore  might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand 
this could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations 
there could be short term losses of sales while we are trying to increase production 
if customers turn to competitive sources of supply to meet their needs  there could be a long term impact on our revenues 
rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for components and subassemblies  increased expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of required materials  and higher overtime costs and other expenses 
these higher expenditures could lower our profit margins 
further  if production is increased rapidly  there may be decreased manufacturing yields  which may also lower our margins 
any of the foregoing problems could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our suppliers and failure of our suppliers to provide quality components or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our results 
we buy components and subassemblies from a variety of suppliers and assemble them into finished products 
we also have certain of our products manufactured for us by third party suppliers 
the cost  quality  and availability of such goods are essential to the successful production and sale of our products 
obtaining components  subassemblies and finished products entails various risks  including the following we obtain certain subassemblies  components and products from single suppliers  and alternate sources for these items are not readily available 
to date  we have experienced only minor interruptions in the supply of these subassemblies  components and products  none of which has significantly affected our results of operations 
current adverse economic conditions could lead to a higher risk of failure of our suppliers to remain in business or to be able to purchase the subcomponents and parts required by them to produce and provide to us the parts we need 
an interruption in supply from any of our single source suppliers in the future would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
prices of components and subassemblies may rise 
if this occurs and we are not able to pass these increases on to our customers or to achieve operating efficiencies that would offset the increases  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the lead times required in order to obtain certain subassemblies  components and products from certain foreign suppliers  we may not be able to react quickly to changes in demand  potentially resulting in either excess inventories of such goods or shortages of the subassemblies  components and products 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we experienced a substantial rise in finished goods inventories in part resulting from purchases of finished products from our suppliers in excess of forecasted demand 
those inventory levels remained high through the fourth quarter of fiscal failure in the future to match the timing of purchases of subassemblies  components and products to demand would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to provide us with components and subassemblies 
rather  we buy most components and subassemblies on a purchase order basis 
if our suppliers experience increased demand or shortages  it could affect deliveries to us 
in turn  this would affect our ability to manufacture and sell products that are dependent on those components and subassemblies 
this would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we sell our products through various channels of distribution and a failure of those channels to operate as we expect could decrease our revenues 
we sell substantially all of our products through distributors  retailers  oems and telephony service providers 
our existing relationships with these parties are nonexclusive and can be terminated by either party without cause 
our channel partners also sell or can potentially sell products offered by our competitors 
to the extent that our competitors offer our channel partners more favorable terms  such partners may decline to carry  de emphasize or discontinue carrying our products 
in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified channel partners 
further  such partners may not recommend  or continue to recommend  our products 
in the future  our oem customers or potential oem customers may elect to manufacture their own products  similar to those we currently sell to them 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors  oems  retailers and telephony service providers or to expand our distribution channels could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our distribution channels generally hold inventories of our products  determined in their own business judgment to be sufficient to meet their customer s delivery requirements 
such inventory levels are subject to market conditions  business judgment by the reseller and our ability to meet their time to ship needs 
rapid reductions by our distributors  oems  retailers and other customers in the levels of inventories held in our products could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we generally offer our customers certain credit terms  allowing them to pay for products purchased from us between thirty and sixty days or more after we ship the products 
our receipt of payment for our products depends on the financial liquidity of those customers 
if significant customers or a significant number of customers experience liquidity problems  this could affect our ability to collect our accounts receivables  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have strong competitors and will likely face additional competition in the future 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of companies in the various markets for communications headsets 
our single largest competitor is gn netcom  a subsidiary of gn great nordic ltd  a danish telecommunications conglomerate 
gn great nordic reported revenues of billion danish krone approximately million in calendar in calendar year  gn netcom continued its practice of acquiring other companies in the headset business 
in  gn netcom acquired jabra corporation  a supplier of headsets in the mobile phone market  resulting in an entity with a broader mobile product offering and greater marketing presence than either of the two entities had separately 
on october   gn netcom announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire hello direct  inc  a retail channel seller of communications products and our former customer 
on october   we announced that we terminated our contract for the supply of products to hello direct due to the impending acquisition of hello direct  inc by gn netcom 
it is not clear how this acquisition will affect us other than the termination of the product purchase contract  which we do not believe will have a material adverse effect 
however  the acquisition by gn netcom of hello direct does give it a directly owned retail channel presence it did not have before the acquisition 
we currently operate principally in a multilevel distribution model we sell most of our products to distributors who  in turn  resell to dealers or end customers 
gn netcom s acquisition of hello direct and its recent acquisition of one or more european distributors indicates it may be moving to a direct sales model 
while we believe that our business and our customers benefit from our current distribution structure  if gn netcom or other competitors sell directly  they may offer lower prices which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
on february   logitech international sa  a manufacturer and seller of computer accessory products  announced that it had agreed to purchase labtec inc  a vancouver  washington based provider of  among other products  headsets for use with computers 
the acquisition was completed in march due to this acquisition  labtec will have greater resources with which to compete with us than it did prior to its acquisition 
we anticipate that we will face additional competition from companies that currently do not offer communications headsets 
this is particularly true in the office  mobile  computer and residential markets 
as these markets mature  we will face increased competition from consumer electronics companies and other companies that currently manufacture and sell mobile phones or computer peripheral equipment 
these new competitors are likely to be larger  offer broader product lines  bundle or integrate with other products communications headset tops and bases manufactured by them or others  offer products containing bases that are incompatible with our headset tops and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we anticipate that we will also face additional competition from companies  principally located in the far east  which offer very low cost headset products  including products which are modeled on or direct copies of our products 
these new competitors are likely to offer very low cost products which may result in price pressure in the market 
if market prices are substantially reduced by such new entrants into the headset market  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
historically  our expertise in acoustics and design has allowed us to design  develop and manufacture products with the levels of sound quality enabling us to meet the needs of our customers 
due to technological advances  including but not limited to better digital signal processing  our current and future competitors may be able to develop products with the same or better audio quality at lower costs 
these technological advances may allow current and future competitors to compete more effectively in terms of product quality or price that could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we believe that important competitive factors for us are product reliability  product features  customer service and support  reputation  distribution  ability to meet delivery schedules  warranty terms  product life and price 
if we do not compete successfully with respect to any of these or other factors it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  if we do not successfully develop and market products that compete successfully with those of our competitors  it would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new product development is risky and we will be materially adversely affected if we do not respond to changing customer requirements and new technologies 
our product development efforts historically have been directed toward enhancement of existing products and development of new products that capitalize on our core capabilities 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including the proper selection of new product features  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  cost effective manufacture of such products  quality of new products and market acceptance 
to be successful in the future  we must develop new products  qualify these new products  successfully introduce these products to the market on a timely basis  and commence and sustain low cost  volume production to meet customers demands 
although we attempt to determine the specific needs of headset users in our target markets  because almost all of our sales are indirect  we may not always be able to timely and accurately predict end user requirements 
as a result  our products may not be timely developed  designed to address current or future end user requirements  offered at competitive prices or accepted  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we generally incur substantial research and development costs before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product can be ascertained 
accordingly  revenues from new products may not be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
historically  the technology used in lightweight communications headsets has evolved slowly 
new products have primarily offered stylistic changes and quality improvements  rather than significant new technologies 
we anticipate that the technology used in hands free communications devices  including our products  will begin to evolve more rapidly in the future 
we believe that this is particularly true of the office  mobile and residential markets  which may require us to develop new headset technologies to support cordless and wireless operation and to interface with new communications and computing devices 
as a result  our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing market requirements  and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments 
if we are unable to develop and introduce enhanced products or new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  it will materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the historically slow evolvement of our products  we have generally been able to phase out obsolete products without significant impact to our operating margins 
however  as we develop new generations of products more quickly  we expect that the pace of product obsolescence will increase concurrently 
the disposition of inventories of obsolete products may result in reductions to our operating margins and materially adversely affect our earnings and results of operations 
changes in regulatory requirements may adversely impact our gross margins as we comply with such changes or reduce our ability to generate revenues if we are unable to comply 
our products must meet the requirements set by regulatory authorities in the numerous jurisdictions in which we sell them 
as regulations and local laws change  we must modify our products to address those changes 
regulatory restrictions may increase the costs to design and manufacture our products  resulting in a decrease in demand for our products if the costs are passed along or a decrease in our margins 
compliance with regulatory restrictions may impact the technical quality and capabilities of our products  reducing their marketability 
we are currently facing a substantial change in the regulations applicable to our products in the european union and there is no certainty that we can meet those regulatory requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
failure to conform our products to these new european regulatory requirements would result in our inability to sell such products in europe  resulting in a material adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant foreign operations and there are inherent risks in operating abroad 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were derived from customers outside the united states 
approximately of our net sales in fiscal were derived from customers outside the united states  compared with approximately of our net sales in fiscal in addition  we conduct substantially all of our headset assembly operations in our manufacturing facility located in mexico  and we obtain most of the components and subassemblies used in our products from various foreign suppliers 
the inherent risks of international operations  particularly in mexico  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include cultural differences in the conduct of business  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  economic and political conditions in each country  management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in fiscal  the value of major european currencies dropped against the us dollar 
to date  we have partially but not fully reflected that change in currency value in our selling prices 
in order to maintain a competitive price for our products in europe  we may have to effectively reduce our current prices further  resulting in a lower margin on products sold in europe 
continued change in the values of european currencies or changes in the values of other foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our foreign operations put us at risk of loss if there are material changes in currency values as compared to the us dollar 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates create risk to us in both the sale of our products and our purchase of supplies 
fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
in fiscal  the value of major european currencies dropped against the us dollar  resulting in currency transaction losses 
although we did not engage in any hedging activities in fiscal to mitigate exchange rate risks  in fiscal we have introduced programs designed to reduce our foreign currency net asset exposure and thus have a goal to reduce transaction gains and losses that are accounted for in other income expense 
substantially all of our revenues throughout europe are priced and thus denominated in local currencies 
thus  our economic exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has not changed and revenues and margins can be adversely impacted by such fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
to the extent that sales to our foreign customers increase or transactions in foreign currencies increase  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
we may have experienced in calendar a non sustainable increase in sales as a result of pent up demand from yk concerns and the rapid growth of internet related businesses 
our results for the first half of calendar year may not be indicative of longer term market conditions 
our results of operations for that period  including the first three quarters of fiscal  may reflect a non sustainable increase in sales as a result of purchases by call center and office customers who delayed investment in new call centers or information technologies due to concerns over the effects of yk 
further  there may have been an unsustainable increase in calendar in the level of spending on information technology infrastructure  including telecommunications devices which use headsets  due to customers addressing the rapid growth of internet related businesses 
if there are problems that affect our principal manufacturing facility in mexico  we could face losses in revenues or material increases in costs of our operations 
the majority of our manufacturing operations are currently performed in a single facility in tijuana  mexico 
a fire  flood or earthquake  political unrest or other disaster or condition affecting our facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have developed a disaster recovery plan and believe we are adequately insured with respect to this facility  we may not be able to implement the plan effectively or on a timely basis or recover under applicable insurance policies 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our business operations and california s current energy crisis could disrupt or make substantially more expensive the operations at our headquarters facility 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt the conduct of sales  marketing  research and development  finance and other operations at our headquarters facilities 
in the event of an acute power shortage  california has  on some occasions  implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we have emergency back up generators which keep our business information systems in operation but we do not have sufficient back up generating capacity or alternate sources of power to keep our headquarters in full operation in the event of a blackout 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue full operations at our headquarters 
any such interruption could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
further  it is likely that the cost of electrical power at our california facilities is going to increase substantially 
we do not currently believe that the increased expense for electrical power will be a material impact on our financial condition but if prices increase beyond that currently expected  we could be materially adversely affected 
we have intellectual property rights that could be infringed by others and we are potentially at risk of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as patent  trademark  trade secret  and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we currently hold thirty six united states patents and additional foreign patents and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when we believe it to be appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive 
patents may not be issued in response to our applications  and patents that are issued may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged by others 
if we are required to enforce our patents or other proprietary rights through litigation  the costs and diversion of management s attention could be substantial 
in addition  the rights granted under any patents may not provide us competitive advantages or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
moreover  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property rights  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights against us 
such claims  if they are asserted  could result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention 
in addition  we may not ultimately prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from such third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to potential lawsuits alleging defects in our products 
the use of our products exposes us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims have in the past been  and are currently being  asserted against us 
none of the previously resolved claims have materially affected our business  financial condition or results of operations  nor do we believe that any of the pending claims will have such an effect 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our mobile headsets are used with mobile telephones 
there has been continuing public controversy over whether the radio frequency emissions from mobile telephones are harmful to users of mobile phones 
we believe that there is no conclusive proof of any health hazard from the use of mobile telephones but that research in this area is incomplete 
we have tested our headsets through independent laboratories and have found that use of our headsets reduces radio frequency emissions at the user s head to virtually zero 
however  if research was to establish a health hazard from the use of mobile telephones or public controversy grows even in the absence of conclusive research findings  there could be an adverse impact on the demand for our mobile headsets 
there is also continuing and increasing public controversy over the use of mobile telephones by operators of motor vehicles 
while we believe that our products enhance driver safety by permitting a motor vehicle operator to generally be able to keep both hands free to operate the vehicle  there is no certainty that this is the case and we may be subject to claims arising from allegations that use of a mobile telephone and headset contributed to a motor vehicle accident 
we maintain product liability insurance and general liability insurance that we believe would cover any such claims 
however  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we believe we comply with environmental laws and regulations  we are still exposed to potential risks from environmental matters 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process 
although we believe that our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or operations 
we have included in our financial statements a reserve of million for possible environmental remediation of the site of one of our previous businesses 
while no claims have been asserted against us in connection with this matter  such claims could be asserted in the future and any liability that might result could exceed the amount of the reserve 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose the benefit of the services of ken kannappan or other key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the services of a limited number of executive officers and other key employees 
the unanticipated loss of the services of our president and chief executive officer  mr 
kannappan  or one or more of our other executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our stock price may be volatile and your investment in plantronics stock could be lost 
the market price for our common stock may continue to be affected by a number of factors  including the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  the loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in our published forecasts of future results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market  general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
stock prices for many companies  particularly in the technology sector  have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performances of such companies 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our current by laws or which could be put into place by our board of directors could affect market prices of our stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
further  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
citicorp venture capital has significant control over our business 
our largest stockholder  citicorp venture capital  ltd 
cvc  beneficially owns  shares of our common stock excluding any shares that may be owned by employees of cvc or its affiliates  which represents approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  we also have an agreement with cvc under which it is entitled to have up to three of its designees serve on our board of directors  depending on the level of cvc s continuing stock ownership 
based on its current ownership of our outstanding common stock  cvc is entitled to designate two nominees 
messrs 
m 
saleem muqaddam and john m 
o mara are currently serving as cvc s designees pursuant to that agreement having been nominated for election in a period in which the agreement with cvc required us to nominate and support the election of three designees of cvc 
in addition  our bylaws contain provisions that require a two thirds supermajority vote of the board of directors to approve certain transactions  including amendments of our certificate of incorporation  certain provisions of our bylaws  mergers and sales of substantial assets  acquisitions of other companies and sales of capital stock 
these provisions may have the effect of giving a small number of directors the ability to block such transactions 
we have several significant stockholders and  given the low trading volume of our stock  if they sell their shares in a short period of time  we could see an adverse effect on the market prices of our stock 
as of may   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and in the public market 
all of these shares are freely tradable except for approximately  shares held by affiliates of plantronics including cvc and the directors and officers of plantronics 
these approximately  shares may be sold in reliance on rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  or pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
some of our current stockholders  including cvc and certain of our directors  also have certain contractual rights to require plantronics to register their shares for public sale 
approximately  additional shares are subject to outstanding stock options as of may  as of may   ms 
louise cecil  the widow of our former ceo and chairman  robert s 
cecil  held options on approximately  shares of our common stock  transferred to her by mr 
cecil during his life 
she has registered those shares for resale and can sell any or all of those shares at any time 
plantronics stock is not heavily traded 
the average daily trading volume of our stock in fiscal year was approximately  shares per day with a median volume in that period of  shares per day 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by cvc or any of our officers  directors or other stockholders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors affecting future operating results beginning on page interest rate risk at march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to million at march  at march   we had marketable securities totaling million compared to million at march  cash equivalents have an original maturity of ninety days or less  marketable securities have an original maturity of greater than ninety days  but less than one year 
we believe we are not currently exposed to significant interest rate risk as the majority of our cash and marketable securities were invested in securities or interest bearing accounts with maturities of less than ninety days 
the average maturity period for our marketable securities at march  was ten months 
the interest rates locked in on those investments ranged from to 
our investment policy requires that we only invest in deposit accounts  certificates of deposit or commercial paper with minimum ratings of a p and money market mutual funds with minimum ratings of aaa 
in fiscal  we renewed our million revolving credit facility  including a million letter of credit subfacility with a major bank 
the revolving credit facility and letter of credit subfacility both expire in november as of march   we have no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
if we choose to borrow under this facility in the future  and market interest rates rise  then our interest payments would increase accordingly 
foreign currency exchange rate risk approximately of our revenue was realized outside of the united states  with approximately denominated in foreign currencies  predominately the great british pound and the euro 
during fiscal years and we did not engage in any hedging activities 
in fiscal  we implemented a hedging strategy to minimize the effect of these currency fluctuations 
specifically  we began to hedge our european transaction exposure  hedging both our great british pound and euro positions 
however  we have no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not materially adversely affect our business in the future
