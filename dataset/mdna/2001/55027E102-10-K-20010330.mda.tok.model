item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in item of this report and factors that may affect future results in this report 
overview for the years ended december   and  we had net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of current and new products  the timing of the introduction by our strategic partners of commercial products based on our technology  the timing of regulatory approvals  our ability to scale up manufacturing operations and avoid component shortages  the introduction of new products by our competitors  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts and the timing of significant orders 
our limited operating history makes accurate predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
our ability to achieve sustained profitability will depend upon our ability to continue to enter into strategic partnerships with companies that will develop and market products incorporating our technology and market and distribute our systems and consumables 
strategic partners will develop application specific bioassay kits for use on our systems that they will sell to their customers generating royalties for us 
strategic partners may also perform testing services for third parties using our technology that will also result in royalties for us 
some strategic partners will also buy our products and then resell those products to their customers 
through december   we have entered into strategic partnerships with companies 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
we expect that each system s sale will generate a recurring revenue stream from the sale of consumable products 
in addition  we expect to generate royalty revenue from some of our strategic partners as they sell products incorporating our technology or provide testing services to third parties using our technology 
in accordance with the terms of a federal grant which we have received  grant revenue is recorded as research expenses relating to the grant are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
cost of product revenue consists of direct and indirect manufacturing  quality control  training  customer service and warranty costs 
our operating expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing scale up and business development and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue to develop both new products and our bioinformatics group 
our bioinformatics group will be incurring research and development expenses  including expenses related to the acquisition of blood samples  development of the assays  development of the software that will capture the data and analyze the results and establishment of the laboratory 
our selling and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to commercialize our products  and general and administrative expenses will increase as we add personnel and expand our facilities 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of options or warrants and the fair market value of restricted stock grants 
for options granted to employees and directors  this difference is calculated as of the grant date and amortized ratably over the vesting period 
for options or warrants granted to consultants  the difference is recognized as of the vesting date with adjustments made to the recognized deferred compensation amount up and until that time based on the market value of our common stock 
as a result of stock options  warrants and restricted stock grants  we recorded million and million in deferred stock compensation expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
total unamortized deferred stock compensation as of december  was million 
total deferred revenue as of december  was million and consisted of i payments received for sales to customers with rights of return that had not yet expired and ii upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of instruments or to be applied towards future royalty payments 
upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase systems or apply such amounts against royalty payments

gross profit increased by to million in from million in gross margin gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to i a reduction in the average selling price of our systems  resulting from an increase in the number of sales to strategic partners which are made at discounted prices  ii an increase in cost of product revenue caused by higher material costs and iii the absence of grant revenue in the first six months of research and development expense

offsetting this increase was a decrease in sales of the luminex r o system of  in  which is consistent with the phase out of the luminex r o system and the introduction of the higher priced luminex system

gross profit increased to million in from  in gross margin decreased from in to in the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to higher revenue from initial sales of the luminex analyzer in  and the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the higher per unit cost of the luminex  relative to the luminex r o system 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in these expenses include salaries and related costs of research and development personnel as well as the costs of consultants and parts and supplies associated with research and development projects 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of  in salaries and related personnel costs from the addition of employees during the year as well as additional costs to complete the development of the luminex system 
also  included in were costs of  associated with a government grant 
the increase was also due to amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately  in the increase in amortization of deferred stock compensation was primarily attributable to the issuance of stock options to our consultants 
selling  general and administrative expense

these amounts are being amortized ratably over the vesting periods 
the increase in amortization of deferred stock and stock compensation expense was primarily attributable to the issuance of stock options to our consultants 
interest income 
interest income remained relatively unchanged between and income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and federal research tax credit carryforwards of  the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards begin to expire in  if not utilized 
utilization of the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards will be limited by the change of ownership provisions contained in section of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation will result in the expiration of no more than  of net operating losses before utilization 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for the periods indicated in thousands  except per share data 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue     gross profit  loss from operations     net loss     basic loss per share quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue  gross profit loss from operations     net loss     basic loss per share liquidity and capital resources at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and had working capital of million 
at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and us corporate debt securities 
cash used in operations was million in  compared with million in purchases of property and equipment in totaled million  compared with million in we expect to incur increasing research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  including expenses related to additions to personnel  increased production and commercialization efforts and increased expenditures for product development and for the development of our bioinformatics group 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  the availability of government research grants  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the status of competitive products 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements through at least december  we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
recent accounting pronouncements as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company s financial statements for the year ending december  management believes that this statement will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments held to maturity 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
all payments for our products are required to be made in us dollars  therefore  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
accordingly  our foreign currency market risk is limited
