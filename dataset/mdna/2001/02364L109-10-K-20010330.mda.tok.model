liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents remain basically unchanged from  at december  to  at december  as part of the cps acquisition  the company borrowed million under its then existing senior credit facility

on august   the company replaced its existing senior credit facility with a million senior credit facility syndicated to a group of four commercial banks referred to as the credit facility and discussed further in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the spp acquisition  the company borrowed million under the credit facility and expanded the credit facility by million through december  during the course of the year  however  the company repaid million of the net principal amounts borrowed  resulting in a net increase in long term debt of million

if the rate of inflation exceeds the levels projected  such excess will be absorbed by the company 
conversely  the company will benefit should the actual rate of inflation fall below the estimate used in the bidding and negotiation process

the company  therefore  hedged million of the million available under the credit facility by entering into four separate interest rate collar agreements with three of its syndicate banks for notional amounts ranging from million to million 
these collar agreements are cash flow hedges which establish floors and ceilings on the day libo rate which reduce the volatility of the company s interest rate 
for the year ended december   no settlements with any of the three syndicate banks were required as the day libo rate remained within the range of respective floors and ceilings 
during january  however  interest rates began a significant decline which will result in the day libo rate falling below the floors of certain of the collar agreements as of the second quarter of the company will have million of long term debt priced at a weighted average interest rate of through october   and million priced at thereafter and through march  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recorded a liability of  net of taxes  on its balance sheet as of january   representing the fair market value of the cash flow hedge derivative instruments as of such date 
the company expects this liability to fluctuate during but to have a similar fair market value as of december  the company will continue to assess the current interest rate market conditions and to implement additional hedging instruments as deemed appropriate
