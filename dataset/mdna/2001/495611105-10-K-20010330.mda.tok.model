item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk on july   the thai government announced that the thai baht would thereafter be converted to a managed float system for the relationship of the baht to other international currencies 
this change had an immediate impact on the company s operations and the results of its operations 
the company s subsidiaries conduct their business with selling and purchase prices based on thai baht  us dollars  and other currencies 
sales are made both in thai baht and other currencies  but eventually will be converted into thai baht 
accordingly  the company bears foreign currency transaction risks between the date of purchase of goods for resale and the ultimate payment of the goods in the appropriate negotiated currency 
king power duty free company  limited kpd incurred an economic and financial loss as a result of the devaluation and subsequent float of the thai baht on the settlement of accounts in currencies owed other than thai baht 
however  as the thai baht stabilized and kpd began to buy forward contracts in order to prevent any exchange risk from its foreign currencies financial obligations  the losses from this transaction have been significantly reduced 
king power tax free company  limited kpt has been selling goods at prices based upon the us dollar since its inception 
further  kpt deals in predominately thailand produced goods whereby all purchases are settled in thai baht 
therefore  the devaluation of the thai baht had minimal effect on the settlement of open trade payables of kpt 
accordingly  the devaluation had an opposite economic impact on the operations of kpt whereby the thai baht devaluation increased the overall profitability of this subsidiary 
the overall effect of the thai baht devaluation was an increase in the attractiveness of thailand as a tourist destination 
this increase in tourists had a direct impact on increasing the company s sales in the post devaluation time period
