in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
in general sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
it further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as fair value  cash flow or foreign currency hedges and establishes accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of derivative instruments 
if a derivative is deemed to be an effective hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against changes in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized on an after tax basis in accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity section of the balance sheet until such time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
derivatives that are not hedges  as well as the ineffective portion of hedges  must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
in connection with the company s risk management strategies  the company holds certain foreign exchange  commodity and interest rate instruments that have been deemed derivatives pursuant to the criteria established in sfas upon adoption the company will be required to adjust certain of these derivatives to fair value in the balance sheet and recognize the offsetting gains or losses as adjustments to earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  as appropriate 
sfas will become effective for the company beginning january  the company does not believe that the implementation of sfas will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position

segment results water and industrial process chemicals water and industrial process chemicals sales increased to and earnings from operations decreased to for the overall segment  selling volumes increased 
this includes a volume increase due to the acquisition of imc in september of and a volume decrease due to the divestiture of the paper chemicals business on november  the increase in selling volumes was partially offset by the adverse effects of exchange rate changes and lower selling prices  which reduced sales approximately and  respectively 
the lower earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher raw material costs of petroleum derivatives  such as propylene  net unfavorable exchange rate changes  particularly in europe  and lower selling prices which more than offset the benefits from higher selling volumes and lower operating costs 
performance products performance products sales increased to and earnings from operations increased to for the overall segment  selling volumes increased  which includes a volume increase due to the acquisition of the bip business in october of the higher selling volumes were partially offset by the adverse effects of exchange rate changes  which reduced sales by about and lower selling prices  which were down about 
the segment serves a broad range of end markets  and during the fourth quarter of  demand in these markets began to reflect the slowing in the us and asian economies 
the improved earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher selling volumes  increased manufacturing productivity and certain licensing fees  partially offset by higher raw material costs  lower selling prices and the net unfavorable exchange rate changes 
specialty materials specialty materials sales decreased to  while earnings from operations increased to selling volumes decreased primarily due to lower boeing commercial aircraft build rates and boeing s transition from carbon to glass fiber composites for certain aircraft interiors 
the divestiture of the engineered molding compounds product line and the adverse effects of exchange rate changes reduced sales another and  respectively 
selling prices were up about 
during the fourth quarter of  demand from the large commercial airliner market began to improve 
the growth in earnings from operations were primarily the result of lower raw material costs and the benefits of the company s manufacturing rationalization programs 
building block chemicals building block chemicals sales to external customers were  an increase of from the previous year  and earnings from operations were  an increase of from the prior year 
for the overall segment  selling prices increased and selling volumes decreased  excluding a volume decrease due to the divestiture of the methanol plant in december of last year 
the adverse effects of exchange rate changes reduced sales another 
sales were favorably impacted by a sharp increase in acrylonitrile and acrylamide selling prices  although higher propylene and natural gas costs more than offset the selling price increases 
earnings from operations were favorably impacted by two major factors 
first  improved plant operations led to significantly higher production volumes of acrylonitrile  thereby reducing manufacturing cost per unit 
this in turn improved the overall gross profit of the segment 
the second factor was reduced plant spending 
during december  the ammonia production facility was idled as high natural gas costs together with relatively low ammonia prices made it uneconomical to produce ammonia 
the facility was started up again during the first week of february as declining gas costs made it economical to produce ammonia versus purchasing it from third parties 
due to the volatility of us natural gas markets  the company is unable to predict with certainty whether the plant will remain operational throughout see building block chemicals other building block chemicals in item  business 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  net sales for were  compared with  for the decrease was due mainly to of lower sales in the specialty materials segment and of lower sales in the building block chemicals segment

in  other income  net  included gains of related to the sale of the bulk molding compounds product line  of other investment income and on certain investments in unaffiliated companies 
equity in earnings of associated companies  which represents the company s before tax share of its owned associates earnings  was down primarily due to lower sales and earnings by criterion catalyst 
industry over capacity and difficult economic conditions in the refining industry affected operations at criterion catalyst 
the result has been much lower selling prices and an adverse product mix for hydrotreating catalysts 
cyro industries earnings were also down as selling prices and margins for certain of its products remain low

segment results water and industrial process chemicals water and industrial process chemicals sales increased to  and earnings from operations increased to the sales increase was primarily in mining chemicals 
overall  selling volumes were up  of which approximately were from the acquisitions of imc and the nottingham company s industrial minerals product lines 
the increase in selling volumes was partially offset by lower selling prices  which were down about  and the adverse effect of exchange rate changes  which reduced sales another 
the improved earnings from operations were primarily the result of leverage from higher sales  lower raw material prices and reduced operating costs 
performance products performance products sales increased to  and earnings from operations increased to overall  selling volumes were up  of which approximately were from amino coatings resins sales generated as a result of the july acquisition of the dyno business and the october acquisition of the bip business 
the remaining increase in selling volumes was due mainly to stronger sales volumes in the polymer additives product line 
the increase in selling volumes was partially offset by lower selling prices  which were down about  and the adverse effect of exchange rate changes  which reduced sales another 
the improved earnings from operations were primarily the result of higher sales volumes and to a lesser extent lower raw material prices and reduced operating costs 
specialty materials specialty materials sales were  a decrease of from the previous year 
earnings from operations  however  improved to approximately of the sales decrease was due to the divestiture of the molding compounds and certain other product lines  partially offset by the acquisition of amt in the fourth quarter of which added approximately to sales 
excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures  selling volumes were down as a result of the decline in the commercial aircraft build rates and were partially offset by new product introductions  new applications and new qualifications for the company s products 
selling prices decreased  but the decrease was largely offset by lower raw material costs 
earnings from operations benefited from the rationalization of manufacturing facilities and the removal of structural costs consistent with reduced commercial aircraft build rates 
building block chemicals building block chemicals sales were  an decrease 
earnings from operations were  compared with in for the segment overall  selling prices  primarily for acrylonitrile  were down  and volumes and exchange rates were down another and  respectively 
selling prices for acrylonitrile  which were weak for the first six months of  began to improve during the second half of the year  driven mostly by unanticipated global acrylonitrile production outages and the growing demand from asian acrylic fiber markets 
however  costs for propylene  the key raw material for acrylonitrile  increased at a faster rate  and as a result  acrylonitrile margins remained low 
in addition  lower selling prices and volumes of acrylamide and melamine  downtime at the acrylonitrile plant and other operating difficulties negatively impacted earnings

the fair value of the interest swap agreements  which was approximately at december  and at december   is not recognized in the financial statements 
interest rate differentials paid or received under the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
for further discussion about the interest rate swap agreements and other financial instruments see note to the consolidated financial statements and further discussions in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
commencing in september  the company entered into a series of rate lock agreements to hedge against the risk of an increase in treasury rates related to the company s offering of in long term debt securities 
the company made payments aggregating approximately to settle the rate lock agreements of which was paid during the first half of and the remainder in  which is being amortized over the life of the notes  notes and mopprssm as an increase in interest expense of such notes 
the amount of unamortized rate lock agreements included in long term debt was at december   and at december  the impact of inflation on the company is considered insignificant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a risk have been significantly hedged to mitigate the effects of inflation 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and equity price changes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  the company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with company established policies 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  the company enters into financial instrument transactions primarily with major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit and performance related risks 
foreign exchange rate risk the risk of adverse exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of foreign currency exposure 
in addition  the company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge accounts receivable  accounts payable  and intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business 
the maturity dates of the foreign exchange contracts are less than six months and strongly correlate to the maturity date of the underlying transaction 
the foreign exchange gains or losses and the offsetting losses or gains of the hedged transaction are marked to market and reflected in net earnings 
at december   the company had net foreign exchange contracts to purchase an aggregate of of dutch guilders  german marks and british pounds and to sell an aggregate of of french francs and argentine pesos for us dollars 
the company also had net contracts to sell dutch guilders with a value equivalent to for british pounds  contracts to purchase dutch guilders with a value equivalent to for other currencies  contracts to purchase norwegian krone with a value equivalent to for other european currencies and contracts to sell euros with a value equivalent to for british pounds 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts  based on exchange rates at december   exceeded contract values by approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would be a decrease of approximately however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
commodity price risk the company selectively utilizes natural gas derivative contracts  including forward contracts  which are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity and other hedging arrangements predominantly cash settled swap transactions to manage its exposure to price risk associated with the production of ammonia and other building block chemical products 
the maturity of these contracts correlates highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and has the effect of securing predetermined prices that the company pays for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit the company s exposure to increases in commodity prices  they also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract with amounts paid or received on early termination deferred on the balance sheet until such time 
at december   there were no natural gas derivative contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk at december   the financial liabilities of the company consisted primarily of fixed rate long term debt  which had a carrying value of and a fair value of approximately additionally  the company was party to four interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of two of the swap agreements have virtually offsetting terms 
another swap agreement effectively converts of variable rate interest obligations to fixed rate obligations and has a maturity date of november  the fourth interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted of the company s fixed rate borrowings due on march   to a floating rate  was terminated during january assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value of variable rate debt but do impact the future earnings and cash flows 
the net notional value of interest rate swap agreements subject to interest rate risk at december   was assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables were to remain constant  the net increase in interest expense would be immaterial and the fair market value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease equity price risk in connection with the company s stock repurchase program  the company selectively utilizes freestanding put option contracts that are indexed to the company s stock 
in lieu of purchasing the shares from the put option holders  the company has the right to elect settlement by paying the holders of the put options the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or additional shares of the company s common stock ie  net cash or net share settlement 
the put option contracts are initially measured at fair value and reported in stockholders equity 
subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized in the financial statements 
at december   there were no put options outstanding 
other outlook it is expected that increasing raw material prices and slowing in parts of the us and asian economies will negatively impact some parts of the company s business in  particularly in the first quarter of as a result  the company s sales growth and earnings per share growth objectives are not expected to be achieved in the company has quantified its earnings expectations for the full year of to be in a range of to per diluted share 
in the water and industrial process chemicals segment  the company believes that its technology  acquisitions and sales volume increases provide the opportunities to meet its growth goals in in the performance products segment  the company believes that slowing economic growth will reduce sales to the plastics  automotive and industrial coatings markets 
moreover  the company believes margins in this segment will also be reduced by the escalation of costs of natural gas and methanol derivatives  key intermediates that are used in the manufacture of many of the company s specialty resins products 
the company believes that these external factors will make it difficult to achieve its profit growth goals 
in the specialty materials segment  the company believes it will continue to see solid growth in demand from its military  commuter and business jet customers 
there is also increasing demand for large commercial aircraft 
in this segment may surpass the company s goals for sales and profit growth 
in the building block chemicals segment  the company believes that it will be significantly impacted by the rapid increase in raw material and energy costs  particularly of natural gas in the united states 
a combination of slowing demand and increased competitive supply of the commodities produced by this segment has not supported adequate price increases to recover the cost increases 
it is likely that this segment will generate a moderate operating loss in large increases in raw material costs and operational problems together with a major softening of end market demand have led to a dramatic worsening of the financial condition of ac molding compounds 
due to operating losses  the company s net investment in ac moldings is now valued at zero  and the company is no longer recognizing its share of the losses of the joint venture 
the company and its joint venture partner have indicated an unwillingness to invest further in ac molding compounds 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a provision of against receivables due from the ac molding compounds joint venture 
the company continues to aggressively explore its strategic options for this joint venture with its partner
