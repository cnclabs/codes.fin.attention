item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the research  development and commercialization of products for the non invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease 
using innovative technologies  we are addressing such key problems in cardiac diagnosis as the identification of those at risk of sudden cardiac arrest and the early detection of coronary artery disease 
clinical research conducted to date has demonstrated that the presence of microvolt t wave alternans in patients with known  suspected or at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia predicts increased risk of a cardiac event such as ventricular tachyarrhythmia or sudden death 
sudden cardiac death accounts for approximately one half of all cardiac related deaths  or about  in the united states each year 
results of operations entering  limited published clinical data existed about our microvolt t wave alternans technology  virtually no third parties were reimbursing for the test in the united states and customers had to have budgeted funds available to purchase our ch stress test system in order to be able to perform a microvolt t wave alternans test 
during the year we made significant progress in our efforts to increase awareness of our microvolt t wave alternans technology and expanding the clinical use of the microvolt t wave alternans test 
we believe these developments will allow us to begin the transition from a company geared to achievement of development milestones to one focused on sales and marketing to achieve revenue growth and ultimately  profitability 
in march  we received notification from the ama  that their cpt editorial panel executive committee voted to establish a new category i cpt code for our microvolt t wave alternans test based upon their review of literature and data we submitted for their consideration 
the committee found that the data demonstrate microvolt t wave alternans testing is a predictor of risk of sudden death 
we are of the opinion that the new cpt code  when issued  should significantly improve the process for obtaining reimbursement for the microvolt t wave alternans test and provide our customers with an efficient means to submit claims and receive payment in a timely manner 
we made significant progress in the area of medical reimbursement for our microvolt t wave alternans test in several large third party private insurers began to pay healthcare providers for performing our microvolt t wave alternans test 
on average  these insurers are paying approximately for the test in addition to payments made for performing a standard stress test 
in august  medicare initiated payment for our test when performed on hospital out patients 
payment of approximately for the cost of the test s technical component is being made electronically utilizing the prospective payment system created by the health care financing administration 
we are also making progress toward obtaining coverage for medicare patients 
medicare s cardiology working group has developed a model coverage policy 
this policy will provide guidance to the local medicare carriers across the united states as to coverage and payment for our microvolt t wave alternans test 
this policy will be subject to modifications at the local level to allow for differences in local standards of care 
the results of three major clinical studies of microvolt t wave alternans were published for three critical patient populations during the year 
the march edition of the journal of the american college of cardiology reported the results of a study conducted at toho university in japan of patients with an acute myocardial infarction 
the journal reported that of the patients testing positive for microvolt t wave alternans had sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation during the following months  whereas of the patients testing negative for microvolt t wave alternans had no such events 
in august  in the prestigious british medical journal  the lancet  the results of a study performed on congestive heart failure patients found microvolt t wave alternans to be the most effective non invasive test studied to identify congestive heart failure patients at risk for developing life threatening abnormal heart rhythms 
finally  in december the journal of the american college of cardiology published the results of a company sponsored prospective multi center study of patients referred for an invasive electrophysiologic test  which we refer to as eps 
the study found that patients with a positive microvolt t wave alternans test were times more likely to have a serious ventricular arrhythmia or to die than patients with a negative test 
in comparison  patients with a positive eps were times more likely to have a serious ventricular arrhythmia or to die than patients with a negative eps 
in june  we received fda clearance to market our heartwave product 
the heartwave is an alternans only product that uses our micro v alternans sensors and our proprietary analytic spectral method to measure and collect alternans data at a microvolt level 
we have two models of the heartwave 
our heartwave system is designed for use with any manufacturer s standard stress test system to measure microvolt t wave alternans 
initial shipments to customers of this heartwave system began in september the heartwave ep system using the same microvolt t wave alternans technology and micro v alternans sensors  is designed to measure microvolt t wave alternans during the performance of an electrophysiology study and integrates with the hospital s electrophysiology monitoring equipment 
with the introduction of the heartwave  we began a planned expansion of our direct us sales organization 
during the second half of we added five additional sales representatives bringing the total number in our us sales force to ten 
the additional representatives have been added in major metropolitan areas with large healthcare infrastructures 
we plan to continue to expand our sales force throughout in may  we announced the formation of a strategic marketing alliance with spacelabs medical  inc under the agreement spacelabs will distribute our microvolt t wave alternans technology as a feature on its current diagnostic cardiac system 
the necessary software development work has been completed and tested  and we expect spacelabs to submitt a k to fda for approval in the very near future 
we expect initial shipments of the new product to begin in the second quarter of in march  we entered into an agreement with agilent technologies  inc  which we refer to as agilent  making them the exclusive distributor of our ch stress test system  within the us with agilent distributing the ch for stress  it allows us to concentrate our efforts on our patented microvolt t wave alternans products and technology 
the ch to be marketed by agilent  has been upgraded to be compatible with micorsoft windows during  we raised   net of issuance costs from the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share in two separate private placement transactions 
in addition  we issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share to the investors 
we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants for the purchase of an additional  shares of common stock with an exercise price of to the sales agent for both transactions 
in october  we strengthened our management team by hiring david a 
chazanovitz as our president and chief operation officer 
mr 
chazanovitz has over years of sales  marketing and general management experience in the medical products market ranging from early stage device companies to larger more established businesses 
he is the former president of cr bard electrophysiology and usci divisions and has as such has direct knowledge of the cardiology market 
for the past five years  mr 
chazanovitz has been a divisional president for nmt medical 
in february  mr 
chazanovitz was appointed our chief executive officer 
mr 
arnold  who was our chief executive officer from september to february  continues as a part time employee and chairman of the board of directors 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues were  during the twelve month period ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  and  during the twelve month period ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease during fiscal was led by a decline in sales during the first nine months of compared to the same period in this was the result of our decision to focus all of our sales efforts on our alternans technology and away from the standard stress test market  which had accounted for a major portion of our revenue in fiscal however  revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal increased over the average of the three previous quarters of fiscal this is primarily the result of the introduction of our new heartwave system during the third quarter and our focus on our microvolt t wave alternans technology 
us revenue was  during fiscal and  during fiscal  an increase of 
revenue from the sale of all microvolt t wave alternans products ch  heartwave  micro v alternans sensors during fiscal increased compared to fiscal sales of microvolt t wave alternans equipment  both our ch and heartwave products  increased  while sales of micro v alternans sensors increased during fiscal revenue from the sale of standard stress test systems declined in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting the change in focus away from the standard stress market 
international revenue was  during fiscal  and  during fiscal  a decrease of 
revenue from the sale of equipment declined in fiscal this is primarily the result of our japanese distributors efforts to reduce their inventory levels of ch in advance of the introduction of the heartwave to japan  which we anticipate will occur in the second half of revenue from the sale of micro v alternans sensors to international distributors in fiscal increased over fiscal our revenue recognition method for license fees is to recognize income ratably over the term of the license 
license fee revenue for fiscal and fiscal was  each year 
gross profit was of total revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease is the result of higher costs incurred on initial heartwave units shipped during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal these costs per unit are expected to decline as increased production volume will provide for improved utilization of fixed labor and overhead costs 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
costs associated with the design and development of our new heartwave products account for a major portion of the costs incurred during fiscal these costs are partially offset by reduced costs associated with lower levels of clinical and regulatory activity during fiscal when compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the growth in fiscal expenditures includes  costs incurred for the promotion of our new heartwave products  introduced late in fiscal  and  expenses in support of our efforts to gain favorable reimbursement from third party insurers  for healthcare providers for their performance of a microvolt t wave alternans tests 
in addition  we incurred costs associated with the recruitment and hiring of additional direct sales representatives in the second half of fiscal we anticipate that our costs during fiscal will increase  as we expect to continue the expansion of our us sales organization 
general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal as a result of costs incurred for the recruitment and hiring of key personnel 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase resulted from a higher level of invested cash resulting from the sale of  shares of our common stock in two private placements completed in january and september fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were  during the twelve month period ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  and  during the twelve month period ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  an increase of 
revenue from the sale of capital equipment and other miscellaneous products was  for fiscal and  for fiscal  a decline of 
revenue from the sale of disposable sensors was  for fiscal and  for fiscal  an increase of due primarily to increase in unit sales in the united states 
revenue from the sale of the ch and our micro v alternans sensors increased during fiscal while revenue from the sale of standard stress systems declined during the same period 
these results reflect our planned transition away from its previous sales focus on standard stress systems to one primarily focused on potential customers interested in the clinical use of our microvolt t wave alternans test and micro v alternans sensors 
us revenue from the sale of the ch and micro v alternans sensors increased during fiscal while revenue from the sale of standard stress test systems declined 
international revenue from the sale of the ch and micro v alternans sensors declined by during fiscal sales of all microvolt t wave alternans product to japan declined 
our japanese distributor fukuda denshi  ltd reduced its purchases during the year in an effort to reduce on hand inventories 
sales to all other international customers increased during fiscal sales of standard stress test systems increased  while revenue from the sale of the ch with the microvolt t wave alternans option and micro v alternans sensors increased during the same period 
we believe that our decision to change distribution partners in europe during fiscal has resulted in an improved focus and commitment to sale of our standard stress test and microvolt t wave alternans products 
gross profits declined to of total revenue in fiscal from for fiscal the decrease is due to the effect of the strong increase in the sale of products to our european distributors at industry standard distributor pricing  which is lower than commercial pricing  had a major effect on the gross profit percentage 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
fiscal included approximately  of costs associated with our patient multi center clinical study supporting the k filed with fda in august and cleared in april  for expansion of our labeling claims for microvolt t wave alternans 
these costs are partially offset by an increase in development costs associated with our new heartwave scheduled for introduction in selling  general and administrative were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the growth in fiscal expenditures reflects spending on initiatives designed to increase awareness of our microvolt t wave altenans technology and the clinical use of our microvolt t wave alternans test  as well as  programs supporting reimbursement from third party insurers for healthcare providers that perform the microvolt t wave alternans tests 
general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal due to cost incurred in support of our expanded information systems infrastructure and employee education and training programs 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
the reduction primarily reflects the impact of lower interest rates during fiscal on our short term cash investments partially offset by increased cash and marketable securities balances from the private placement of our common stock in june and october inflation and income taxes inflation did not have a significant effect on our results of operations for any of the years in the three year period ended december  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for the years    and because we incurred net losses in each of such years 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of  as well as  of federal and  of state tax credit carryforwards  available to offset future taxable income and income tax liabilities  respectively 
these carryforwards generally expire in the years through and may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in our ownership 
there can be no assurance that changes in ownership in future periods or continuing losses will not significantly limit our use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have generated taxable losses from operations since inception and  accordingly  have no taxable income available to offset the carryback of net operating losses 
in addition  although our operating plans anticipate taxable income in future periods  such plans provide for taxable losses over the near term and make significant assumptions which cannot be reasonably assured including market acceptance of our products by customers 
we have provided a full valuation allowance  at december  for our deferred tax assets since  in our opinion  realization of these future benefits is not sufficiently assured defined as a likelihood of slightly more than percent 
quarterly financial results the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for and in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

in addition  we used  of a  line of credit collateralized by the company s assets at the end of fiscal these financing activities offset cash used to fund the increased level of operations  with corresponding increases in most balance sheet accounts 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by  from december  to december   consistent with our net loss for fiscal net of total financing activities 
accounts receivable  net  increased by  during the year  reflecting the broadening of our customer base 
inventory remained level during the year 
fixed asset additions during the year primarily represent increased sales demonstration  clinical research units and additional information systems infrastructure 
the proceeds of our equity offerings have been used primarily to fund the accumulated deficit of  reflecting expenditures to support research  new product development and clinical trials activities  expansion of our sales organization  and to support an administrative infrastructure and the investment of approximately  in property and equipment through december  as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  we expect our capital expenditures to increase as we improve on the design of our products and support the expansion of our us sales organization 
we do not expect capital expenditures to exceed an aggregate of  over the next two years 
under the terms of various license  consulting and technology agreements  we are required to pay royalties on sales of our products 
minimum license maintenance fees under these license agreements  which are creditable against royalties otherwise payable for each year  range from  to  per year in total through we are committed to pay an aggregate of  of such minimum license maintenance fees subsequent to december  as part of these agreements  the company is also committed to meet certain development and sales milestones  including a requirement to spend a minimum of  in any two year period for research and development  clinical trials  marketing  sales and or manufacturing of products related to certain technology covered by the consulting and technology agreements 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital requirements through fiscal factors which may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
in this section  we  us and our refer to cambridge heart  inc 
unless the context otherwise requires 
risks related to our operations we have a history of net losses  we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability we are engaged primarily in the commercialization  manufacture  research and development of products for the non invasive diagnosis of heart disease 
we have incurred substantial and increasing net losses through december  we may never generate substantial revenues or achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in the future as we develop additional products and fund clinical trials of our product candidates 
our research and development expenses may also increase in the future as we supplement our internal research and development with additional third party technology licenses and potential acquisition of complementary products and technologies 
we also expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in connection with the continued expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
revenues generated from the sale of our products will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing of regulatory actions  progress of product development  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  varying pricing promotions and volume discounts to customers  competition  and the availability of third party reimbursement 
we have not been able to fund our operations from cash generated by our business  and if we cannot meet our future capital requirements  we may not be able to develop or enhance our technology  take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures 
we have principally financed our operations over the past year through the private placement of shares of our common stock 
if we do not generate sufficient cash from our business to fund operations or if we cannot obtain additional capital through equity or debt financings  we will be unable to grow as planned and may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities  develop new technology or respond to competitive pressures 
this could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
any additional financing we may need in the future may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of cambridge heart by our stockholders would be reduced and the securities issued could have rights  preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our current stockholders 
we depend on our microvolt t wave alternans technology for a significant portion of our revenues and if it does not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues could decline we believe that our future success will depend  in large part  upon the successful commercialization and market acceptance of our microvolt t wave alternans technology 
market acceptance will depend upon our ability to demonstrate the diagnostic advantages and cost effectiveness of this technology and upon our ability to obtain third party reimbursement for users of our technology 
the failure of our microvolt t wave alternans technology to achieve broad market acceptance  the failure of the market for our products to grow or to grow at the rate we anticipate  or a decline in the price of our products would reduce our revenues 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize or achieve market acceptance of our microvolt t wave alternans technology or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are superior to our technology 
the results of future clinical studies may not support the usefulness of our technology we have sponsored and are continuing to sponsor clinical studies relating to our microvolt t wave alternans technology and micro v alternans sensors to establish the predictive value of such technology 
although studies on high risk patients to date have indicated that the measurement of microvolt t wave alternans to predict the vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia is comparable to electrophysiology testing  we do not know whether the results of such studies  particularly studies involving patients who are not high risk  will continue to be favorable 
any clinical studies or trials which fail to demonstrate that the measurement of microvolt t wave alternans is at least comparable in accuracy to alternative diagnostic tests  or which otherwise call into question the cost effectiveness  efficacy or safety of our technology  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty responding to changing technology the medical device market is characterized by rapidly advancing technology 
our future success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with advancing technology and competitive innovations 
however  we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products 
in addition  we can give no assurance that new products or alternative diagnostic techniques may be developed that will render our current or planned products obsolete or inferior 
rapid technological development by competitors may result in our products becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do competition from competitors medical devices that diagnose cardiac disease is intense and likely to increase 
our success will depend on our ability to develop products and apply our technology and our ability to establish and maintain a market for our products 
we compete with manufacturers of electrocardiogram stress tests  the conventional method of diagnosing ischemic heart disease  as well as with manufacturers of other invasive and non invasive tests  including ep testing  electrocardiograms  holter monitors  ultrasound tests and systems of measuring cardiac late potentials 
many of our competitors and prospective competitors have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  research and development experience and regulatory  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
many of these competitors offer broad  well established product lines and ancillary services not offered by cambridge heart 
some of our competitors have long term or preferential supply arrangements with physicians and hospitals which may act as a barrier to market entry 
we depend heavily on independent manufacturers representatives and foreign distributors we currently market our products in the united states through a small direct sales force and independent manufacturers representatives 
we may not be able to continue to recruit and retain skilled sales management  direct sales persons or independent manufacturers representatives 
we market our products internationally through independent distributors 
these distributors also distribute competing products under certain circumstances 
the loss of a significant international distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business if a new distributor  sales representative or other suitable sales organization could not be found on a timely basis in the relevant geographic market 
to the extent that we rely on sales in certain territories through distributors  any revenues we receive in those territories will depend upon the efforts of our distributors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a distributor will market our products successfully or that the terms of any future distribution arrangements will be acceptable to us 
we obtain critical components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products from a limited group of suppliers  and if our suppliers fail to meet our requirements  we will be unable to meet customer demand and our customer relationships would suffer we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers 
our dependence on a single supplier or limited group of smaller suppliers for critical components and subassemblies exposes us to several risks  including a potential for interruption  or inconsistency in the supply of components or subassemblies leading to backorders and product shortages  a potential for inconsistent quality of components or subassemblies supplied  leading to reduced customer satisfaction or increased product costs  and inconsistent pricing 
disruption or termination of the supply of these components and subassemblies could cause delays in the shipment of our products  resulting in potential damage to our customer relations and reduced revenue 
from time to time in the past  we have experienced temporary difficulties in receiving timely shipment of key components from our suppliers 
we can give no assurance that we would be able to identify and qualify additional suppliers of critical components and subassemblies in a timely manner 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more key components or subassemblies included in our products could seriously harm our results of operations 
we will not be able to sell our products in the european common market if we are unable to obtain iso certification and to receive a ce mark certification for our products we are required to obtain iso certification and to receive a ce mark certification  an international symbol of quality and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
if we fail to receive a ce mark by june   we will be prohibited from selling our ch in the european common market after this date 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in meeting certification requirements 
if we fail to obtain iso certification or receive a ce mark certification  our sales would be reduced and our results of operations would be adversely impacted 
risks related to the market for cardiac diagnostic equipment we could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices entails the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls 
although we maintain product liability insurance in the united states and in other countries in which we conduct business  including clinical trials and product marketing and sales  such coverage may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent commercialization of the ch and the heartwave systems or cause a significant financial burden on cambridge heart  or both  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and ability to market the both systems as currently contemplated 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate levels of third party reimbursement our revenues currently depend and will continue to depend  to a significant extent  on sales of our ch and heartwave systems 
our ability to successfully commercialize these systems depends in part on the availability of  and our ability to obtain and maintain  adequate levels of third party reimbursement for use of these systems 
only limited reimbursement is currently available for performance of our microvolt t wave alternans test 
the amount of reimbursement in the united states that will be available for clinical use of the microvolt t wave alternans test is uncertain and may vary 
in the united states  the cost of medical care is funded  in substantial part  by government insurance programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and private and corporate health insurance plans 
third party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device has not received appropriate fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payer  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
our ability to commercialize the ch and heartwave systems successfully will depend  in large part  on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of performing an microvolt t wave alternans test are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
we do not know whether reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries for the microvolt t wave alternans test will increase  or will not be decreased in the future or that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  the ch and heartwave systems 
the unavailability of third party reimbursement or the inadequacy of the reimbursement for microvolt t wave alternans tests using the ch and heartwave systems would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop patentable products  enforce our patents and obtain patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
however  the patent positions of medical device companies  including cambridge heart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we can give no assurance that patents will issue from any patent applications we own or license or that  if patents do issue  the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  any issued patents we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights granted under issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  and we can give no assurance that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology  or disclose such technology or that we can ultimately protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
others could claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights our commercial success will depend in part on our neither infringing patents issued to others nor breaching the licenses upon which our products might be based 
we have licensed significant technology and patents from third parties  including patents and technology relating to microvolt t wave alternans and cardiac electrical imaging licensed from the massachusetts institute of technology 
our licenses of patents and patent applications impose various commercialization  sublicensing  insurance  royalty and other obligations on our part 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  licenses could convert from being exclusive to nonexclusive in nature or could terminate 
we could become involved in litigation over intellectual property rights the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
litigation  which would likely result in substantial cost to us  may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
in particular  our competitors and other third parties hold issued patents and are assumed to hold pending patent applications  which may result in claims of infringement against us or other patent litigation 
we also may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office  which could result in substantial cost  to determine the priority of inventions 
furthermore  we may have to participate at substantial cost in international trade commission proceedings to abate importation of products  which would compete unfairly with our products 
if we are not able to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us we rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology 
we can give no assurance that others will not independently develop or acquire substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or disclose such technology or that we can ultimately protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
we rely on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  advisors  vendors and consultants 
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements 
failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on cambridge heart
