liquidity and capital resources financial flexibility during and continuing into  the real estate industry experienced a reduced supply of favorably priced equity and debt capital  which generally decreased the level of new investment activity by real estate companies 
while the company has been subject to the same capital market conditions as other real estate companies  management believes the company s financial and liquidity position are relatively strong 
over the years  the company has carefully managed its balance sheet in an effort to avoid liquidity issues in any given quarter or year 
in management s view  this should provide a competitive advantage in the current capital constrained market over many of its competitors 
following are three key indicators that demonstrate the overall strength of the company s financial position 
first  the company believes that its strong balance sheet and expected real estate asset disposition proceeds will provide the company with sufficient capital to fund its investment activities 
second  the company has maintained a conservative balance sheet with a debt to market capitalization of at december  third  as of december   the company has a total of million of undrawn capacity on its existing lines of credit to meet its short term obligations 
management believes that these key factors will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility to capitalize on investment opportunities which may not be available to other real estate companies with more limited financial resources 
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to and by million in as compared to these increases are due primarily to the weeks merger in july  the development and acquisition of additional rental properties  and cash flow from existing real estate assets 
investing and financing activities during  and  the company invested net cash of million  million  and million  respectively  into real estate investing activities 
in  the company used the proceeds received from the disposal of real estate assets identified as result of its capital disposition strategy to fund its future development 
during  the company received approximately million of proceeds from land and depreciated property sales and a million capital distribution from an unconsolidated company which were used to fund development activities and reduce amounts outstanding on the company s line of credit 
the million invested in real estate in was financed primarily from the borrowings under the company s unsecured lines of credit 
these unsecured lines of credit were partially repaid with proceeds from the issuance of million of long term unsecured debt  million in net proceeds from the sale of common shares  and million of net proceeds from the sale of preferred shares 
the million invested in real estate during was financed primarily from borrowings under the company s line of credit 
these borrowings were partially repaid with proceeds from the issuance of million of long term unsecured debt  million in net proceeds from the sale of common shares  and million of net proceeds from the sale of preferred shares 
other significant financing activity included the payment of million  million  and million in common and preferred share distributions in  and  respectively 
the increases are primarily attributable to i an increase in the overall number of common shares and series f preferred shares outstanding resulting from the weeks merger in  and ii annual increases in the cash distributions paid per common share 
the company currently has on file a form s registration statement the shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission which has remaining availability as of december   of million to issue additional common stock  preferred stock and unsecured debt securities 
the company intends to issue additional securities under this shelf registration to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties 
the company also has a shelf registration on file for at the market offerings of million shares of common stock 
the company completed a million preferred stock offering in february the recurring capital needs of the company are funded primarily through the undistributed net cash provided by operating activities

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo  which is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated property  plus operating property depreciation and amortization and adjustments for minority interest and unconsolidated companies on the same basis  is the industry standard for reporting the operations of real estate investment trusts 
the following reflects the calculation of the company s ffo for the years ended december in thousands net income available for common shares    add back deduct depreciation and amortization    share of adjustments for unconsolidated companies    earnings from depreciated property sales    minority interest share of add backs funds from operations  cash flow provided by used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    the increase in ffo during the three year period results primarily from the increased in service rental property portfolio as discussed above under results of operations 
while management believes that ffo is the most relevant and widely used measure of the company s operating performance  such amount does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
accounting changes in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  as amended by statement no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june  these statements will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  then depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value will either be offset through earnings  against the change in fair value of hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in income 
the ineffective portion of a hedge s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in income 
the adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts in thousands of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair values of the company s debt instruments are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate secured debt       weighted average interest rate variable rate libor based secured debt   weighted average interest rate n a n a n a variable rate treasury based secured debt  weighted average interest rate unsecured notes       weighted average interest rate unsecured lines of credit    weighted average interest rate n a n a n a n a n a the company has four interest rate swap agreements outstanding which have an aggregate fair market value of  at december  three of the swap agreements mature on december   in conjunction with the maturity of an million unsecured syndicated bank term loan 
the fourth swap agreement is in conjunction with a million mortgage loan which matures january  along with the swap agreement 
as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates
