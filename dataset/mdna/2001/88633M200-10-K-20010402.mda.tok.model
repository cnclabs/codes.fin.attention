year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues ticketing services group 
revenues from tsg increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  with the successful performances by wango tango  backstreet boys  billy joel and wwf smack down  our revenues relating to service fees increased in correlation with the increase in ticket volume sales 
in addition  our revenue increased due to our performer charity ticket auctions as well as to new clients 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by lost revenue related to a large bay area seating service client who terminated its contract with us effective december  the termination resulted in a loss of approximately million in revenues in compared with the decrease in ticket volume due to the client termination was more than offset by new clients and single ticket sales from the sydney olympics games 
internet ticketing group 
revenues from itg increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  a full year of revenues from our acquisitions contributed approximately million of the increase 
the remaining increase was the result of increased ticket volume from our internet enabled software licensees 
included in itg s revenue for the year ended december  was million relating to the non cash portion of the sloc agreement 
international 
international revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we expect international revenues to continue to grow as we increase the number of software product licensees and internet enabled licensees in new markets and countries 
other 
other revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this reflects our exiting from the original internet portal strategy 
cost of services ticketing services group 
cost of services for tsg increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of tsg revenues  total cost of services for tsg increased to from 
the increase was mainly attributable to costs related to charity ticket auctions  which primarily consist of the face value of the tickets and amounts due to the charitable organizations 
additionally  the increase was attributable to the cost of guaranteed tickets for the wango tango event 
these costs were partially offset by a decline in our client s share of service fees consistent with the decline of ticket volume related to the loss of a large bay area seating service client in december internet ticketing group 
cost of services for itg increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  a full year of costs from our acquisitions contributed approximately million of the increase 
the current year also includes cost of services related to the growth in our license and support business  including services for the salt lake olympic winter games 
as a percentage of itg revenue  cost of services decreased to from 
international 
cost of services for international increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily caused by cost of services from our acquired subsidiary  dataculture  in august other 
other cost of services decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was consistent with the decrease in revenue due to our change in business strategy from an internet portal 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to from 
the decrease is mainly attributable to the decline in professional services  reflecting the issuance of warrants to performers in the prior year as well as termination of our relationship with an advertising agency in the year ended december  the decrease also reflects a reduction in advertising expenses as we continue to focus our efforts on our clients instead of building our brand 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to decrease as we further direct our effort from high cost branding to combined client driven advertising and promotions  a strategy that emphasizes our client relationships 
technology development 
technology development expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  of this increase   was related to technology development expenses from our acquired subsidiaries 
as a percentage of total revenues  technology development expenses decreased to from 
the decrease reflects our efforts to consolidate software code lines 
the consolidation enables us to reduce costs as we support the development of fewer software products 
we continue efforts to improve and expand our core ticketing system  and we expect a greater stabilization of our expenses and additional benefits from consolidation as we reduce our development efforts to a support function for a single ticketing system 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to from in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase was due to an increase in professional services expenses  related to legal costs associated with our litigation with ticketmaster  and a write off of approximately million of acquisition costs related to an abandoned merger with first call international  ltd  a united kingdom ticketing services and software provider 
bad debt expenses contributed million of the increase 
our acquisitions contributed approximately million of additional administration costs from continuing multiple operations 
the remainder of the increase was the result of payroll and related expenses  including travel  supplies  computer maintenance and telephone expenses representing investments in our managerial and administrative infrastructure to facilitate our growth  an increase in depreciation of million  resulting from capital expenditures during and  an increase in insurance and business taxes of million  an increase in office rent and related expenses of  and an increase in accounting fees and professional fees for investor relations of  we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decline as we continue to integrate operations of our acquired subsidiaries  including consolidation of administration functions and reduction in office space 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the amortization of goodwill from acquisitions that occurred in restructuring charge 
in connection with the new strategy  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
the restructure charges comprise million related to the write off of certain intangible assets  million related to the consolidation of facilities  million of involuntary termination benefits and  related to terminated contracts 
the write off of certain intangible assets represents a noncash impairment charge 
due to the abandonment of the ticketing portal strategy and the planned reduction in code lines  we determined certain intangible assets  related to the acquisitions of california tickets 
com and lasergate systems  inc  met the test for impairment 
accordingly  we have reduced the carrying value of the related long lived assets to their estimated fair value  determined based upon a discounted cash flow method 
we also reviewed the estimated lives of certain of our long lived assets which resulted in shortened lives and the acceleration of amortization expense for certain intangible assets 
the impairment charge had no impact on our cash flows for the year ended december  or our ability to generate cash flows in the future 
in conjunction with the review for impairment  the remaining estimated lives of some long lived assets were shortened  offsetting the benefit to amortization expense of a reduced carrying value 
purchased in process research and development 
the purchased in process research and development charges recorded during the year ended december  were recorded in conjunction with the acquisitions of california tickets 
com and ticketslive 
the amounts recorded  million for california tickets 
com and million for ticketslive  represented the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects reflecting the risk adjusted cash flows and the state of completion 
at the date of acquisition  the projects associated with the in process research and development efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed 
ticketslive was conducting development activities associated with the completion of the next generation of select  ticketslive s automated ticketing system 
the projects under development were to increase speed and expand functionality  flexibility and reporting 
california tickets 
com was in the process of completing customization and development of its web site and transaction processing systems 
since we already had these systems in place  the projects  which were in varying stages of completion  were of no continuing value to us 
total other income expense 
total other income expense consists principally of interest income and interest expense 
interest income is generated primarily from cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing accounts

these factors contributing to our increase in net loss before extraordinary item  were offset by the following factors an increase in total revenues in  net of acquisitions  of million and  increased net benefit of million in other income expense  and million of purchased in process research and development in the prior year second quarter  million of non employee stock based compensation  the decrease in the net loss per share reflects the increase in our basic and diluted weighted average shares of million 
this increase is due to the conversion of our preferred shares to million shares of common and our initial public offering totaling million shares that was completed in november the convertible preferred stock and other potentially dilutive securities including stock options were antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues ticketing services group 
revenues from tsg decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the acquisition of protix  inc contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  excluding the acquisitions  overall ticket volume would have decreased  tickets  or million  primarily because of the impact during the year of contract terminations by clients obtained through our acquisition of bay area seating service in as of december   we had ceased providing services to these clients 
the decrease in our ticket volume from these terminations resulted in approximately a million decrease in revenues

the purchased in process research and development charges recorded during the year ended december  were recorded in conjunction with the acquisitions of california tickets

california tickets 
com was in the process of completing customization and development of its web site and transaction processing systems 
since we already had these systems in place  the projects  which were in varying stages of completion  were of no continuing value to us 
in making our purchase price allocation  we considered present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs  an assessment of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to in process research and development were determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from each project  excluding the cash flows related to the portion of each project that was incomplete at the acquisition date  and discounting the resulting net cash flows to their present value 
each of the project forecasts was based upon future discounted cash flows  taking into account the state of development of each in process project  the costs to complete that project  the expected income stream  the life cycle of the product ultimately developed  and the associated risks 
aggregate revenue attributable to the in process research and development projects was estimated to peak  as a percentage of total revenue  in for california tickets

losses from acquisitions of million 
these factors contributing to our increase in net loss before extraordinary item  were offset by the following factors an increase in software services and other revenues in  net of acquisitions  of million and  the net loss reflects a write off resulting from the impairment of long lived assets acquired in our acquisition of bay area seating service of million 
the decrease in the net loss per share reflects the increase in our basic and diluted weighted average shares of million 
this increase is due to the conversion of our preferred shares to million shares of common and our initial public offering totaling million shares that was completed in november the convertible preferred stock and other potentially dilutive securities including stock options were antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million as of december  from december  the decrease resulted primarily from net cash used in operating activities of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  equity investments in strategic partners of million  acquisitions of million and payments on long term debt and leases of million 
these uses were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
cash used in operating activities was primarily for the funding of losses before depreciation  amortization  restructuring charges and certain non cash marketing expenses of million and decreases in accounts payable of million and deferred revenue and other liabilities of million and increases in accounts receivable of million and prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
we expect to begin to generate positive cash flows from operations by the end of calendar however  existing cash balances are expected to be insufficient to cover our requirements until that time  by approximately million 
in addition  our present cash balances will only be sufficient to pay ongoing cash expenses only until approximately the end of the second quarter of given our current cash balances and expected cash requirements  for  we believe that it will be necessary for us to raise additional funds quickly in order for us to continue our operations 
although we are currently in discussions with two potential investors  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding in the near future on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to raise additional funding in a timely manner will place us in significant financial jeopardy 
tax matters net operating loss carryforwards from inception to december   we have incurred net tax operating losses of approximately million 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of million because of the uncertainty of its realization 
we account for deferred income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the likelihood of realizing deferred income taxes 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of losses from operations  expected future losses  and limitations on the amount of net operating losses that we may utilize in any one year 
for further information about our net operating loss carryforwards  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
under the tax reform act of  the benefits from net operating losses carried forward may be impaired or limited in some circumstances 
events which may cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that we may utilize in any one year include  but are not limited to  a cumulative ownership change of more than over a three year period 
at december   we were subject to such limitations  in the amount of approximately million per year 
the impact of any additional limitations that may be imposed for future issuances of equity securities  including issuances with respect to acquisitions  has not been determined 
non qualified stock options as of march   we had outstanding non qualified stock options to purchase  shares issued to various employees  consultants and directors under our stock options plans 
each option entitles its holder to purchase a share of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately 
on exercise of an option  we will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the difference between the exercise price of the option and the then fair market value of the common stock 
as the exercise of the options is at the sole discretion of the holder of the options  the timing of the corresponding income tax deduction is outside of our control 
forward looking information under the private securities litigation reform act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the act was designed to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves without fear of litigation 
the prospective information must be identified as forward looking and must be accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statements 
the statements about our plans  strategies  intentions  expectations and prospects contained throughout the document are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially from those predicted as of the date of this report in the forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in addition  past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends 
stockholders are also directed to the other risks discussed in our registration statement on form s no 
 as amended  as filed with the securities and exchange commission 
tickets 
com does not undertake to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
forward looking information regarding revenue growth and execution of our business plan outlined below are certain factors that may preclude us from meeting our revenue expectations and fulfilling our business strategy 
we need additional funding to continue our operations and may not be able to obtain it in a timely fashion or on satisfactory terms 
we are operating with very limited cash resources and need to obtain additional funds to continue our planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on satisfactory terms in the near future  we will have to modify our business plan  reduce or discontinue some or all of our operations  seek a buyer for substantially all of our assets or seek bankruptcy protection 
our short term and long term ability to meet our liquidity requirements and to continue operations will depend on our ability to raise additional funding 
we are in the process of negotiating additional financing from two potential investors  however  there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
because of our limited operating history and limited internet experience  our revenues are unpredictable  which may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to predict future results of operations and difficult for you to evaluate us or our prospects 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and that the results for any period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors in some future quarter 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete makes forecasting more difficult and potentially unreliable 
our current and future expense levels are based predominantly on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues  and are to a large extent fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
accordingly  if our revenues in any particular quarter are lower than anticipated  our operating results would likely fall short of market expectations 
the seasonality of the live entertainment industry could cause our quarterly operating results to fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
many popular live entertainment events are held during the warm weather months 
in addition  ticket sales for such events generally commence several months prior to the event date 
because of these factors  our business generally has lower revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
these seasonality issues could cause our quarterly operating results to fall below market expectations  and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
other related seasonality issues that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the future include the dates event tickets are released for sale by our clients  the decisions of one or more clients to cancel or postpone events  the timing of large  nonrecurring events  and the concentration of events in any given quarter 
if we fail to retain clients of acquired companies  we may experience a loss of revenue 
in order to achieve our intended growth and market presence  we must satisfy our current clients needs  as well as the needs of clients of acquired companies 
if we fail to do so  we may lose significant clients and the revenue we generate from those clients 
we may lose key personnel of acquired companies  which could adversely affect our relationships with major clients or strategic partners and impair the effectiveness of our operations 
key personnel may choose not to continue their employment with us for reasons including compensation  location  and the perception of career opportunities with us  our competitors  or in other industries 
if we lose key personnel  our relationships with major clients or strategic partners who had close relationships with these personnel may be impaired 
in addition  if we are unable to replace any key personnel that we may lose  we may suffer a disruption of operations and a decline in revenue 
because we have a limited operating history as a consolidated business  we have an unproven business model 
since  we have completed eleven acquisitions of companies with diverse backgrounds in the ticketing industry 
we have a limited history operating as a consolidated business  and accordingly  an unproven business model that is substantially dependent on the growth of revenues from increased ticket sales on the internet 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in increasing our internet sales in future periods 
if we are not  our revenues will not grow in accordance with our business model and may fall short of expectations of market analysts and investors  which could negatively affect the price of our common stock 
we have limited experience in offering e commerce services to consumers and may not be able to generate substantial revenues from internet sales 
we began online ticket sales in the third quarter of historically  we have sold tickets primarily through retail stores and telephone sales centers 
in order to generate substantial revenues from online ticket sales  we must significantly increase the number of clients who use our online ticketing services 
we cannot be certain that a substantial number of our clients will be able or choose to use our online ticketing services 
the majority of our clients license our in house systems for internal use and do not use any of our other outsourcing services 
these clients generally use software systems that do not enable ticket sales over the internet without a specific software upgrade 
to date  only a portion of our clients are able to use our internet ticketing services 
as more of our clients use our online services  we may encounter technological difficulties that could impair our ability to increase online revenues 
in order for most of our clients to use our online ticketing capabilities  we must develop and install additional software to make their systems compatible with ours 
this process can be difficult we may encounter technological difficulties that may inhibit us from servicing our clients online  which may cause or more of our clients to terminate or fail to renew its contract with us 
because we have a broad portfolio of in house systems  we must either create separate internet interfaces for each of these products or consolidate our in house systems 
we may experience difficulties in further consolidating our portfolio of in house systems into a few comprehensive in house systems and in developing links from our clients various software and hardware systems to our ticketing systems and databases 
due to these potential technological difficulties  some clients may be averse to change and may require a lengthy sales cycle before they will upgrade to internet ticketing on our system 
ticketmaster corporation has filed a lawsuit against us which could impair our ability to implement our business model and result in substantial payments to them 
the ticketmaster suit could result in limitations on how we implement our e commerce strategy  delays and costs associated with payments to ticketmaster corporation 
in addition  the litigation could result in significant expenses and diversion of our management s time and other resources see note in item financial statements 
infringement or other claims could adversely affect our ability to market our products  limit our rights to certain technology and harm our results of operations 
although we believe we have valid proprietary rights to all of our intellectual property  we could be subject to claims of alleged trademark  patent or other infringement as a result of our actions or the actions of our licensees 
for example  as in the ticketmaster claim  we may in the future be sued because we link consumers directly to an internal page within other ticket sellers web sites and have included the trademarks of these ticket sellers on our web site 
any litigation over intellectual property rights or business practices could result in payment by us of substantial damages  injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to market or license our products  and the loss of rights to technologies necessary to operate portions of our business 
any litigation  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of managerial and other 
our proprietary technology and intellectual property may be inadequately protected  which could harm our competitive position 
we rely on trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our technology and our brand 
we also rely on confidentiality and or license and other agreements with employees  customers  and others to protect our proprietary rights 
we have no patents 
despite our efforts to control access to our proprietary information  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  technologies or other intellectual property without authorization 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark  trade secret and patent protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries that do not offer protection comparable to that provided by united states laws 
internet technologies are evolving rapidly  and third parties may also develop similar or superior technologies independently 
any unauthorized use of our proprietary information could result in costly and time consuming litigation to enforce our proprietary rights 
in addition  any third party development of similar or superior technologies could impede our ability to compete effectively in the ticketing industry 
ineffective protection of our trademarks and service marks could reduce the value of our brands 
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken and will take to protect our brands will be adequate  and such steps may require considerable expenditures 
nor can we be certain that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate the copyrights  trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights that currently protect our brands 
ineffective protection of these rights could reduce the value of our brands 
we have registered the tradename tickets 
com and the stylized trademark 
tickets  the service mark advantix and other trademarks in the united states 
we have also applied to register the tradenames tickets 
com in various foreign countries 
effective trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection will not be available or sought in every country in which our products and services are available online or by telephone 
we may not be able to obtain effective trademark or service mark registration until the prolonged use of our marks has generated secondary meaning for purposes of trademark and service mark law 
in addition  there are other parties who have corporate names or brand names very similar to ours  and whose names may also include the term tickets  and who may  as a result  bring claims against us for trademark infringement or challenge our rights to register the tradename tickets 
com  the stylized trademark 
tickets  or both 
our licensees could diminish the quality of our brands and adversely affect our reputation 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brands are maintained by these licensees  we cannot be certain that these licensees will not take actions that might materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or reputation 
if we are not able to preserve our domain names we may not be able to compete effectively on the internet 
we currently hold the internet domain names tickets 
com  protix 
com  bass tix 
com  basstickets 
com  fantastix 
com and others 
we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
any such inability could impair our ability to compete effectively on the internet 
the acquisition and maintenance of domain names are generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees 
the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries is subject to change 
governing bodies may establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all countries in which we conduct or intend to conduct business 
in addition  the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
online security breaches could result in a loss of consumer confidence in e commerce  which could impair our ability to implement our business model 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining consumer and supplier confidence in our services 
any publicized security problems affecting us or other e commerce companies could inhibit the growth of e commerce and  accordingly  the growth of our internet sales revenue as contemplated in our business model 
we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including credit card numbers 
we cannot be certain that our security measures will prevent security breaches  including break ins  viruses or disruptions by consumers or others 
a party that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information  damage our database or communications lines or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations 
security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry coverage limits that may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
system failures could damage our reputation and result in the loss of customers and clients 
our business is almost entirely dependent on our call centers  computer systems and telecommunications systems 
heavy stress placed on our systems during peak periods could cause our systems to operate at unacceptably low speeds or fail altogether 
any significant degradation or failure of our systems or any other systems in the ticketing process  including telephone or telecommunications services  even for a short time  could cause consumers to suffer delays in ticket purchases 
the resulting inconvenience to consumers could damage our reputation with the public  cause consumers to purchase tickets from other sources and deter repeat customers 
delays in services could also cause substantial losses for clients  which could result in claims against us 
these delays could also result in the termination or non renewal of our existing service agreements 
in the future  increased volume due to growth  if any  may require us to expend substantial funds to expand and further upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
any inability to add additional software and hardware on a timely basis to accommodate increased traffic on our web site may cause unanticipated system disruptions and result in slower response times 
in addition  substantially all of our server equipment is currently located in california in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes 
we do not presently have fully redundant systems  a formal disaster recovery plan or alternative providers of hosting services  nor do we carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for all of the possible losses that we may incur 
in addition  our clients in house systems also may be subject to failures and degradations that could interrupt ticket sales both through clients systems and on our web site 
unanticipated problems may cause a significant system outage or data loss  and result in the loss of clients 
the process of integrating technologies from our current and future acquisitions could disrupt our ticketing systems and damage our relationships with our clients 
the process of integrating the various technologies of acquired companies into one interactive system has caused  and may in the future cause  system downtime and other system disruptions 
we expect to integrate and consolidate several of our in house systems over the next several years 
we may experience system failures in the future as a result of this integration  which could impair our relationships with our clients 
any system failures could cause one or more of our clients to terminate its contract or fail to renew its contract with us 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position because of the intense competition in the ticketing industry 
intense competition in the ticketing industry presents significant challenges to management  marketing and technical personnel 
we believe competition will become more challenging as the market for tickets expands and technology advances 
our primary competitor on a national level is ticketmaster corporation  which has operations in multiple locations throughout the united states 
ticketmaster corporation has a widely recognized brand name in the live event ticketing business  a longer operating history in the ticketing industry generally and in internet ticketing specifically  more extensive ticketing inventory and greater financial and other resources than we do 
we commenced our operations in may and did not begin to sell tickets on the internet until october because of our limited operating history  we have not yet gained the same level of brand recognition or accumulated as broad a ticketing inventory as ticketmaster corporation 
in addition  because we have developed through the acquisition of smaller  regional outsourcing services providers and in house systems developers  we are still in the early stages of developing a strong national presence 
our competitors also include a number of smaller  regional outsourcing services providers  international and national in house systems providers  entertainment organizations that handle their own ticket sales and distribution through online and other distribution channels  international  national and local outsourcing services providers  which may or may not currently offer online transactional capabilities 
many of these competitors have greater brand recognition  longer operating histories and a greater number of well established client relationships than we do in the geographic regions in which they operate 
because of our relatively short operating history and presence in a limited number of geographic regions prior to our move into e commerce  we have not yet established a significant competitive position in a number of geographic areas 
in order to maintain our competitive position in the ticketing industry  we must be able to attract new clients and ticket inventory  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so 
if we cannot attract new clients and ticket inventory  or if we lose clients to other outsourcing services providers or otherwise  we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the ticketing industry 
in recent years  the live entertainment industry has been moving toward consolidation 
as a result  contracts for outsourcing services are often negotiated on a multi venue basis  and large ticket inventories are concentrated in the hands of a few entertainment conglomerates 
because outsourcing services contracts are often multi year contracts and there are fewer potential new clients  competition for their business is especially intense 
historically  we have grown our business primarily through acquisitions 
industry consolidation has reduced the number of viable acquisition candidates and  accordingly  limited future acquisition opportunities 
in order to increase our client base and ticket inventory  we may need to attract clients who currently have relationships with other outsourcing services providers 
at the same time  other outsourcing services providers will likely attempt to attract our current clients to use their outsourcing services 
in addition  our clients may terminate their contracts for a variety of reasons  or may not renew their contracts at the end of their terms 
our reliance on third party software and hardware makes us vulnerable to changes in our suppliers products and services  which could adversely affect our ability to service our clients in a timely manner 
our automated ticketing solutions incorporate software products and use computer hardware and equipment developed by other entities 
our reliance on third party software and hardware makes us vulnerable to changes in our suppliers products and services and any such changes may impair our ability to provide adequate outsourcing services and in house systems to our clients in a timely manner 
for example  we cannot be certain that all of our suppliers will remain in business or will continue to support the product lines that we use 
nor can we be certain that their product lines will remain viable or will otherwise continue to be available to us 
our current suppliers could significantly alter their pricing in a manner adverse to us 
if any of these entities ceases to do business  abandons or fails to enhance a particular product line  or significantly raises its prices  we may need to seek other suppliers 
we cannot be certain that other suppliers will be able to provide us with necessary products at favorable prices  or at all 
we depend on retail stores to reach consumers  and if we cannot maintain these relationships and establish new relationships  our ticket sales would be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our ticket sales are generated through arrangements with retail stores 
our contracts with these retail stores are generally for a one year term  and subject to periodic negotiations regarding sales commissions  customer service and other matters 
these stores cater to consumers who are likely to purchase tickets for sporting and entertainment events  and are attractive to other ticketing services 
if we cannot maintain good retail relationships and continue to establish new relationships  our ability to reach consumers and generate sufficient ticket sales could be materially and adversely affected 
we may become subject to more restrictive e commerce regulation that could adversely affect our ability to increase internet sales 
we are subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations applicable to e commerce directly 
currently  we believe that there are few laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet and online ticketing services 
it is likely  however  that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or commercial online services that could affect our online ticketing services 
any new legislation or regulation  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could restrict our ability to grow our business according to our plan 
laws regulating e commerce might cover matters such as  among other things  user privacy and the use of our consumer database for email marketing purposes  limitations on ticket service fees  the content of our web site  taxation by states where we sell tickets  copyright protection for us and competing ticketing services  distribution  direct linking  antitrust and consumer protection laws 
in addition  the applicability of a variety of existing laws in various jurisdictions to the internet and commercial online services may take years to resolve 
these issues may include property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy  among others 
for example  tax authorities in a number of states currently are reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in e commerce 
new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes 
we may be affected by changes in laws and standards relating to data collection and use practices and the privacy of internet users 
recent growing public concern regarding privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about internet users has led to increased federal and state scrutiny and legislative and regulatory activity concerning data collection and use practices 
various federal and state governments and agencies have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
in october  the european union adopted a directive that limits the collection and use of information regarding internet users in europe 
in addition to government activity  a number of industry and privacy advocacy groups are considering various new  additional or different self regulatory standards 
this focus  and any legislation  regulations or standards promulgated  may impact us 
although our compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on us  governments  trade associations and industry self regulatory groups may enact more burdensome laws  regulations and guidelines  including consumer privacy laws  affecting us and our customers 
since many of the proposed laws or regulations are just being developed  and a consensus on privacy and data usage has not been reached  we cannot yet determine the impact these regulations may have on our business 
however  these regulations and guidelines could adversely affect our business 
forward looking information regarding cost of services we may become subject to state regulation of ticket sales  which could impose restrictions on the manner and pricing of our ticket sales 
many states and municipalities have adopted statutes regulating ticketing transactions within their jurisdictions 
we cannot be certain whether any of these laws and regulations may be determined to be applicable to our business or whether new laws and regulations potentially adverse to our business will be adopted 
if we become subject to additional laws and regulations  the manner and pricing of our ticket sales may be restricted  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
some states and municipalities require that ticket sellers obtain a resellers license 
one or more states or municipalities could take the position that a telephonic or electronic ticket sale to one of their residents is a sufficient basis for application of that jurisdiction s reseller statute 
because we believe these statutes to be inapplicable to our activities  we may not be in compliance with these statutes 
governmental agencies or authorities could also argue that other state or local licensing or ticket scalping statutes apply to our activities 
these statutes  among other things  limit the amount of service charges and other fees that may be charged in connection with ticket sales 
other state and local regulations establish maximum service fees on tickets for certain sporting and other events 
forward looking information regarding operating expenses if we cannot effectively integrate our numerous recent acquisitions  we may experience increased costs  operating inefficiencies  system disruptions and the loss of clients 
the integration of acquired companies into a cohesive business requires the combination of different business models  financial  accounting and other internal systems  varied technologies and personnel who have dissimilar expertise and backgrounds 
it also requires the management of companies or operating units that are geographically dispersed throughout the united states and internationally 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations  personnel or systems of these acquired companies in a timely fashion  if at all 
if we fail to integrate operations and personnel effectively  we will experience duplication of costs and operating inefficiencies 
if we are unable to integrate technologies successfully  we may experience system disruptions or failures that could result in the dissatisfaction or loss of clients 
we also cannot be certain that we will achieve value from our acquisitions commensurate with the consideration paid 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from any acquired companies  we will experience an unanticipated shortfall in revenue and may fail to meet the expectations of investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
the process of integrating our recent acquisitions has placed and will continue to place a significant burden on our management team 
integration is complex  and presents numerous risks and uncertainties in addition to those set forth above  including the following if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel in a cost effective and timely manner  we may not be able to execute our growth strategy 
the significant growth of our business over the past two years due to our acquisition of eight companies has placed substantial demands on our management and other personnel 
our future growth  if any  will depend in part on our ability to attract  motivate and retain skilled technical  sales and management personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we expect it to increase as e commerce expands 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  a significant portion of our workforce is comprised of telephone sales representatives 
we compete with telemarketing firms  among others  for telephone sales personnel and sometimes must pay premium hourly wages to attract and retain them 
in addition  their high turnover rate increases our recruiting and training costs 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to hire and retain qualified personnel to support our planned growth in a cost effective or timely manner 
if we cannot  our ability to execute our growth strategy could be impaired 
the loss of personnel could require us to provide costly severance packages  which could adversely affect our operating results 
although we have employment agreements with several of our executive officers  including our chief executive officer  our executive officers and key employees may terminate their employment at any time for any reason 
in some circumstances  termination of their employment could result in substantial payments by us for severance benefits under these employment agreements 
acquisitions will create charges to earnings that could adversely affect our operating results and  accordingly  the market price of our common stock 
as a result of past acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill that will adversely affect our operating results for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  which must be amortized in the future and will result in a reduction of our earnings 
if the amount of recorded goodwill or other intangible assets is increased or we have future losses and are unable to demonstrate our ability to recover the amount of goodwill  the amount of amortization could be increased or the period of amortization could be shortened 
this would increase annual amortization charges or result in a write off of goodwill in a one time  non cash charge  which could be significant based on our acquisitions to date 
we may face liability for online content that may not be covered by our insurance 
because we are disseminating information  we may face liability for the nature and content of the materials on our web site or on sites to which we have links 
these liability claims could include  among others  claims for defamation  negligence  indecency  fraud from secondary sales  and copyright  patent and trademark infringement 
these claims have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against online services 
although we intend to maintain general liability insurance coverage  it may not cover claims of these types 
it also may not be adequate to indemnify us for any liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our ability to effectively operate our web site 
forward looking information regarding liquidity and capital resources we may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
on december   nasdaq sent us a deficiency notice  informing us that we had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of over the previous consecutive trading days as required by nasdaq marketplace rules and that we would be provided calendar days to regain compliance 
as of march   we failed to increase our bid price to at least  for a minimum of consecutive days 
on march   nasdaq provided us with written notification of the staff s determination to delist our common stock 
we have appealed the delisting determination and a nasdaq hearing has been scheduled for may  after the hearing  if nasdaq is not satisfied with our response to their concerns  then nasdaq may delist our common stock at any time without further notice to us 
if nasdaq delists our common stock  then our common stock may be traded on the otc bulletin board or the pink sheets  or not traded at all 
many institutional and other investors refuse to invest in stocks that are traded at levels below the nasdaq national market which could make our effort to raise capital more difficult 
in addition  the firms that currently make a market for our common stock could discontinue that role 
otc bulletin board and pink sheet stocks are often lightly traded or not traded at all on any given day 
any reduction in liquidity or active interest on the part of the investors in our common stock could have adverse consequences on our holders either because of reduced market prices or a lack of a regular  active trading market for our common stock 
our stock price has been and may continue to be very volatile  which may make us a target of securities class action litigation 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
in the future we may be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and other resources 
other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in securities analysts and investors expectations as to our future financial performance  changes in market valuations of other internet or online services companies  announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations  new services  significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss of a major venue or client  announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us or developments in those proceedings  and future sales of our common stock 
we face risks from international operations that could adversely affect our cash flow and licensing revenues 
we have only recently commenced operations in a number of international markets and a key component of our strategy is to expand our business internationally 
our plans to expand internationally are subject to inherent risks  including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates could expose us to losses because some of our contracts and liabilities are payable in foreign currencies 
payments due to our acquisition of dataculture  ltd 
are payable in pounds sterling over equal quarterly installments 
in addition  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
if the united states dollar becomes weaker against foreign currencies these payments will be greater in dollar terms and our cash flow would be adversely affected 
if we cannot adequately enforce our intellectual property rights internationally  we may lose licensing revenues 
many of our foreign business relationships involve the licensing of our software products 
if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights because they are not recognized under foreign laws  our customers could duplicate or modify our software products without our consent and deprive us of licensing revenues 
inflation and foreign currency risk inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the periods covered by the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we are not presently subject to significant foreign exchange risk as international operations currently constitute a minor part of our operations 
however  some of the recent companies we have acquired have operations internationally that could subject us to inflation and foreign currency risks in the future 
if we are affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations in the countries where we will have operations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected
