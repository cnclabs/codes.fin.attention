item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and other information included in this report 
the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey pasta company was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  california area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide a variety of products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states  selected regions in canada  and part of latin america 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey pasta company brand name by distributing its gourmet products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s product distribution to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  by december  declined to approximately  as of december  and increased  once again  to approximately  stores by december  during  and  significant costs were incurred to promote the expansion that occurred  including product demonstration  advertising  warehousing  and distribution costs and the hiring of additional personnel 
in  the focus was changed to developing a profitable distribution base 
hence  the reduction in store totals  and the return to profitability 
during through the company added profitable retail and club distribution including approximately additional club stores  retail stores as part of the march  frescala foods acquisition  and several new retail chains comprising approximately  stores 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue will depend on three key factors whether grocery and club store chains will continue to increase the number of their stores offering the company s products  whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products  and continued introduction of new products that meet consumer acceptance 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores  and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future or that such chains will not reduce the number of stores carrying the company s products 
the company believes that access to substantially greater capital resources  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs as a percent of sales revenue  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company has developed  and is continuing to develop new products for consumers and revised advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
operations for  and net revenues from continuing operations were   and  for   and  respectively  reflecting an annual increase in sales of for  when compared to  and a increase for when compared to the and increases resulted from increased store numbers from approximately  at the end of to approximately  individual grocery and club stores by year end of  and approximately  at year end gross margin remained close to the level at compared with  although the last two quarters of evidenced an upward trend in gross margin at and respectively 
the increase came after the company experienced a decline in to from the prior year 
the decline was caused by excess distribution expenses arising from outside warehouse arrangements which were replaced by a company run distribution complex in december  slightly lower gross margin percent caused by the conversion of most of the remaining customers to restaurant style product by the fourth quarter of  and expenses associated with intensive new product development efforts 
in addition  lower gross margin percent was experienced in on the frescala foods sales over the first six months of operation after the march purchase until the san antonio  texas facility was closed and the business fully assimilated into the salinas  california plant 
significant packaging and label write offs  extensive new product development and introduction  and a higher ratio of lower gross margin private label business influenced the gross profit percent 
although the private label gross margins are lower than those of other customers  operating margins are comparable  as there are few related deductions below the gross profit line 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to  up  or from  in  which had increased  or from the expense level reflected the first year sg a expenses increased since when they were million 
the expense level was materially reduced in to million as a result of redefined marketing focus  and facilities consolidation from san francisco to salinas  with reduced headcount and related overhead expenses implemented in late and early further decreases in administrative costs continued during with a million reduction in professional fees  public reporting expense  insurance costs  and other administrative expenses  partially offset by increased expenses in the sales and marketing area related to new customers and stores 
in  variable costs associated with the sales increase  additional product demonstration expense related to the added club store business  full year expense for two marketing positions  and normal wage and salary inflation contributed to the increase over the increase in over resulted primarily from variable costs associated with the sales increase 
sg a expenses as a percent of sales were  and for   and  respectively 
management believes the current level of sg a expenses is consistent with efficient operations  and additional expenses in future periods  mainly in the sales and marketing area  will be directly associated with increased levels of sales 
depreciation and amortization expense  included in cost of sales and sg a  increased to  or of net revenues in  compared to  or of net revenues in  and  or in the increases over the past two years relate primarily to capital expenditures in the salinas  california production facility and the addition of the frescala foods business that added  amortization expense during  and  in the company anticipates further increases in depreciation and amortization in future periods as additional equipment is purchased and placed in service  and goodwill expense increases with the acquisition of the nate s polenta business in december see liquidity  capital resources  and business acquisitions  page 
net interest expense of  was recognized in compared to net interest expense of  in and  in the decrease compared with was associated with additional cash generated by the increased profit level  which reduced loan balances  reduction in interest rate premium over prime by the company s lender  and reductions in prime rate 
the decline  in spite of higher overall interest rates  resulted from the reduction of debt associated with increased profitability 
at year end the company had no bank debt and the net interest expense for the year included  of interest income 
liquidity  capital resources  and business acquisitions during the twelve months ended december    of cash was provided by the company s operations  compared to  provided in the decline in net income of  was offset by a  change in deferred tax assets leaving a net increase of  attributable to profit performance associated with operations  excluding the change in deferred tax assets 
a decrease in accounts payable was primarily responsible for reducing the  adjusted net income performance number to the  net increase in cash provided by operations 
the accounts payable balance included nearly  in accrued fixed asset expenditures associated with the significant plant expansion project completed in the accounts payable balance was  lower because of a much lower level of capital commitments at year end 
the improvement followed a improvement of over  most of which was contributed by an increased net cash income net income plus depreciation and amortization 
in december  the company obtained a  credit facility from a commercial lending institution 
this facility was renegotiated with another bank in july to avail the company of lower interest rates 
it was increased to  in march  to allow for a stock repurchase of  shares of common from clearwater fund iv llc for a total purchase price of  or per share  resulting in a reduction in shares outstanding 
in july  the facility was renewed for additional years with lower interest rates on the term notes and the receivables and inventory line  as well as no loan fees 
a term note for  was negotiated in march to assist with the funding of the frescala foods acquisition 
this note was repaid in full in september of the current credit facility  renegotiated in august  is at million  of which zero was outstanding at december  see note to the financial statements 
the new facility is priced at libor  plus basis points for a debt tangible net worth ratio of  with libor premiums increasing in basis point increments based on increased debt tangible net worth increments of 
a total of  in cash was used in in connection with the nate s polenta acquisition  including costs associated with the transaction compared with  in associated with the march acquisition of frescala foods  inc refer to following paragraph 
in addition   in cash was used to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements in  compared to  in approximately million of the capital expenditures were part of a million capital plan approved by the company s board of directors in october for the period of october through december the company made additional capital expenditures in of approximately million to expand production capability  improve packaging efficiency and maintain quality and upgrade utilities including boiler capacity and waste water treatment  as well as another 
million for a stuffed pizza calzone line 
all future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with a combination of cash flow from operations and use of the company s credit facility 
on march   the company purchased the operating assets and inventory of frescala foods  inc frescala  a san antonio  texas based fresh pasta and sauce producer with an emphasis on private label production 
the consideration to frescala consisted of  in cash plus fully vested options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the options have an approximate fair market value of  an exercise price of per share  and a three year expiration 
additionally  frescala owners received an earn out of  as of october  based upon frescala sales above a predetermined level 
funding for the transaction came from a new  two year term loan  since repaid  use of existing accounts receivable and inventory line  and cash flow from operations 
the total consideration of  plus related acquisition costs of  was allocated to identifiable fixed assets totaling  and inventories of  the balance of  which includes trademarks and recipes not specifically quantifiable  was charged to goodwill 
on december   the company purchased the nate s polenta business of south san francisco  california for a total consideration of  plus related acquisition costs of  approximately  was allocated to inventory 
the remaining  which included recipes  a licensing agreement  and customer list was charged to goodwill 
additionally  nate s former owners could receive an earn out of a maximum of  to be paid as of august  based upon nate s sales above a predetermined level 
management believes that the company s million credit facility and cash generated from operations will provide adequate funding to meet its needs for normal operations and capital purchases through deferred tax assets due to the prior history of losses  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was provided in and earlier years  as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that they would be realized 
as of december   however  the company had experienced three consecutive years of increasingly profitable operations 
accordingly  a portion of the valuation allowance totaling  has been reversed as of december   since the company believes it is more likely than not that this portion of deferred tax assets will be realized 
the remaining reserves were released in at year end the company had  in deferred tax assets on its books 
assuming the company remains profitable  it will relieve a substantial portion of the deferred tax asset during  as it expects to record book taxes close to the federal and state corporate rates 
expectations are to pay a much lesser amount of cash taxes see note to the financial statements 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing strategy targets sustainable growth 
its focus is on increasing sales through expansion of its club store and retail grocery business  increasing its distribution through the rapidly growing number of natural and organic food retailers  and the introduction of innovative new products designed to meet consumer needs 
after gaining over new club stores during and  expansion of the company s club store business continued in with the rollout of the company s products in costco s los angeles and san diego divisions with total warehouses 
the company s presence in costco was approximately stores at year end distribution of the company s products also continues to grow with the national expansion of sam s club 
monterey pasta s products are now found in approximately sam s club locations  an increase of approximately stores over during the company s retail grocery distribution increased significantly with the addition of over ralph s stores in california  stores of denver based king soopers  stores of norfolk  va based farm fresh  inc  smart and final stores throughout the western united states  as well as a third direct store delivery route in northern california 
it also acquired new stores with the march frescala acquisition  of which it retained at year end during the net retail store increase was approximately  with the addition of whole foods and wild oats stores  raley s  super targets  vons  furr s  and the balance  over  stores from an increased presence with a large private label customer  to whom the company formerly sold its branded product 
monterey pasta s products typically are made with no preservatives or artificial ingredients 
capitalizing on this strength  the company continues to pursue increased distribution through natural and organic food retailers  whose growth has exceeded in recent years 
the company estimates there are potential natural and organic retail grocery stores available  as potential markets for its products 
during the company continued its emphasis on bringing innovative new products to the market place with the introduction of refrigerated stuffed pizzas  calzones  pierogies  a tortilla soup  and a vodka sauce 
the refrigerated pizzas and calzones were introduced late in the third quarter with a guaranteed shelf life of days  and  to the company s knowledge  are the only extended shelf life refrigerated pizzas and calzones 
the pierogies  introduced in the first quarter of  are also the only extended shelf life refrigerated pierogy the company is aware of  have been accepted nationally at sam s club stores  and have regional distribution elsewhere 
these introductions are part of an ongoing effort to rapidly introduce new products in the refrigerated section which further the company s gourmet image 
business risks certain characteristics and dynamics of the company s business and of financial markets generally create risks to the company s long term success and to predictable quarterly results 
these risks include no assurance of continued profitability 
in the second quarter of  the company reported its first operating loss from continuing operations 
subsequent to that quarter the company incurred losses through the first quarter of  after which it regained profitability  which has continued for fifteen consecutive quarters 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its recent profitability in the long or short term 
liquidity need for additional capital 
management believes that its operations and existing bank lines of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements for normal operations and capital expenditures through  assuming that its existing bank lines can be extended when they expire in august of if the company s operations do not provide cash sufficient to fund its operations  and the company seeks outside financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  any future equity financing or convertible debt financing would cause the company s stockholders to incur dilution in net tangible book value per share of common stock 
hiring and retention of key personnel 
the success of the company depends on its ability to retain key executives  and to motivate and retain other key employees and officers 
the company has key man insurance policies in place  each in the face amount of  for its chief executive officer  r 
lance hewitt  and its chief financial officer  stephen l 
brinkman 
there can be no assurance that significant management turnover will not occur in the future 
impact of inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations through substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  energy  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
the company cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future  or their magnitude 
volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially since the initial public offering of the company s common stock in december such volatility may  in part  be attributable to the company s operating results or to changes in the direction of the company s expansion efforts 
in addition  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets or the food industry  natural disasters or other developments affecting the company or its competitors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies  including the company  for reasons sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
any shortfall in the company s net sales or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or the market could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter 
this could result in an even more immediate and significant adverse impact on the trading price of the company s common stock upon announcement of the shortfall or quarterly operating results 
risks inherent in food production 
the company faces all of the risks inherent in the production and distribution of refrigerated food products  including contamination  adulteration and spoilage  and the associated risks of product liability litigation and declines in the price of its stock which may be associated with even an isolated event 
the company has a modern production facility  employs what it believes is state of the art thermal processing  temperature controlled storage  haacp programs intended to insure food safety  and has obtained usda approval for its production plant 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s procedures will be adequate to prevent the occurrence of such events 
dependence on major customers 
during  two customers  costco and sam s club stores  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
the company currently sells its products to seven separate costco regions approximately stores which make purchasing decisions independently of one another 
these regions re evaluate  on a regular basis  the products carried in their stores 
there can be no assurance that these costco regions will continue to offer monterey pasta products in the future or continue to allocate monterey pasta the same amount of shelf space 
the company also supplies its products to approximately sam s club stores 
purchasing decisions are made at the company headquarters with input from the store level 
while the company is in the fourth year of its relationship with sam s  and this relationship is expected to continue  there can be no assurance that sam s club stores will continue to carry its products 
loss of either of these customers  costco or sam s club  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
seasonality and quarterly results 
the company s grocery and club store accounts are expected to experience seasonal fluctuations to some extent 
the company s business in general may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including but not limited to general economic trends  competition  marketing programs  and special or unusual events 
competition and dependence on common carriers 
the company s business continues to be dominated by several very large competitors  which have significantly greater resources than the company  such competitors can outspend the company and negatively affect the company s market share and results of operations 
the company also continues to be dependent on common carriers to distribute its products 
any disruption in its distribution system or increase in the costs thereof could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
marketing and sales risks 
the future success of the company s efforts will depend on a number of factors  including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their individual stores offering the company s products and whether allowances and other incentives will expand retail distribution 
expansion into new markets increases the risk of significant product returns resulting from the company s supply of slower selling items to its customers 
in addition  grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
should these channels choose to reduce or eliminate products  the company could experience a significant reduction in its product sales 
as indicated previously  the company remains dependent on the use of slotting allowances and other incentives to expand retail distribution 
in order to reduce risk  the company has significantly reduced expansion into new markets requiring such major expenditures
