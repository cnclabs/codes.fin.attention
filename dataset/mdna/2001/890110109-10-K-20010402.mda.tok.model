net interest income also benefited from an improved mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

additionally  the net interest margin has experienced downward pressure due to the competitive environment for loans and deposits in the markets in which the company competes 
the long term impact of these economic and competitive factors is likely to result in continued narrowing of net interest margins for the company  and the industry as a whole 
nevertheless  management feels that recent acquisitions have improved the company s competitive position as it relates to net interest margin by providing additional sources of lower cost core deposits and creating an improved balance sheet mix with less interest rate risk exposure 
changes in net interest income occur from a combination of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the rate of interest earned or paid on them

the provision for loan lease losses was million in   in  and million in the increase in is primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio 
although  recent industry trends as reported by the fdic indicate deterioration in asset quality for the commercial banking industry as a whole  the company s loan portfolio remains of generally high quality  as evidenced by the low level of nonperforming loans and declining trends in net charge offs 
nonperforming loans and leases were million at december   representing a modest percent of total loans and leases outstanding at year end 
nonperforming loans and leases at year end were million  also representing percent of total loans and leases 
net charge offs of  in represented percent of average loans during the period  compared to net charge offs of  in  representing percent of average loans and leases 
other income other income  excluding sales of securities  has increased steadily as a percentage of revenue net interest income  plus other income from percent in  to percent in  to percent in although net interest income remains the primary revenue source for the company  competitive  regulatory  and economic conditions have led management to target other income opportunities as an important driver of long term revenue growth 
management believes a continued focus on noninterest income will improve the company s ability to compete with non bank competitors  and reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in the general interest rate environment 
the success of this strategy is evident  as other income increased by percent in  percent in  and percent in other income of million for the year ended december   reflects an increase of million over a portion of the growth is attributable to the fact that other income of the mahopac national bank is included for the full year in  and only seven months in if income from the mahopac national bank were included for the full year in  the growth in would have been approximately million  or approximately percent

many of these products and services can be offered to customers of the bank of castile and the mahopac national bank  thereby expanding the customer base for these products 
the process of marketing these products throughout the tompkins organization was started in and is expected to continue in and beyond  creating continued opportunities for growth in noninterest income

the tompkins investment services division of tompkins trust company generates fee income through managing trust and investment relationships  managing estates  providing custody services  and managing employee benefits plans 
trust and investments services income of million in represents an percent increase over trust and investment services income grew by percent from to increased fee income is attributable to the continued growth in average assets managed by  or in the custody of  tompkins investment services 
income generated by tompkins investment services is largely based on the value of the assets managed by the division  which can be affected by general trends in the stock market  as well as the amount of new business generated 
total assets managed by  or in custody of  tompkins investment services had a market value of billion at december  and  compared to million at december  tompkins investment services remains important to future revenue growth of the company

fee income associated with card services increased percent in to million  following growth of percent in other income includes a  increase in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance  up from  in  and  in this income is exempt from taxes 
the corporate owned life insurance was purchased primarily in the third and fourth quarters of  and relates to life insurance provided to certain senior officers 
increases in the cash surrender value of the insurance are reflected as other operating income  and the related mortality expense is recognized as an other operating expense 
although income associated with the insurance policies is not included in interest income  increases in the cash surrender value produced a tax adjusted return of approximately percent in  and percent in the recent acquisitions of austin  hardie  wise  inc and ernest townsend sons  inc  effective january  will provide an additional source of noninterest income and enhance the company s ability to serve its customers with a full range of financial products and services

as of december   commercial leases represented percent of total leases  compared to percent at year end the reserve for loan lease losses management reviews the adequacy of the reserve for loan lease losses on a regular basis 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the reserve and the related provision include management s approach to granting new credit  the ongoing monitoring of existing credits by the internal loan review department  the growth and composition of the loan and lease portfolio  comments received during the course of independent examinations  current local economic conditions  past due and nonaccrual loan statistics  and a historical review of loan and lease loss experience 
based upon consideration of the above factors  management believes that the allowance for loan lease losses is adequate to provide for the risk of loss inherent in the current loan and lease portfolio 
management uses a model to measure some of these factors and the resulting quantitative analysis  combined with qualitative assessments  comprise the basis on which the adequacy of the reserve for loan lease losses is determined 
the reserve for loan lease losses increased by  from to the increase is a result of the provision for loan lease losses exceeding the net loan losses for the year

based upon management s review  the reserve is believed adequate to absorb probable losses in the portfolio 
the above allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may occur nor is it an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowances to absorb losses in any category

management uses a simulation model to assess the potential impact from various interest rate movements 
based upon the simulation analysis performed as of december   a basis point upward shift in interest rates over a one year time frame would result in a one year decline of approximately percent in net interest income  assuming management takes no action to address balance sheet mismatches 
the same simulation indicates that a basis point decline in interest rates over a one year period would increase net interest income by less than percent 
the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate movements  however  management feels that certain actions could be taken to offset some of the negative effects of unfavorable movements in interest rates 
although the analysis reflects some exposure to rising interest rates  management feels the exposure is not significant in relation to the earnings and capital strength of the company
