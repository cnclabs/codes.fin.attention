net interest income is the principal source of the company s earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
versus net interest income totaled million in compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from a million or increase in interest income on loans and investments largely due to four prime rate increases  totaling basis points  commencing in the fourth quarter of and continuing into the second quarter of interest expense increased by million or due to an increase in interest bearing deposits coupled with increases in the rates paid for those deposits 
the increase in the loan and investment portfolios  together with higher yields in these portfolios  was offset by increased interest bearing deposits earning higher rates  resulting in slightly improved net interest margins of in and in the net interest spread narrowed four basis points to for from in interest income increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by growth in the average loan portfolio of million or and growth in the average investment portfolio of million or 
interest income was also affected by an increase in the yield on average earning assets both loans and investments to in from in as a result of the four prime rate increases

the increase resulted primarily from a million or increase in interest income on loans primarily due to a million or increase in commercial and industrial loans 
interest expense increased by million or due to an increase in the level of other borrowings  which consisted primarily of million from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the increase in the loan portfolio  together with higher yields in this portfolio  resulted in an improved net interest margin of from for and  respectively 
the decrease in the securities portfolio from million at december  to million at december  was due to portfolio repositioning as interest rates moved upward 
this repositioning necessitated sales of lower yielding holdings during the latter part of the net interest spread increased four basis points to for from in interest income increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by growth in the average loan portfolio of million or while the company experienced a decrease in the yield on average loans to in from in the average securities portfolio increased by million or  while its yield rose basis points from in to in as a result of continued portfolio shifting to higher yielding issues 
interest expense increased by million to million at december  compared with million at december  the increase was primarily due to growth in average fhlb borrowings and other borrowings of million during the company viewed these funds as stable and a less costly source of funding than time deposits

impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

financial condition loan portfolio at december   total loans decreased by million or to million from million at december  the decrease was due to the million factoring receivables charge off in may  a million sale of sba loans in july and was offset by net loan fundings of approximately million 
at december   total loans were million  an increase of million or compared to total loans at december  total loans at december  were million

the primary lending focus of the company is to small and medium sized businesses in a wide variety of industries 
the company s commercial lending emphasis includes loans to wholesalers  manufacturers and business service companies 
a broad range of short and medium term commercial lending products are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable  purchases of equipment and machinery and business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements 
generally  the company s commercial loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt as reflected by cash flow projections 
commercial loans are generally secured by business assets  which may include accounts receivable and inventory  certificates of deposit  securities  real estate  guarantees or other collateral 
the company also generally obtains personal guarantees from the principals of the business 
working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short term assets  whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long term assets 
as a result  commercial loans involve additional complexities  variables and risks and require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans 
indigenous to individuals in the asian business community is the desire to own the building and land which houses their businesses 
accordingly  while a loan may be principally driven and classified by the type of business operated  real estate is frequently the primary source of collateral 
as of december   approximately million or of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio was secured by real estate 
the company continually monitors real estate value trends and takes into consideration changes in market trends in its underwriting standards 
commercial loans are generally for amounts between  and  and as of december   the average commercial loan amount was  as of december   the company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaled million or of the gross loan portfolio 
commercial mortgage loans 
in addition to commercial loans  the company makes commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property  which generally consists of developed real estate 
the company s commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on real estate  typically have variable rates and amortize over a to year period with balloon payments due at the end of five to seven years 
payments on loans secured by such properties are dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
accordingly  repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s historical cash flow  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals  environmental impact reports and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
as of december   the company had a commercial mortgage portfolio of million 
construction loans 
the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and non residential properties 
the substantial majority of the company s residential construction loans are for single family dwellings which are pre sold or are under earnest money contracts 
the company also originates loans to finance the construction of commercial properties such as multi family  office  industrial  warehouse and retail centers 
construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction  and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property  it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result of these uncertainties  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan 
if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion  there is no assurance that the company will be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan 
in addition  the company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminable period of time 
while the company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending  no assurance can be given that these procedures will prevent losses from the risks described above 
as of december   the company had a real estate construction portfolio of million  of which million was residential and million was commercial 
residential mortgage brokerage and lending 
the company uses its existing branch network to offer a complete line of single family residential mortgage products through third party mortgage companies 
the company specializes in mortgages that conform with government sponsored programs  such as those offered by the federal national mortgage association fnma 
the company solicits and receives a fee to process these residential mortgage loans  which are then underwritten and pre sold to third party mortgage companies 
the company does not fund or service these loans 
the volume of residential mortgage loans processed by the company and pre sold to third party mortgage companies in was million 
since the company does not fund these loans  there is no risk of nonpayment to the company 
the company also makes five to seven year balloon residential mortgage loans primarily secured by non owner occupied residential properties  which are retained in the company s residential mortgage portfolio 
at december   the company s residential mortgage portfolio totaled million 
in  the bank originated thirteen fnma loans and two portfolio loans totaling million 
government guaranteed small business lending 
the company has developed an expertise in several government guaranteed lending programs in order to provide credit enhancement to its commercial and industrial and mortgage portfolio 
as a preferred lender under the federally guaranteed sba lending program  the company s pre approved status allows it to quickly respond to customers needs 
under this program  the company originates and funds sba a and chapter loans qualifying for federal guarantees of to of principal and accrued interest 
depending upon prevailing market conditions  the company may sell the guaranteed portion of these loans into the secondary market with servicing retained 
the company specializes in sba loans to minority owned businesses 
over the last eight years  the company has originated over million in sba guaranteed loans 
as of december   the company had million in the retained portion of sba loans  approximately million of which was guaranteed by the sba 
for each of the last six years  the company has been the second largest sba loan originator in houston in terms of dollar volume and in was the third largest sba originator 
sba loan originations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
another source of government guaranteed lending is b i loans which are secured by the us department of agriculture and are available to borrowers in areas with a population of less than  the company also offers guaranteed loans through the occgf  which is sponsored by the government of taiwan 
these loans are for people of chinese decent or origin  who are not mainland chinese by birth and reside overseas 
as of december   the company s occgf portfolio totaled million 
trade finance 
since  the company has originated trade finance loans and letters of credit to facilitate export and import transactions for small and medium sized businesses 
in this capacity  the company has worked with the ex im bank  an agency of the us government which provides guarantees for trade finance loans 
in  the company was named small business bank of the year by the ex im bank  and it was the largest ex im bank producer in the state of texas 
trade finance credit facilities rely heavily on the quality of the business customer s accounts receivable and the ability to perform the underlying transaction which  if monitored and controlled properly  limits the financial risks to the company associated with this short term financing 
to mitigate the risk of nonpayment  the company generally obtains a governmental guaranty or credit insurance from a governmental agency such as the ex im bank 
at december   the company s aggregate trade finance portfolio commitments totaled approximately million 
the company offers a wide variety of loan products to retail customers through its branch network in houston and dallas 
loans to retail customers include residential mortgage loans  residential construction loans  automobile loans  lines of credit and other personal loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months depending on the nature of the collateral and the size of the loan 
the company selectively extends credit for the purpose of establishing long term relationships with its customers 
the company mitigates the risks inherent in lending by focusing on businesses and individuals with demonstrated payment history  historically favorable profitability trends and stable cash flows 
in addition to these primary sources of repayment  the company looks to tangible collateral and personal guarantees as secondary sources of repayment 
lending officers are provided with detailed underwriting policies covering all lending activities in which the company is engaged and that require all lenders to obtain appropriate approvals for the extension of credit 
the company also maintains documentation requirements and extensive credit quality assurance practices in order to identify credit portfolio weaknesses as early as possible so any exposures that are discovered may be reduced 
inherent in all lending is the risk of nonpayment 
the types of collateral required  the terms of the loans and the underwriting practices discussed under each category above are all designed to minimize the risk of nonpayment 
in addition  as further risk protection  the company rarely makes loans at its legal lending limit 
although the company s legal loan limit is million  the company generally does not make loans larger than million 
loans are approved by lending officers and the directors credit committee pursuant to a lending authorization schedule delegated by the directors credit committee which is based on each loan officer s credit experience and portfolio 
control systems and procedures are in place to ensure all loans are approved in accordance with credit policies 
the company s policies and procedures designed to minimize the risk of nonpayment with respect to outstanding loans are discussed under nonperforming assets 
at december   and  except for the concentrations in the convenience gasoline stations and grocery store industries and the concentration in the apartment building industry the company had gross loan concentrations greater than of capital in the following industries as of december  in thousands hotels motels    retail centers    restaurants    apartment buildings    convenience gasoline stations    grocery stores  the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial and industrial and real estate portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december  are summarized in the following table as of december  after one one through after year or five five less years years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     real estate mortgage residential    commercial   real estate construction residential     commercial     total     loans with a predetermined interest rate     loans with a floating interest rate     total     effective january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under sfas  as amended  a loan is considered impaired based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the implementation of sfas did not have a material adverse affect on the company s financial statements 
nonperforming assets the company believes that it has procedures in place to maintain a high quality loan portfolio 
these procedures include the approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors  review by an independent internal loan review department  quarterly review by an independent outside loan review company  approval from the directors credit committee for large credit relationships and loan documentation procedures 
the loan review department reports credit risk grade changes on a monthly basis to management and the board of directors 
the company performs monthly and quarterly concentration analyses based on industries  collateral types  business lines  large credit sizes and officer portfolio loads 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when  in the opinion of management  full payment of loan principal or interest is in doubt 
all loans past due days are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual are recorded as a reduction of principal as long as significant doubt exists as to collection of the principal 
otherwise  interest is recognized on a cash basis 
in addition to nonaccrual loans  the company evaluates on an ongoing basis additional loans which are potential problem loans as to risk exposure in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company updates appraisals on loans secured by real estate when loans are renewed  prior to foreclosure and at other times as necessary  particularly in problem loan situations 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the company records other real estate at fair value at the time of acquisition less estimated costs to sell 
versus nonperforming assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to improvements in asset quality

management has established an allowance for loan losses  which it believes  is adequate for estimated losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors  indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers the diversification by industry of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security and the evaluation of its loan portfolio by the independent third party loan review function 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible in whole or in part 
the company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
through the loan review process  the company maintains an internally classified loan list which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur  or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans which are in the process of being charged off 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the company maintains a separate watch list which further aids the company in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management establishes specific allowances for loans which management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or the delinquent status of specific loans 
management then considers the risk classification or delinquency status of the remaining portfolio and other factors  such as collateral value  portfolio composition  trends in economic conditions and the financial strength of borrowers 
the company then charges to operations a provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined by the foregoing methodology 
beginning in december  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide for banks and savings institutions  the company allocates the allowance for loan losses according to management s assessments of risk inherent in the portfolio 
for the years ended december   and  net loan charge offs were million  million and million  respectively

the ratios of net loan charge offs to average total loans outstanding for the same periods were  and  respectively 
during  the provision for loan losses increased by million to million as the company made additional provisions to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in addition  as part of the sale of afc  the bank retained approximately  of allowance for loan losses formerly allocated to afc which resulted in an increased allowance spread over fewer loans 
during  the provision for loan losses increased by million to million as the company made a million provision during the fourth quarter as a result of loan losses which occurred during the year 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million

these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings  and certain minimum levels of regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
included in the company s mortgage backed securities at years ended december   and  were million  million and million in agency issued collateral mortgage obligations 
as of the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of the mortgage backed securities held by the company had final maturities of more than ten years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
mortgage backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average life of this security will not be unduly shortened 
at december   approximately of the company s mortgage backed securities earn interest at floating rates and reprice within one year  and accordingly are less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase 
derivatives in the third quarter of  the company entered into two interest rate swaps in an effort to match the repricing of its liabilities with its assets 
the swaps each have a notional amount of million 
the company pays a floating interest rate of libor london interbank offered rate less basis points and receives a fixed rate of on each swap 
as of december   the swaps were in effect 
each swap matures in but is callable every six months 
no additional derivatives were entered into during deposits the company s lending and investing activities are funded principally by deposits  approximately of which were demand  savings and money market deposits at december  average noninterest bearing demand deposits at december  were million compared with million at year end  an increase of million or 
total deposits at december  were million  an increase of million or from million at december  average total deposits during increased by to million 
average total deposits during increased by to million from million in the increases during and resulted primarily from the effect of opening new deposit gathering branches  the sale of certificates of deposit in established branches  and relationship banking initiatives 
the company s ratios of average noninterest bearing demand deposits to average total deposits for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
as part of its effort to cross sell its products and services  the company actively solicits time deposits from existing customers 
in addition  the company receives time deposits from government municipalities and utility districts as well as from corporations seeking to place deposits in minority owned businesses  such as the company 
these time deposits typically renew at maturity and have provided a stable base of time deposits 
unlike other financial institutions  where large time deposits are often considered volatile  the company believes that based on its historical experience its large time deposits have core type characteristics 
it has been the company s experience that  generally  asian customers and customers near retirement age have a higher proportion of savings in time deposits than in other investment vehicles because of the security provided by fdic insurance 
in pricing its time deposits  the company seeks to be competitive but typically prices near the middle of a given market

the loans bear interest at the average rate of per annum until the fifth anniversary of the loans  at which time the loans may be repaid or the interest rate may be renegotiated 
other short term borrowings principally consist of us treasury tax note option accounts and have a maturity of days or less 
additionally  the company had several unused  unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling million at december   million at december  and million at december  the following table presents the categories of other borrowings by the company as of december  dollars in thousands fhlb short term loans on december   average during the year   maximum month end balance during the year    fhlb notes on december    average during the year    maximum month end balance during the year    other short term borrowings on december average during the year maximum month end balance during the year the weighted average rate paid on other borrowings as of december  was

the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
interest rate risk is managed by the asset and liability committee alco which is composed of directors and senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies and other factors 
the alco meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activities  commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the alco reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates  however  under current policies of the company s board of directors  management has been given some latitude to increase the company s interest rate sensitivity position within certain limits if  in management s judgment  it will enhance profitability 
as a result  changes in market interest rates may have a greater impact on the company s financial performance in the future than they have had historically 
the company manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the company has not entered into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  structured notes  caps  floors  financial options  financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk 
during  the company entered into two interest rate swaps 
the company pays a floating interest rate of libor less basis points and receives a fixed rate of on each swap 
each swap matures in but is callable every six months 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company at december  volumes subject to repricing within greater than days days days years years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities         total loans         federal funds sold and other temporary investments   total interest bearing assets         interest bearing liabilities demand  money market and savings deposits 
     time deposits        federal funds purchased other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities        period gap         cumulative gap        period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities the preceding table provides company management with repricing data within given time frames 
the purpose of this information is to assist management in the elements of pricing and of matching interest sensitive assets with interest sensitive liabilities within time frames 
the table indicates a positive gap on a cumulative basis for the three time periods covering the next days of million  million and million  respectively 
with this condition  the company is susceptible to a decrease in net interest income should market interest rates decrease 
the company is aware of this imbalance and has initiated strategies to lower the positive gap by emphasizing the origination of fixed rate loans while shortening the terms of fixed rate liability products 
gap reflects a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure  without accounting for alterations in the maturity or repricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
for example  the gap position reflects only the prepayment assumptions pertaining to the current rate environment 
assets tend to prepay more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates than during periods of rising interest rates 
because of this and other risk factors not contemplated by the gap position  an institution could have a matched gap position in the current rate environment and still have its net interest income exposed to increased rate risk 
the company s rate committee and the alco review the company s interest rate risk position on a weekly and monthly basis  respectively 
as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility  primarily in the prime lending rate 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the alco 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify  monitor  manage or exploit the risks 
the company applies an economic value of equity eve methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  eve is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk by measuring the change in the eve that would result from a theoretical instantaneous and sustained basis point shift in market interest rates 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in eve for parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates eve as a of change present value of in eve assets change dollars in in change eve rates thousands in eve ratio change bp  bp bp bp  bp the percentage change in eve as a result of a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  was 
the percentage change in eve as a result of a basis point increase in interest rates on december  was 
the company has attempted to narrow the bands of extremes in the investment portfolio s performance acknowledging that some earnings opportunities must be allowed to pass in the interest of minimizing extreme losses during periods of volatile interest rates 
during the third and fourth quarters of  increasing interest rates caused increased prepayment speeds in the company s mortgage backed securities as well as accelerating call activity in us government agency fixed income securities 
as a result of a shift in investment philosophy combined with calls and increased prepayments  management has been able to restructure the portfolio and reduce the negative convexity 
the company s eve is most directly affected by the convexity and duration of its investment portfolio 
the duration and negative convexity of the company s investment portfolio produce disproportionate effects on the value of the portfolio with changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the percentage of portfolio price appreciation or depreciation relative to a decrease or increase in interest rates 
the higher the negative convexity  the greater the decline in the value of a fixed income security as interest rates increase 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of long term  fixed income securities  the value of which would be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment 
management believes that the eve methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the eve method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institution s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  however  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the eve methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historical rate patterns which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or repricing will react identically to changes in rates 
in reality  the market value of certain types of financial instruments may adjust in anticipation of changes in market rates  while any adjustment in the valuation of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the eve methodology does not reflect the full impact of contractual restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from time deposits may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on the ability of adjustable rate loan clients to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the prime rate in effect for december  and december  was and  respectively 
management believes that in the short term the prime rate will continue to soften 
liquidity liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily by financing activities  which consist mainly of growth in time deposits  supplemented by available investment securities available for sale  other borrowings and earnings through operating activities 
although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities  the company does not generally rely on these external funding sources 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investments along with payments and maturities within the loan portfolio  have historically created an adequate liquidity position 
the company uses federal funds purchased and other borrowings as funding sources and in its management of interest rate risk 
federal funds purchased generally represent overnight borrowings 
other borrowings principally consist of us treasury tax note option accounts that have maturities of days or less and borrowings from the fhlb 
fhlb advances may be utilized from time to time as either a short term funding source or a longer term funding source 
fhlb advances can be particularly attractive as a longer term funding source to balance interest rate sensitivity and reduce interest rate risk 
the company is eligible for several borrowing programs through the fhlb 
the first  a short term borrowing program  requires delivery of eligible securities for collateral 
maturities under this program range from one to days 
at year end  the company had million in borrowings under this program which was repaid in september the company currently maintains some of its investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb of dallas 
under another borrowing program  long term borrowings are available to the company from the fhlb 
these borrowings have maturities greater than one year and are collateralized first by fhlb stock  second by the company s one to four family mortgage loans and third by the company s investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb 
borrowings secured by the company s one to four family mortgage loans are limited to of the loan value 
at december   the company had million in borrowings under this program of which million was repaid in march capital resources capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the occ 
both the federal reserve board and the occ have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards of the federal reserve board require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve board has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the occ that are substantially similar to the federal reserve board s guidelines 
also pursuant to fdicia  the occ has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of the occ s prompt corrective action regulations

shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or

new accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas 
the statement becomes effective for reporting periods beginning after june   and will not be applied retroactively 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
under the standard  all derivatives must be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the financial condition 
in addition  hedge accounting should only be provided for transactions that meet certain specified criteria 
the accounting for changes in fair value gains and losses of a derivative is dependent on the intended use of the derivative and its designation 
derivatives may be used to hedge exposure to change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a from commitment  referred to as a fair value hedge  hedge exposure to variable cash flow of forecasted transactions  referred to as cash flow hedge  or hedge foreign currency exposure
