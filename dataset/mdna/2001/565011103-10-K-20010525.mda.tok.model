revenue general 
our revenue consists of software revenue  services revenue and support revenue 
software revenue is generally recognized upon execution of a software licensing agreement and shipment of the software  provided the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements based on historical fair value experience 
we generate the majority of our software revenue from our direct sales force with lesser amounts coming through indirect sales channels such as complementary software vendors  consulting firms  systems integrators and resellers 
services revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the support period defined in the software license agreement 
when we provide services that are considered essential to the functionality of software products sold or if software sold requires significant production  modification or customization  we account for the software and services revenue in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  which requires us to use the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized based on labor hours incurred to date compared to total estimated labor hours for the contract 
total revenue increased in fiscal and decreased by in fiscal the increase in fiscal revenue primarily resulted from increased demand and market acceptance for our products and services  increased selling activities resulting from a larger and more effective sales force  increased average selling price asp for our software and  to a lesser extent  the acquisitions of talus and stg 
the decrease in total revenue in fiscal resulted primarily from fielding a smaller direct sales force and a decrease in asp during the first half of fiscal versus fiscal no individual customer accounted for or more of total revenue in fiscal  or software 
software revenue increased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal software revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in software revenue and software revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal were primarily due to increased demand and market acceptance for our software products  increased selling activities resulting from a larger and more effective sales force  increased asp and number of completed transactions  expanded and enhanced product offerings  and the acquisition of talus 
the number of our significant software license transactions was in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the average size of our significant software transactions increased to million in fiscal compared to million in both fiscal and significant transactions are those with a value of over  the number of software transactions of million or greater increased to in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decreases in software revenue and software revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal were primarily due to a smaller direct sales force and poor sales force productivity during the first half of  transitioning the sales force to a vertical market focus  decreased number of completed transactions  difficulties integrating products and operations from prior acquisitions  competition  year concerns delaying client buying decisions and market awareness of our execution problem experienced in the prior year 
services 
services revenue increased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in services revenue in fiscal was due to an increased number of software transactions and related implementations  an increased customer base desiring training  consulting and implementation services and the talus acquisition 
services revenue tends to track software license transactions in prior periods 
the decrease in service revenue in fiscal primarily resulted from the decrease in software revenue during fiscal and fiscal  a smaller services workforce and greater utilization of systems integrators to provide these services 
support 
support revenue increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in support revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in support revenue in fiscal and was due to the increase in the number of clients that have licensed our software products and entered into annual support arrangements 
support revenue tends to track software license transactions in prior periods 
in the past  we have experienced a high rate of renewed annual support contracts 
there can no assurance that this renewal rate will continue 
see forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results 
international revenue 
we market and sell our software and services internationally primarily in europe  asia  canada and latin america 
revenue outside of the united states was of total revenue  or million  in fiscal  decreasing from  or million  in fiscal and or million  in fiscal the increases in this revenue resulted from our efforts to expand our presence and selling efforts outside of the united states 
we believe increasing international revenue is critical to growth in both revenue and profitability and may lower our overall exposure to unfavorable economic conditions in specific regions 
operating expenses cost of software 
cost of software consists primarily of amortization of capitalized software development costs and royalty fees associated with third party software included in our software 
the following table sets forth amortization of capitalized software development costs and other costs of license fees for the three years in the period ended february  in thousands fiscal year ended february or amortization of capitalized software    percentage of software revenue other costs of software    percentage of sotfware revenue total cost of software    percentage of software revenue the increase in cost of software in fiscal was primarily a result of increases in royalties paid to third parties as a result of the mix of software sold and the increase in software revenue 
cost of software revenue was relatively unchanged in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of services and support 
cost of services and support includes primarily personnel and third party contractor costs 
cost of services and support as a percentage of related revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal cost of services and support increased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the increase in cost of services and support during fiscal was attributable to adding the personnel necessary to support the growth in revenue and installed customer base 
the decrease in cost of services and support during fiscal was attributable to the reduction of personnel associated with restructuring activities in fiscal and the overall decline in revenue in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  promotional events such as trade shows and technical conferences  advertising and public relations programs 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal sales and marketing expense increased  or million in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increasing the number of direct sales representatives and sales management to at february  compared to at february   or an increase of  and increasing the overall sales  marketing and business development employees to at february  compared to at february   or an increase of  increased sales commissions due to higher software revenue  and increases in promotional spending  advertising and public relations spending to rebrand and reposition our solutions in the marketplace 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in dollars in fiscal and remain the same or decrease as a percentage of total revenue as our revenue grows 
see forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was primarily a result of reductions in personnel associated with restructuring activities in fiscal and the decrease in total revenue 
product development 
product development expenses include expenses associated with the development of new software products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities 
such costs are primarily from personnel and third party contractors 
we record product development costs net of capitalized software development costs for products that have reached technological feasibility in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the following table sets forth product development costs for the three fiscal years ended february  in thousands fiscal year ended february or gross product development costs    percentage of total revenue less capitalized product development costs    percentage of total revenue product development costs  as reported    percentage of total revenue gross product development costs increased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million in fiscal net product development costs increased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the increases in fiscal were due to increasing the number of product development employees to at february  compared to at february   or an increase of increasing the number of product development contractors to at february  compared to approximately at february   or an increase of increased number of product development initiatives 
the decrease in product development expenses as a percentage of total revenue reflects our ability to leverage resources over a larger revenue base 
we expect to continue to expend significant resources on product development in future periods and invest similar amounts as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
see forward looking statements and factors that may effect future results 
the decrease in gross and net product development costs in fiscal was primarily a result of reductions in personnel associated with restructuring activities in fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our legal  finance  accounting  human resources and information systems functions 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million in fiscal and decreased  or million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is due to increased personnel to support our growth 
the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue reflects our ability to spread this expense over a larger revenue base 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily a result of reductions in personnel associated with restructuring activities in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
our acquisitions of talus and stg during fiscal year and certain previous acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from two to seven years 
details of our acquisitions are included in note acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions referenced above was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect to record approximately million of amortization expense in fiscal year purchased research and development and acquisition related expenses 
our acquisitions of talus and stg included the purchase of technology that has not yet been determined to be technologically feasible and has no alternative future use in its then current stage of development 
accordingly  the portion of the purchase price for talus and stg allocated to purchased research and development of million  in aggregate  was expensed immediately in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in fiscal  we acquired tyecin systems  inc  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  we recorded a non recurring charge of million for certain expenses related to the transaction  including accounting  legal and severance costs 
details of our acquisitions are included in note acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
restructuring expenses benefits 
during fiscal  we announced and implemented a restructuring plan intended to reduce costs and improve profitability 
the restructuring plan was required due to poor financial performance throughout fiscal that resulted from a variety of factors 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded charges of million in fiscal the components of the charge are as follows in thousands severance and related benefits  lease obligations and terminations  impairment of long lived assets  other total  during fiscal  we reduced our previously reported restructuring charge by million due to changes in estimates related to better than expected success in subleasing abandoned and excess office space which was offset in part by higher than expected severance costs 
as of february   all severance obligations related to the restructuring had been paid and the remaining lease obligations were million 
non cash stock compensation expense 
we recognized non cash stock compensation of million in fiscal primarily associated with stock options that were repriced in january and unvested stock options assumed in the talus acquisition 
these amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders equity and are amortized by charges to operations in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
repriced options in january  we repriced employee stock options  other than those held by executive officers or directors 
this resulted in approximately million options being repriced and the four year vesting period starting over 
under fin  repriced options are subject to variable plan accounting  which requires compensation cost or benefit to be recorded each period based on changes in the company s stock price until the repriced options are exercised  forfeited or expire 
this resulted in a charge of million in fiscal no adjustments were made upon initial application of fin for periods prior to july  the initial fair value used to measure the ongoing stock compensation charge or benefit was based on the closing price of our common stock on june  as of february   million repriced options were still outstanding with a remaining vesting period of approximately two years 
in future periods  we will record additional charges or benefits related to the repriced stock options still outstanding based on the change in our common stock price compared to the last reporting period 
if our stock price at the beginning and end of any reporting period is below  no charge or benefit will be recorded 
unvested stock options talus acquisition as part of the talus acquisition  we assumed all outstanding stock options  which were converted into our stock options 
options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were unvested at the acquisition date 
fin requires the acquiring company to measure the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed at the acquisition date in a purchase business combination and record a compensation charge over the remaining vesting period of those options to the extent those options remain outstanding 
this resulted in a charge of million during fiscal as of february   approximately  of these options remained unvested with remaining vesting periods up to years 
other income  net other income  net  includes interest income from cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest expense from borrowings  foreign currency exchange gains or losses and other gains or losses 
other income increased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these increases relate primarily to an increase in interest income due to higher investment levels in fiscal offset by higher interest expense  both as a result of the issuance of million of convertible debt during the quarter ended november  provision benefit from income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal despite our loss before income taxes  resulting in a negative effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate in fiscal differed from the u 
s statutory rate primarily due to non deductible goodwill and in process research and development along with non cash stock compensation expense that did not result in an income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes 
excluding the effect of amortization of intangibles  purchased research and development and non cash stock compensation expense  our effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal as of february   we had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal  state and foreign tax purposes of million  in aggregate 
these carryforwards expire in various years between and we recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowances against nols where it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize these future tax benefits 
net loss we reported a net loss of million  million and million for the period ending february or     respectively 
our fiscal year results include operations related to the acquisitions of talus solutions  inc and stg holdings  inc 
the increased net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the write off of purchased research and development and intangible amortization directly attributable to our acquisitions of talus and stg and charges for non cash stock compensation  offset by an increase in operating income  excluding these non cash items 
the decrease in net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to an increase in income from operations in fiscal  including a decrease in restructuring charge and acquisition related expenses recorded in fiscal without the impact of these non recurring items  and the related tax effect  we would have reported net income of million for the period ending february   a net loss of million and million for the period ending february   and february   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in aggregate increased million during fiscal to million as of february  working capital increased million to million at february  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and working capital was primarily the result of receiving million in net proceeds related to completing our million convertible debt offering during the third quarter of fiscal and receiving proceeds of million from stock option exercises during fiscal cash provided by used in operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from i revenue growth and increased profits from operations before non cash charges of approximately million  ii an increase in interest income of million  iii reduction in cash paid for restructuring costs of million offset by net increases in working capital to support our revenue growth 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  accounts receivable and deferred revenue increased million and million  respectively  in fiscal  while days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased to days as of february  versus days as of february  these increases reflect the impact of our revenue growth in fiscal cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
investing activities consist primarily of the sales and purchases of marketable securities  purchases of property and equipment and purchases and capitalization of software 
purchases of marketable securities  net of sales  was million in fiscal primarily as a result of investing the proceeds from our convertible debt offering 
total purchases of property  equipment and software  including capitalized software  were million in fiscal we expect this amount to increase in fiscal and as we support our growth and build out our new corporate headquarters space 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from our convertible debt offering in fiscal  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases and changes in our line of credit 
we had no balance outstanding under our line of credit at february  as of february   we had million in convertible subordinated debentures outstanding the notes 
the notes bear interest at per annum which is payable semi annually 
the notes mature in november and are convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
at any time on or after november   the company may redeem the notes in whole  or from time to time  in part  at our option 
redemption can be made on at least days notice if the trading price of our common stock for trading days in a period of consecutive days ending on the day prior to the mailing of notice of redemption exceeds of the conversion price of the notes 
the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of the principal amount  will be as follows redemption period redemption price november  through october  november  through october  november  through october  november  through maturity we have a one year committed unsecured revolving credit facility with a commercial bank for million 
the current agreement is scheduled to expire in september under its terms  we may request cash advances  letters of credit or both 
we may make borrowings under the facility for short term working capital purposes or for acquisitions 
acquisition related borrowings are limited to million per acquisition 
in december  we entered into a ten year lease agreement for a new headquarters facility in gaithersburg  md 
we expect to incur to million in capital expenditures for leasehold improvements and furniture for the new space 
we expect to move into our new headquarters space during the second calendar quarter of on january   we acquired stg 
we may be required to make additional contingent payments to the former stockholders of stg of up to million during fiscal if certain revenue based performance criteria are met during the month period ending october  the additional contingent payments  if any  would be payable in cash  or in limited circumstances  in common stock at our sole election 
we are actively pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in addition  we may make strategic investments in businesses and enter into joint ventures that complement our existing business 
any future acquisition or investment may result in a decrease to our liquidity and working capital to the extent we pay with cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  available borrowings under our credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations in future periods will satisfy our existing liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business as result of recent significant changes in our management  personnel and products  you may have difficulty evaluating our prospects based on our significant losses in recent fiscal years 
we experienced operational difficulties in fiscal and the first half of fiscal problems with our direct sales operation and intense competition  among other factors  contributed to net losses in fiscal and fiscal and a decline in revenue in fiscal since april  we hired a new executive management team  enhanced our supply chain optimization and emarketplace products and services  expanded the scope of our product and service offerings to include pricing and revenue optimization and improved our direct sales organization 
our ability to continue to achieve operational improvements and improve our financial performance will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following slower growth in the market for supply chain management  pricing revenue optimization and emarketplace solutions  weakening economic conditions  our ability to introduce new software products and services to respond to technological and client needs  our ability to manage our anticipated growth  our ability to hire  integrate and deploy our direct sales force effectively  our ability to expand our distribution capability through indirect sales channels  our ability to respond to competitive developments and pricing  and our dependence on our current executive officers and key employees 
if we fail to successfully address these risks and uncertainties  our business could be harmed and we could continue to incur significant losses 
we have experienced significant losses in recent fiscal years 
our future results will be adversely affected by several types of non cash charges 
if we do not achieve or maintain profitability in the future  our stock price may decline 
we have recently incurred significant losses  including net losses of million for the year ended february   million in fiscal and million in fiscal we will incur non cash charges in the future related to the amortization of intangible assets and non cash stock compensation expenses associated with our acquisition of talus 
we will also incur non cash charges related to the amortization of intangible assets relating to our acquisition of stg holdings inc in addition  we may incur non cash stock compensation charges related to our stock option repricing as discussed in more detail in the notes to the financial statements see note 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will grow or that we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability will be affected by the other risks and uncertainties described in this section 
our failure to achieve profitability could cause our stock price to decline  and our ability to finance our operations could be impaired 
our operating results fluctuate  and if we fail to meet the expectation of the investment community in any period  our stock price could decline significantly 
our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be indicative of future performance 
the factors that may cause fluctuations of our quarterly operating results include the following the size  timing and contractual terms of licenses and sales of our products and services  customer financial constraints and credit worthiness  the potentially long and unpredictable sales cycle for our products  technical difficulties in our software that could delay the introduction of new products or increase their costs  introductions of new products or new versions of existing products by us or our competitors  delay or deferral of customer purchases and implementations of our solutions due to weakening economic conditions  changes in prices or the pricing models for our products and services or those of our competitors  changes in the mix of our software services and support revenue  changes in the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  and changes in rules relating to revenue recognition or in interpretations of those rules 
due to fluctuations from quarter to quarter  our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
variations in the time it takes us to license our solutions may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the time it takes to license our solutions to prospective clients varies substantially  but typically ranges between four and twelve months 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenue to fluctuate widely from period to period 
because we typically recognize a substantial portion of our software revenue in the last month of a quarter  any delay in the license of our products could cause significant variations in our revenue from quarter to quarter 
furthermore  because our operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short term and we devote significant time and resources to prospective clients  these fluctuations could cause our operating results to suffer in some future periods 
the length of our sales cycle depends on a number of factors  including the following the complexities of the supply chain  pricing revenue and emarketplace problems our solutions address  the breadth of the solution required by the client  including the technical  organizational and geographic scope of the license  the evaluation and approval process employed by the client  the sales channel through which the solution is sold  and any other delays arising from factors beyond our control 
the size and scope of our contracts with clients are increasing  which may cause fluctuation in our operating results 
our clients and prospective clients are seeking to solve increasingly complex supply chain  pricing revenue and emarketplace problems 
further  we are focused on providing more comprehensive solutions for our clients  as opposed to only licensing software 
as the complexity of the problems our clients seek to solve increases  the size and scope of our contracts with clients increase 
as a result  our operating results could fluctuate due to the following factors the complexities of the contracting process of our clients  contractual terms may vary widely  which may result in differing methods of accounting for revenue from each contract  losses of  or delays in concluding larger contracts could have a proportionately greater effect on our revenue for a particular period  and the sales cycles related to larger contracts may be longer and subject to greater delays 
any of these factors could cause our revenue to decline or fluctuate significantly in any quarter and could cause a decline in our stock price 
we have experienced difficulties integrating acquisitions in the past and may experience problems with future acquisitions that could materially harm our business 
acquisitions involve the integration of companies that have previously operated independently 
in connection with any acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will effectively integrate employees  operations  products and systems  realize the expected benefits of the transaction  retain key employees  effectively develop and protect key technologies and proprietary know how  avoid conflicts with our clients that have commercial relationships or compete with the acquired company  avoid unanticipated operational difficulties or expenditures or both  and effectively operate our existing business lines  given the significant diversion of resources and management attention required to successfully integrate acquisitions  including the acquisition of talus in december we experienced significant difficulties with the integration of the products and operations of promira software  inc promira and tyecin  which we acquired in fiscal and respectively 
these difficulties included problems integrating the prior promira sales forces and the delayed releases of the in process technology acquired as part of the transaction 
in addition  as a result of the poor financial performance we experienced in fiscal  the technology acquired in conjunction with the tyecin acquisition was not integrated into our solutions and  therefore  revenue generated from this technology have been nominal 
similar difficulties with future acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may encounter problems effectively integrating talus 
on december   we completed the acquisition of talus  a privately held company that provides pricing and revenue optimization products and services 
this acquisition is substantially larger than all of our prior acquisitions  not all of which have been successful 
in addition to the risks described above in connection with acquisitions generally  the ultimate success of our acquisition of talus is dependent on factors which include the following our ability to complete the commercial releases of our pricing and revenue optimization solutions  our ability to protect and maintain talus intellectual property rights  our ability to successfully market and license the products talus has developed and is developing for commercial release  our ability to successfully integrate talus technologies  our ability to retain and motivate talus employees  market acceptance of the products talus has commercially developed to date  our ability to fulfill our strategic plan for the acquisition of talus by integrating our supply chain and emarketplace capabilities and products with talus pricing and revenue optimization products  market acceptance of epo solutions  our ability  together with talus  to cross sell products and services into our respective markets  and the outcome of disputes and litigation which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
our acquisition of talus will adversely affect our combined financial results 
we will incur substantial dilution to our earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the foreseeable future as a result of the talus acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we will amortize approximately million of deferred compensation related to unvested stock options over four years 
further  we will initially incur an annual amortization charge of approximately million related to goodwill and intangible assets 
we depend on sales of our supply chain management  pricing revenue optimization and emarketplace solutions  and our business will be materially and adversely affected if the market for our products does not continue to grow 
substantially all of our software revenue  service revenue and support revenue have arisen from  or are related directly to  our supply chain management  pricing revenue optimization and emarketplace solutions 
we expect to continue to be dependent upon these solutions in the future  and any factor adversely affecting the solutions or the markets for supply chain management  pricing revenue optimization and emarketplace solutions  in general  would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
while we believe the markets for supply chain management  pricing revenue optimization and emarketplace solutions will continue to expand  they may grow more slowly than in the past 
if the markets for our solutions do not grow as rapidly as we expect  revenue growth  operating margins or both could be adversely affected 
our markets are very competitive  and we may not be able to effectively compete 
the markets for our solutions are very competitive 
the intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased  and we expect it to increase in the future 
our current and potential competitors may make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
further  our current or prospective clients and partners may become competitors in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  lower gross margins  longer sales cycles and the loss of market share 
each of these developments could materially and adversely affect our growth and operating performance 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly more resources than we do and  therefore  we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them 
we directly compete with other application software vendors including adexa  inc to be acquired by freemarkets  inc  aspen technology  inc  the descartes systems group inc  i technologies  inc  logility  inc  micros systems  inc  pros revenue management  sabre  inc  synquest and yieldstar technology 
some emarketplace software companies that do not currently offer directly competitive products or solutions  such as ariba  inc and commerce one  may begin to compete directly with us 
in addition  some erp companies such as invensys plc which acquired baan company nv  nv edwards company  oracle corporation  peoplesoft  inc and sap ag have acquired or developed and are developing supply chain planning  pricing revenue optimization or emarketplace solutions 
some of our current and potential competitors  particularly the erp vendors  have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than us  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of clients 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and adversely affect our revenue growth and operating performance 
if the development of our products and services fails to keep pace with our industry s rapidly evolving technology  our future results may be materially and adversely affected 
the markets for supply chain management  pricing revenue optimization and emarketplace solutions are subject to rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications or capabilities that meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace  meet changing client requirements  comply with changing industry standards  achieve market acceptance  integrate third party software effectively  and respond to competitive offerings 
our product development and testing efforts have required  and are expected to continue to require  substantial investments 
we may not possess sufficient resources to continue to make the necessary investments in technology 
in addition  we may not successfully identify new software opportunities or develop and bring new software to market in a timely and efficient manner 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced software in a timely manner  we may lose existing clients and fail to attract new clients  which may adversely affect our performance 
defects in our software or problems in the implementation of our software could lead to claims for damages by our clients  loss of revenue or delays in the market acceptance of our solutions 
our software solutions are complex and are frequently integrated with a wide variety of third party software 
we may license solutions that contain undetected errors or failures when new solutions are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we may also be unable to meet client expectations in implementing our solutions 
these problems may result in claims for damages suffered by our clients  a loss of  or delays in  the market acceptance of our solutions  client dissatisfaction and potentially lost revenue during the period required to correct these errors 
we are dependent on third party software that we incorporate into and include with our products and solutions and impaired relations with these third parties  defects in third party software or the inability to enhance their software over time could harm our business 
we incorporate and include third party software into and with our products and solutions 
we are likely to incorporate and include additional third party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we utilize 
it may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the software capabilities 
furthermore  it may be difficult for us to replace any third party software if a vendor seeks to terminate our license to the software or ability to license the software to others 
any impairment in our relationship with these third parties could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are substantially dependent on third parties to integrate our software with other software products and platforms 
we depend on companies such as extricity  inc recently acquired by peregrine systems  inc  vignette corporation  and webmethods  inc 
to integrate our software with software and platforms developed by third parties 
if these companies are unable to develop or maintain software that effectively integrates our software and is free from errors  our ability to license our products and provide solutions could be impaired 
further  we rely on these companies to maintain relationships with the companies that provide the external software that is vital to the functioning of our products and solutions 
the loss of any company that we use to integrate our software products could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our efforts to develop relationships with vendors such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others to implement and promote our software products may fail 
we are developing  maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors  such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others  that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions 
we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
we may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively 
our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of the organizations with whom we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products 
the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have only recently entered into contracts with governmental agencies 
these contracts often involve long purchase cycles and competitive procurement processes 
we have recently begun providing our solutions to government agencies and expect that a significant portion of our future revenue may be derived from government agency clients 
obtaining government contracts may involve long purchase cycles  competitive bidding  qualification requirements  performance bond requirements  delays in funding  budgetary constraints and extensive specification development and price negotiations 
in order to facilitate doing business with the federal government  we have submitted a schedule of prices for our products and services to the general services administration 
we are permitted to update our schedule of prices only on an annual basis 
each government agency maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among agencies 
government agencies also often retain a significant portion of fees payable upon completion of a project and collection of such fees may be delayed for several months 
accordingly  our revenue could decline as a result of these government procurement processes 
in addition  it is possible that  in the future  some of our government contracts may be fixed price contracts which may prevent us from recovering costs incurred in excess of our budgeted costs 
fixed price contracts may require us to estimate the total project cost based on preliminary projections of the project s requirements 
the financial viability of any given project depends in large part on our ability to estimate such costs accurately and complete the project on a timely basis 
in the event our actual costs exceed the fixed contract cost  we will not be able to recover the excess costs 
if we fail to properly anticipate costs on fixed price contracts  our profit margins will decrease 
some government contracts are also subject to termination or renegotiation at the convenience of the government  which could result in a large decline in revenue in any given quarter 
multi year contracts are contingent on overall budget approval by congress and may be terminated due to lack of funds 
increased sales through indirect channels may adversely affect our operating performance 
even if our marketing efforts through indirect channels are successful and result in increased sales  our average selling prices and operating margins could be adversely affected because of the lower unit prices that we receive when selling through indirect channels 
if we fail to effectively expand our sales organization  our ability to grow will be limited 
our continuing efforts to expand our sales organization will require significant resources 
new sales personnel will require training and may take a long time to achieve full productivity 
further  the competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and there is no assurance that we can attract and retain qualified sales people at levels sufficient to support our growth 
any failure to adequately sell and support our products could limit our growth and adversely affect our performance 
the limited ability of legal protections to safeguard our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to compete effectively 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and  although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  we expect software piracy to be a problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
our products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
the number of intellectual property claims in our industry may increase as the number of competing products grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
in recent years  there has been a tendency by software companies to file substantially increasing numbers of patent applications  including those for business methods and processes 
we have no way of knowing what patent applications third parties have filed until the application is filed or until a patent is issued 
patent applications are often published within months of filing but it can take as long as three years or more for a patent to be granted after an application has been filed 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to address  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
our international operations pose risks for our business and financial condition 
we currently conduct operations in a number of countries around the world 
these operations require significant management attention and financial resources and subject us to risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer collection cycles  foreign currency risk  legal uncertainties regarding liability  ownership and protection of intellectual property  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  potentially adverse tax consequences  and economic and political instability 
any of the above factors could adversely affect the success of our international operations 
one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we lose our key personnel  the success and growth of our business may suffer 
our success depends significantly on the continued service of our executive officers 
we do not have fixed term employment agreements with any of our executive officers  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on our executive officers 
the loss of services of any of our officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
the failure to hire and retain qualified personnel would harm our business 
we believe that our success also will depend significantly on our ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain additional highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  marketing and services personnel 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate profitably 
in addition  the cost of hiring and retaining skilled employees is high  and this reduces our profitability 
failure to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
an important component of our employee compensation is stock options 
a decline in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  as it has in the past 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management team and there is no assurance the team will work together effectively 
commencing in the first quarter of fiscal  we have completely changed our senior management team 
gregory j 
owens  our chief executive officer  joined us in april with one exception  all of our other present executive officers joined us after mr 
owens 
our success depends on the ability of our management team to work together effectively 
our business  revenue and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected if our senior management team does not manage our company effectively or if we are unable to retain our senior management 
expenses arising from our stock option repricing have had and may have in the future a material adverse impact on performance 
in response to the poor performance of our stock price between may and january  we offered to reprice employee stock options  other than those held by our executive officers or directors  effective january   to bolster employee retention 
the effect of this repricing resulted in options to acquire approximately million shares being repriced and the four year vesting period starting over 
the recently adopted fasb interpretation no 
of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  requires us to record compensation expense or benefit associated with the change in the market price of these options 
the increase in our common stock market price since the fasb mandated measurement date of july  resulted in a non cash stock compensation expense of million being recorded for the year ended february  this non cash stock compensation expense caused what would otherwise have been reported as net loss for the year ended of million  or per basic and diluted share  to be reported as a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share 
in each future quarter  we will record the additional expense or benefit related to the repriced stock options still outstanding  to the extent that our stock price is greater than  based on the change in our common stock price as compared to the measurement date 
as a result  the repricing may continue to have a material adverse impact on reported financial results and could therefore negatively affect our stock price 
we may be subject to future liability claims  and our company s and products reputation may suffer 
many of our implementations involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
any failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into agreements with software vendors  consulting firms  resellers and others whereby they market our solutions 
if these vendors fail to meet their clients expectations or cause failures in their clients systems  the reputation of our company and products could be materially and adversely affected even if our software products perform in accordance with their functional specifications 
risks related to our industry lack of growth or decline in internet usage or electronic marketplaces could be detrimental to our future operating results 
the growth of the internet has increased demand for supply chain management  pricing revenue optimization and emarketplace solutions  as well as created markets for new and enhanced product offerings 
therefore  our future sales and profits are substantially dependent upon the internet as a viable medium for electronic marketplaces 
the internet may not succeed in becoming a viable marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  concerns that may develop among businesses and consumers about accessibility  security  reliability  cost  ease of use and quality of service  increased taxation and governmental regulation  or changes in  or insufficient availability of  communications services to support the internet  resulting in slower internet user response times 
the occurrence of any of these factors could require us to modify our technology and our business strategy 
any such modifications could require us to expend significant amounts of resources 
in the event that the internet does not become and remain a viable commercial marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
new laws or regulations affecting the internet  electronic marketplaces or commerce in general could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our growth 
congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have adopted and are considering legislation affecting the use of the internet  including laws relating to the use of the internet for commerce and distribution 
the adoption or interpretation of laws regulating the internet  or of existing laws governing such things as consumer protection  libel  property rights and personal privacy  could hamper the growth of the internet and its use as a communications and commercial medium 
if this occurs  companies may decide not to use our products or services  and our business  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
the viability of electronic marketplaces is uncertain 
electronic marketplaces that allow collaboration over the internet among trading partners are relatively new and unproven 
there can be no assurance that trading partners will adopt electronic marketplaces as a method of doing business 
trading partners may fail to participate in electronic marketplaces for a variety of reasons  including concerns about the confidentiality of information provided electronically to electronic marketplaces  the inability of technological advances to keep pace with the volume of information processed by electronic marketplaces  and regulatory issues  including antitrust issues that may arise when trading partners collaborate through electronic marketplaces 
any of these factors could limit the growth of electronic marketplaces as an accepted means of commerce 
slower growth or the abandonment of the electronic marketplace concept in one or more industries could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to the notes our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
in november  we completed a convertible debt offering of million in subordinated convertible notes 
our indebtedness could have important consequences for investors 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of capital to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
neither the terms of our credit facility nor the terms of these notes fully prohibit us from doing so 
if a significant amount of new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we may have insufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
we will be required to generate cash sufficient to pay all amounts due on the notes and to conduct our business operations 
we have net losses  and we may not be able to cover our anticipated debt service obligations 
this may materially hinder our ability to make principal and interest payments on the notes 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
risks related to the sale of our common stock resales of significant amounts of our common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of talus may cause our stock price to decline 
in connection with the acquisition of talus  we issued approximately million new shares of our common stock 
of these shares  a total of approximately million shares were delivered to manugistics exchange agent for direct transfer to the former talus stockholders and approximately million shares were delivered to state street bank and trust company  as escrow agent  to secure potential indemnification claims of manugistics 
to the extent that the escrowed shares are not subject to indemnification claims  the escrowed shares will be released  subject to existing claims  in two installments  on october  and july  of the million shares delivered to the exchange agent  approximately million shares were freely tradable upon completion of the acquisition 
the remaining approximately million shares are subject to share transfer restrictions and will become available for sale in three stages in accordance with the terms of the share transfer restriction agreements signed by certain principals of talus solutions  inc the first release date was january   at which time approximately million shares were released 
the balance of these shares will be released  in accordance with the terms of the share transfer restriction agreements  on may  and october  in addition  at closing  a total of approximately million shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding talus stock options and warrants which were assumed by manugistics 
options to purchase a total of approximately  shares were exercisable at the time of completion of the acquisition 
in addition  a total of approximately  of these shares were subject to share transfer restrictions which expired january  sales of significant amounts of our common stock by our executive officers may cause our stock price to decline 
certain of our executive officers have entered into pre established trading plans pursuant to which they sold a total of approximately  shares of our common stock in january and approximately  shares in april they are scheduled to sell up to approximately  shares per quarter after each of the first  second and third quarters of fiscal pursuant to these trading plans 
the quarterly sales will continue until the trading plans are modified or terminated 
certain of our other executive officers and directors are considering establishing similar plans to sell shares on a quarterly basis 
the sale of these shares may cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our charter and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover even if beneficial to stockholders 
our charter and our bylaws  in conjunction with delaware law  contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders 
for example  our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors and allow our board of directors to expand its size and fill any vacancies without stockholder approval 
in addition  our bylaws require a two thirds vote of stockholders to remove a director from office 
furthermore  our board has the authority to issue preferred stock and to designate the voting rights  dividend rate and privileges of the preferred stock all of which may be greater than the rights of common stockholders 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  weakening economic conditions  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the market for epo  scm  pro and emarketplace solutions  changes in the performance and or market valuations of our current and potential competitors and the software industry in general  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of our technology in  or compatibility of our technology with  such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products  additions or departures of key personnel  our sales of additional equity securities  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  the nasdaq national market and the equity markets for software companies in particular  have recently experienced extraordinary price and volume volatility and a significant cumulative decline in recent months 
such volatility and decline have adversely affected the stock prices for many companies irrespective of or disproportionately to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely further affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance

international sales are usually made by our foreign subsidiaries in local currencies and the expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are also denominated in local currencies 
interest rate risk 
our marketable securities and certain cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  commercial paper  money market instruments  bank time deposits and taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities and national  state and local government agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars
