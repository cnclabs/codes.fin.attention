item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or verbal forward looking statements  including statements contained in this and other company filings with the securities and exchange commission and in our press releases and reports to shareholders 
all statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to sales growth and earnings per share growth or statements about future operating results  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
the forward looking statements are and will be based on management s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance 
risk factors the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the company s forward looking statements consumer preferences  impact of economic conditions the retail fashion accessories and apparel business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by fashion and season 
in addition  certain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise offered by the company  including  among others  business conditions  unemployment  interest rates  energy costs  taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer preference and economic conditions may differ or change from time to time in each market in which the company operates and directly impact the company s net sales and profitability 
merchandise inventory  replenishment and distribution fluctuations in the retail fashion accessories and apparel business especially affect the inventory owned by fashion accessories and apparel retailers  since merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and sometimes before fashion trends are identified or evidenced by customer purchases 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the retail business requires the company to carry a significant amount of inventory  especially prior to peak selling seasons when the company and other retailers generally build up their inventory levels 
the company must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  the company is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and uses markdowns to clear merchandise 
markdowns may be used if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference or lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently marked price 
such markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent of the markdowns and amount of inventory affected 
because the company does not carry much replenishment inventory in its stores  much of the inventory is maintained in the company s distribution centers in hoffman estates  illinois  birmingham  england  zurich  switzerland and vienna  austria 
the company s distribution functions for all of its stores located in the united states and canada are handled from its single distribution center in hoffman estates  illinois 
any significant interruption in the operation of this distribution center  due to natural disaster or otherwise  would have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
store operations and expansion the company s stores are distinctively designed for customer identification  ease of shopping and a wide variety of selection of merchandise which emphasize style  quality and good value 
the range of merchandise displayed in each store varies significantly depending on the selling season and the size and location of the store 
store hours are dictated by mall operators and the stores are typically open from am to am  monday through saturday  and  where permitted by law  from noon to pm on sunday 
approximately of sales are made in cash  with the balance made by credit cards 
the company s continued success depends  in part  upon its ability to increase sales at existing store locations  to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s growth will result in enhanced profitability or that it will continue at the same rate in future years 
international expansion the company continued to expand internationally in fiscal it is faced with competition in european markets from established regional and national chains 
if international expansion is not successful  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s ability to grow successfully in the continental european market will depend in part on determining a sustainable profit formula to build customer loyalty and gain market share in the especially challenging retail environments of france and germany 
certain financial information about international operations is set forth in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein 
impact of the european monetary union the european union is comprised of fifteen member states  eleven of which adopted a common currency  the euro  effective january  from that date until january   the transition period  the national currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro 
ultimately  the euro will be the sole currency within the european union and one organization  the european central bank  will be responsible for setting european monetary policy 
while some believe that the change will bring a higher level of competition within europe and a greater sense of economic stability within that region  there is no certainty that the company s activity in this region will necessarily realize any benefits as a result of such changes 
the company is currently reviewing the impact of the euro conversion on its management information systems  accounting systems  vendor payments and human resources 
at this time  the company cannot estimate the costs it will incur in connection with the euro conversion or determine whether the euro conversion is likely to have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
suppliers the company purchases merchandise from approximately suppliers located domestically and overseas 
no supplier accounted for more than of the company s fiscal purchases 
of the company s merchandise purchases during fiscal  approximately of all units purchased for the fashion accessory stores in north america representing approximately of total cost were purchased domestically while the remaining of all units of cost were purchased from outside the united states 
approximately of the company s total merchandise units purchased for the fashion accessory stores in north america representing of cost were from china  including hong kong  with the remainder coming from other countries 
any event causing a sudden disruption of imports from china or other foreign countries  including political instability or the imposition of additional import restrictions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
substantially all of the company s foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars 
the company cannot predict whether any of the countries in which its products currently are manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the us and other foreign governments  including the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or quotas  embargoes  and customs restrictions  against merchandise could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to the company and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company pursues a diversified global sourcing strategy that includes relationships with vendors in approximately countries 
these sourcing operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or other trade disruptions 
seasonal business the company s business follows a seasonal pattern  peaking during the christmas  easter and back to school periods 
during fiscal  these periods accounted for approximately of the company s annual sales 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal fluctuations also affect inventory levels  since the company usually orders merchandise in advance of peak selling periods 
the company must carry a significant amount of inventory in anticipation of these selling periods 
competition the company s business is highly competitive 
the company competes with national and local department stores  specialty and discount store chains  independent retail stores and internet and catalog businesses that market similar lines of merchandise 
some competitors have more resources than the company 
given the large number of companies in the retail industry  the company cannot estimate the number of its competitors 
depth of selection in sizes  colors and styles of merchandise  merchandise procurement and pricing  ability to anticipate fashion trends and consumer preferences  inventory control  reputation  quality of merchandise  store design and location  and customer service are all important factors in competing successfully in the retail industry 
the performance of the company in recent years has increased the amount of imitation by other retailers 
such imitation has made and will continue to make the retail environment in which the company operates more competitive 
in addition  the company s competitive position depends upon a number of factors relating to consumer spending  including future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment  business conditions  interest rates  energy costs and taxation 
a decline in consumer spending on fashion accessories and apparel could have a material adverse effect on the company s net sales and profitability 
dependence on mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space substantially all of the company s stores are located in regional shopping malls 
the company s sales are derived  in part  from the high volume of traffic in those malls 
the company benefits from the ability of the mall s anchor tenants  generally movie theaters and large department stores  and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in its stores vicinity and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations for pre teens and teenagers 
sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area  competition from non mall retailers  other malls where the company does not have stores and the closing of anchor tenants in a particular mall 
in addition  a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target customers  pre teens and teenagers  could affect the company s business 
in recent months  it appears there has been a noticeable decline in mall traffic 
the company believes this has resulted in a decrease in the number of transactions per store  although such decrease has been offset by an increase in average transaction size 
since the company is primarily a mall based chain  the company s future growth is significantly dependent on its ability to open new stores in desirable locations 
there is no assurance as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available 
dependence on key personnel the company s success and ability to properly manage its growth depends to a significant extent both upon the performance of its current senior management team and its ability to attract  hire  motivate and retain additional qualified management personnel in the future 
the inability to recruit and retain such additional personnel  or the loss of service of any of the company s current executive officers  could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the foregoing factors are not exclusive 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors 
further  management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on the company s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements
