item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of ncric group should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial and operating data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
references to ncric mean ncric group and its subsidiaries  including their predecessors 
general the financial statements and data presented in the form k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  unless otherwise noted 
gaap differs from statutory accounting practices used by regulatory authorities in their oversight responsibilities of insurance companies 
on january  ncric group acquired all the outstanding shares of healthcare consulting  inc  the interests of hci ventures  llc  and the assets of employee benefits services  inc the acquisition was recorded as a purchase 
the results of operations for the years ended december  and include the results of the acquired businesses for those periods 
under terms of the purchase agreement  an additional purchase payment could be paid in cash if the acquired business achieved an earnings target in  the target was met and the resulting additional purchase payment of million was accrued as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of ncric s net income and equity between gaap and statutory accounting bases 
discussed below are selected key financial concepts premium income 
gross premiums written represent the amounts billed to policyholders 
gross premiums written are reduced by premiums ceded to reinsurers and renewal credits in determining net premiums written 
premiums ceded to reinsurers represent the cost to ncric of reducing ncric s exposure to medical professional liability losses by transferring agreed upon insurance risks to reinsurers through a reinsurance contract or treaty 
renewal credits are reductions in premium billings to renewing policyholders 
net premiums written are adjusted by any amount which has been billed but not yet earned during the period in arriving at earned premiums 
for several large groups of policyholders  ncric has insurance programs where the premiums are retrospectively determined based on losses during the period 
premiums billed under retrospective programs are recorded as premiums written  while premium refunds accrued under retrospective programs are recorded as unearned premiums 
under retrospective programs  premiums earned are premiums written reduced by premium refunds accrued 
prior to  ncric s policies were written with a january renewal date 
beginning in and continuing in and  ncric began staggering policy renewal dates throughout the year  which results in a one time effect when the policy is staggered 
written premiums are increased during the periods when policies are being re issued  returning to the previous level in the subsequent period 
in accordance with gaap  premiums are earned ratably over the terms of ncric s policies  so this change in renewal dates has no effect on premiums earned for any period 
unearned premiums represent premiums billed but not yet fully earned at the end of the reporting period 
premiums receivable represent annual billed premiums and retrospective program premiums which have not yet been collected 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
loss and lae reserves are estimates of future payments for reported and unreported claims and related expenses of adjudicating claims with respect to insured events that have occurred 
the change in these reserves from year to year is reflected as an increase or decrease to ncric s loss and loss adjustment expenses 
medical professional liability loss and lae reserves are established based on an estimate of these future payments as reflected in ncric s past experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns 
other factors that modify past experience are also considered in setting reserves  including court decisions  economic conditions  current trends in losses  and inflation 
reserving for medical professional liability claims continues to be a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgements 
although ncric follows a practice of conservatively estimating its future payments relating to losses incurred  there can be no assurance that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
ncric  in consultation with its independent actuaries  utilizes several methods in order to estimate loss and lae reserves by projecting ultimate losses 
by utilizing and comparing the results of these methods  ncric is better able to analyze loss data and establish an appropriate reserve 
the loss and lae reserves are established by management on a monthly basis and reviewed periodically by ncric s independent actuaries 
the independent actuarial review includes an evaluation of the appropriateness of methods used and changes in methodology if needed  as well as a reflection of updated experience 
the inherent uncertainty in establishing reserves is relatively greater for companies writing long tail casualty business  like ncric 
due to the extended nature of the claim resolution process of professional liability claims  established reserve estimates may be adversely impacted by judicial expansion of liability standards  expansive interpretations of contracts  inflation associated with medical claims  and the propensity of individuals to file claims 
because of the existence of these uncertainties  ncric has historically taken a conservative posture in establishing reserves 
ncric refines reserve estimates as experience develops and additional claims are reported or existing claims are closed  adjustments to losses reserved in prior periods are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made 
losses and lae reserve liabilities as stated on the balance sheet are reported gross before recovery from reinsurers for the portion of the claims covered under the reinsurance program 
losses and lae expenses as stated on the income statement are reported net of reinsurance recoveries 
reinsurance 
ncric manages its exposure to individual claim losses  annual aggregate losses  and lae through its reinsurance program 
reinsurance is a customary practice in the industry 
it allows ncric to obtain indemnification against a specified portion of losses associated with insurance policies it has underwritten by entering into a reinsurance agreement with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
ncric pays or cedes part of its policyholder premium to reinsurers 
the reinsurers in return agree to reimburse ncric for a specified portion of any claims covered under the reinsurance contract 
while reinsurance arrangements are designed to limit losses from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses  reinsurance does not relieve ncric of liability to its insureds 
under ncric s current primary reinsurance contract  the premium ceded to the reinsurers is based on a fixed rate applied to policy premium for that coverage layer 
during the year  estimated payments are made to the reinsurers  and a final adjustment is made at the end of year to reflect actual premium earned in accordance with the treaty 
for and prior  in accordance with one of ncric s primary reinsurance contracts  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers is swing rated or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated cession program is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
a deposit premium is paid by ncric during the initial policy year 
an additional liability  retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties is recorded by ncric to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
like loss and lae reserves  adjustments to prior year ceded premiums payable to the reinsurers are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made 
the swing rated reinsurance premiums are recorded in a manner consistent with the recording of ncric s loss reserves 
ncric s practice for accounting for the liability for retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties has been to record the current year swing rated reinsurance premium at management s best estimate of the ultimate liability  which has generally been the maximum rate payable under terms of the treaty 
due to the long tail nature of the medical malpractice insurance business  it takes several years for the losses for any given report year to fully develop 
since the ultimate liability for reinsurance premiums depends on the ultimate losses  among other things  it is several years after the initial reinsurance premium accrual before the amount becomes known 
during the intervening periods  reevaluations are made and adjustments to the accrued retrospective premiums are made as considered appropriate by management 
ncric has historically ceded to its reinsurers over of its exposure to individual losses in excess of million  known as excess layer coverage 
excess layer premiums are recorded as current year reinsurance ceded costs 
under the excess layer treaties  effective january   ncric cedes of its risks and premiums related to these coverage layers 
recent industry performance 
ncric s results of operations have historically been influenced by factors affecting the medical professional liability industry in general 
the operating results of the us medical professional liability industry have been subject to significant variations over time due to competition  general economic conditions  judicial trends and fluctuations in interest rates 
according to the january  best s review preview published by am best company  was a transition year for the medical malpractice market with prices beginning to firm as the result of poor underwriting experience and increasing reinsurance costs 
in this article best predicts trends to include sustained price increases and worsening claims severity 
ncric actively monitors these industry trends and considers them in relation to ncric s circumstances when setting rates or establishing reserves 
accounting literature 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
 summarizing certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
based on a review of the ncric s revenue recognition polices  the impact of adopting sab no 
is not material to its financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
sfas  as amended by sfas  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  ncric will adopt sfas  as amended  on january  ncric believes that the impact of adopting sfas will not be material to its financial statements 
consolidated net income years ended december   and year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  improvement both in net underwriting results and in practice management results contributed to the increased earnings 
practice management results in included improvement due to lower legal fees relating to the litigation brought by the ncric physicians organization and settled in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the primary contributor to the decreased earnings was increased reinsurance costs of million due to the reduction in favorable prior years development under the swing rated treaty 
largely offsetting this increased cost was an increase of million in gross earned premiums after renewal credits and a reduction of million in incurred losses and lae 
net premiums earned following is a summary of ncric s net premiums earned year ended december  in thousands gross premiums written    change in unearned premiums    gross premiums earned before renewal credits    reinsurance premiums ceded related to current year    prior year    total reinsurance premiums ceded    net premiums earned before renewal credits    renewal credits    net premiums earned    net premiums written after renewal credits    year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross premiums written increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  starting in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  ncric began staggering policy renewal dates 
premiums written for the year ended december  did not include any additional premiums from the staggering of renewal dates  while premiums written for the year ended december  included approximately million due to the re writing of policies 
there is a one time effect when the policy renewal is staggered which increases premiums written in the period in which the renewal date is moved  premiums written will  all else being equal  return to the previous level in the subsequent period 
while the staggering of the renewal dates affects premiums written  earned premiums are not affected for either period 
the gross premiums written include premiums for retrospectively rated programs of million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase includes million for the billing of previously accrued premium for one of the risk sharing programs further discussed below 
gross premiums written adjusted for the staggering of renewal dates and retrospective program premiums increased by million  or 
this increase was due primarily to net new business written in  increasing the number of policyholders by  offset partially by a change in the mix of business in new policies written 
gross premiums written on excess layer coverage increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  late in the second quarter it was determined that one of ncric s retrospective programs would not be renewed at the september renewal 
under this type of risk sharing program  physicians are underwritten directly by ncric and pay lower individual premiums than if not part of the risk sharing program 
at the end of the policy year covered by the premium  a review of the actual loss experience of the physician group is completed 
should the group s loss experience be unfavorable  ncric will require additional premium payments from the sponsoring hospital to offset the unfavorable losses 
this hospital sponsored program  which terminated september included physicians insured directly with ncric and accounted for approximately million in annualized premium 
the majority of the physicians formerly in this terminated program have renewed their coverage and initiated participation in other hospital sponsored programs where ncric provides the insurance coverage 
based on the actual accumulated loss experience of the terminated program through september   ncric has billed the hospital sponsor million under terms of the contract based on actual loss experience through the termination date 
because this bill was not paid when due  ncric has initiated legal proceedings to collect 
ncric will use all means legally available to collect the amount it is due 
ncric believes that resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time

reinsurance premiums ceded increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  reinsurance premiums are affected by current year premiums payable to the reinsurers  as well as the retrospective adjustments to accruals for prior year premiums 
the increase was the result of a decrease in the credit from prior years premiums for favorable loss experience under the swing rated reinsurance treaty 
current year reinsurance premiums ceded decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to the reduced reinsurance premium rate on the primary layer premium as the result of the reinsurance treaty effective january  offset by increased gross premium reinsured 
the reinsurance premium due for excess layer coverage at million for the year was unchanged 
the liability retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties decreased to million at december  from million at december  reinsurance premiums related to prior years under the swing rated treaty were reduced by million in and million in due to favorable loss development of reinsured losses compared to prior estimates by ncric

the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development in the though loss years 
renewal credits increased  to million for the year ended december  reflecting an increase in premiums on policies eligible for the renewal credit 
in general  renewal credits apply to policies written in the district of columbia and maryland

net premiums earned before renewal credits at million for the year ended december  are flat compared to the year ended december  net premiums earned after renewal credits decreased by  less than  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease reflects the million lower reinsurance ceded favorable prior year development in compared to largely offset by the increase in gross earned premiums 
while insurance in force continues to follow the historic pattern of insuring risks concentrated in the district of columbia  there has been notable growth in net earned premium in virginia  largely as the result of sales by agents and to clients of the practice management services segment

loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and combined ratio results the expense for incurred losses and lae for each year net of reinsurance can be summarized as follows 
all loss expense amounts incurred are reported net of reinsurance amounts recoverable 
year ended december  in thousands incurred losses and lae related to current year losses    prior years development    total incurred for the year    traditionally  property and casualty insurer results are judged using ratios of losses and underwriting expenses compared to net premiums earned 
following is a summary of these ratios for each period 
year ended december  loss and lae ratio current year losses prior year losses total loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio year ended december  compared to year ended december  total incurred loss and lae expense of million for year ended december  represented a decrease of  or  compared to million incurred for the year ended december  the total incurred losses are broken into two components incurred losses related to the current coverage year and development on prior coverage year losses 
current year incurred losses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the number of new claims reported in was greater than in  however  the frequency  the number of claims reported per full time equivalent insureds  was flat in relative to the level 
an increase in severity was first noted in and continued through the increase in severity reflects the growing size of plaintiff verdicts and settlements 
ncric s escalation in this adverse claims trend is similar to the conditions faced by many medical professional liability insurance carriers across the nation 
while an increase in severity would tend to cause loss ratios to deteriorate  ncric s reinsurance program for losses in excess of  provides protection against the increase in severity of losses 
ncric experienced favorable development on estimated losses for prior year s claims for both years 
prior year development results from the re estimation and settlement of individual losses not covered by reinsurance  which are generally losses under  the favorable loss development related to prior years claims was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the total loss and lae ratio was reduced by points for the year ended december  and points for the year ended december   as a result of this favorable development 
the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development for the   and loss years  partially offset by adverse development in the loss year  whereas  the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development for the through loss years 
the reduced level of favorable development in compared to reflects the increase in severity noted above 
the underwriting expense ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is reflective of the increase in underwriting expenses in addition to the increase in reinsurance ceded premiums previously described 
underwriting expenses increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  see underwriting expenses 
the combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in incurred losses resulted in a combined ratio at the second lowest level for the through period 
the statutory combined ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this decrease reflects the same premium and loss level factors noted previously 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total incurred loss and lae expense of million for year ended december  represented a decrease of million  or  compared to million incurred for the year ended december  the total incurred losses are broken into two components incurred losses related to the current coverage year and development on prior coverage year losses

loss and loss adjustment expenses liability the loss and lae reserve liabilities for unpaid claims as of each period are as follows year ended december  in thousands liability for losses   loss adjustment expenses   reinsurance recoverable on losses   losses in the medical professional liability industry can take up to eight to ten years  or occasionally more  to fully settle 
actual amounts are not due from the reinsurers until ncric settles a claim 
ncric believes that all of its reinsurance recoverables are collectible 
see business reinsurance for a discussion on the reinsurance program 
underwriting expenses salaries and benefits accounted for approximately of other underwriting expenses  with professional fees  including legal  auditing and director s fees  accounting for approximately another of the underwriting expenditures 
premium taxes and commissions related to the change in unearned premiums are treated as deferred acquisition costs 
guaranty fund assessments are based on industry loss experience in the jurisdictions where ncric does business  which is not entirely predictable 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  underwriting expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses primarily stems from the increase in new business  particularly agent produced business  through increases in commission and other underwriting costs  plus increased premium taxes and an increase in the allowance for uncollectible premium receivables 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  underwriting expenses decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense was due primarily to a decrease in premium taxes related to the reduction in the premium tax rate  a decrease in guaranty fund assessments and a decrease in directors fees and salaries as a result of the reorganization 
practice management and related expenses practice management and related expenses consist primarily of expenses  such as salaries  general office expenses  and goodwill amortization related to ncric mso operations of the businesses acquired january  the management services organization was established in to provide physicians with a variety of administrative support and other services but did not have substantive operations until year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to general increases in operating expenses  principally compensation  related to supporting a growing base of business

year ended december  compared to year ended december  other expenses decreased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary component of the decrease was a reduction of legal expenses incurred in connection with litigation brought by ncric physicians organization and settled in as well as the non recurrence of interest expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses due to meeting the various requirements associated with having common stock traded in the public market and the expense of the stock grants made in september  under the stock award plan 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other expenses decreased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the change resulted primarily from the decrease in expenses in connection with the reorganization and in expenses for national capital insurance brokerage related to a consulting contract that was transferred to ncric  inc during offset largely by an increase of  in legal fees incurred in connection with litigation brought by ncric physicians organization  interest on acquisition debt and parent company expenses for directors fees 
the litigation was settled in with terms including a guarantee of a minimum payment to the ncric physicians organization of  per month for months

year ended december  federal income tax at statutory rates tax exempt income dividends received goodwill amortization reorganization costs other  net income tax at effective rates ncric s net deferred tax assets are created by temporary differences that will result in tax benefits in future years due to the differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
the primary difference is the requirement to discount or reduce loss reserves for tax purposes because of their long term nature 
year ended december  deferred federal income tax asset   year ended december  compared to year ended december  tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the federal corporate income tax rate of was reduced to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  due to tax exempt income and nontaxable dividends received  partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization 
the effective rate of for the year ended december  was lower than the effective rate primarily due to a lower level of tax exempt income in the increase in the provision for income tax is reflective of the increased income before tax combined with the increase in the effective tax rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the federal corporate income tax rate of was reduced to an effective tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  due to tax exempt income and nontaxable dividends received  partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization 
the effective rate was for the year ended december   higher than the effective rate primarily due to reorganization costs 
the decrease in federal income tax is reflective of the decreased income before tax for the period combined with the reduction in the effective tax rate 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources ncric group financial condition and capital resources 
ncric group is a stock holding company whose operations and assets primarily consist of its ownership of ncric  inc and ncric mso  inc 
as a result of the reorganization  ncric group has greater access to the capital markets 
this allows ncric group to assist its subsidiaries in their efforts to compete effectively and create long term growth 
as a part of this strategy  ncric group may seek to take advantage of acquisition opportunities and alternative financing 
on january   sequoia national bank approved a loan to ncric group in the amount of  at annual interest rate of prime of a percentage point to finance the acquisition of healthcare consulting  inc and hci ventures  llc and the assets of employee benefits services  inc on july   the loan was repaid from the proceeds of the issuance of common stock 
liquidity 
liquidity is a measure of an entity s ability to secure enough cash to meet its contractual obligations and operating needs 
ncric group s cash flow from operations will consist of dividends from subsidiaries  if declared and paid  and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries  offset by fees paid to ncric  inc  for management services and other expenses 
ncric group intends to rely primarily on this cash flow from ncric  inc and ncric mso  inc 
to pay dividends on its common stock  if any 
the amount of the future cash flow available to ncric group may be influenced by a variety of factors  including ncric  inc s financial results and regulation by the district of columbia department of insurance and securities regulation 
the payment of dividends to ncric group by ncric  inc is subject to limitations imposed by the district of columbia holding company system act of under the dc holding company act  ncric  inc must seek prior approval from the commissioner to pay any dividend which  combined with other dividends made within the preceding months  exceeds the lesser of a of the surplus at the end of the prior year or b the prior year s net income excluding realized capital gains 
net income  excluding realized capital gains  for the years preceding the current year is carried forward for purposes of the calculation to the extent not paid in dividends 
the law also requires that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
the district of columbia permits the payment of dividends only out of unassigned statutory surplus 
using these criteria  as of december   ncric  inc would have had available approximately million of unassigned statutory surplus available for dividends 
subsidiaries of ncric group liquidity 
the primary sources of ncric subsidiaries liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  practice management and financial services fees  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay claims  lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes  and to purchase investments 
ncric subsidiaries had negative cash flows from operations for the year ended december  and positive cash flows from operations for the years ended december  and cash used in operating activities of ncric subsidiaries was  in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in the million of decreased cash flow in compared to results primarily from a million increase in payments for losses and lae  an increase of million in income taxes paid  an increase of million for reinsurance under the swing rated treaty  a million dividend to the parent company  and a decrease in interest income of  partially offset by an increase in premiums collected of  the million of increased cash flow in compared to results primarily from million of additional premiums collected  an increase of million in receipts from reinsurers  a decrease of  in income and premium taxes paid  and net cash inflows of  from the operations of the practice management and financial services companies acquired january   partially offset by a million increase in payments for losses and lae 
because of the long term nature of both payment of claims and the settlement of swing rated reinsurance premiums due to the reinsurers  cash from operations for a medical professional liability insurer like ncric  inc can vary substantially from year to year 
comprehensive income was a gain of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in comprehensive income results from the increase in unrealized investment gains  net of deferred income taxes  added to the increase in net income

effects of inflation and interest rate changes the primary effect of inflation on ncric is in estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for medical professional liability claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement 
the rate of inflation for malpractice claim settlements can substantially exceed the general rate of inflation 
the actual effect of inflation on ncric s results cannot be conclusively known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  ncric believes that loss and lae reserve levels and ncric s ratemaking process adequately incorporates the effects of inflation 
interest rate changes expose ncric to a market risk on its investment portfolio 
this market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices  such as interest rates 
in general  the market value of ncric s fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuation in interest rates 
in addition  ncric s net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes on monies re invested from maturing securities and investments of positive cash flow from operating activities 
federal income tax matters for tax years prior to the stock offering  ncric filed a consolidated united states federal income tax return with its parent and subsidiaries 
for tax years after the stock offering  ncric does not file as part of a consolidated united states federal income tax return with ncric  a mutual holding company or ncric holdings because ncric  a mutual holding company and ncric holdings own directly and indirectly less than of the outstanding shares of ncric group 
tax years  and are open but not currently under audit 
in the internal revenue service approved a change in accounting method for ncric relative to the timing of revenue recognition for tax purposes 
regulatory matters naic statutory accounting codification 
the national association of insurance commissioners or naic is an association of the insurance regulators of all states and the district of columbia 
the naic has codified the statutory accounting practices  which are the accounting rules and guidelines prescribed by the state insurance regulators 
the project was intended to re examine current statutory accounting practices and to ensure uniform accounting treatment from a regulatory standpoint 
many of the changes to statutory accounting are based on generally accepted accounting principles with modifications that emphasize the concept of conservatism and solvency inherent in statutory accounting 
the accounting mandated by the codification applies commencing january  statutory accounting changes resulting from this codification will not have an effect on the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  which have been included in this document and filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the effect on ncric s statutory surplus on january  is an increase of million 
this increase is mainly due to the effect of accounting changes related to the implementation of deferred taxes and the removal of the excess of statutory reserves over statement reserves penalty  offset by charges to surplus for overdue receivables 
naic iris ratios 
the naic insurance regulatory information system iris  is an early warning system that is primarily intended to be utilized by the state and district of columbia insurance department regulators to assist in their review and oversight of the financial condition and results of operations of insurance companies operating in their respective jurisdictions 
iris is a ratio analysis system that is administered by the naic 
the naic provides the state and district of columbia insurance department regulators with ratio reports for each insurer within their jurisdiction based on standardized annual financial statements submitted by the insurers 
iris identifies ratios to be analyzed for a property casualty insurer  and specifies a range of values for each of these ratios 
the ratios address various aspects of each insurer s financial condition and stability including profitability  liquidity  reserve adequacy and overall analytical ratios 
departure from the usual range of a ratio may require the submission of an explanation to the state or district of columbia insurance regulator 
departure from the usual range on four or more ratios may lead to increased regulatory oversight 
for  ncric s subsidiary cml was outside the usual range on three ratios 
the ratio results were impacted by two primary factors the rapid increase in new premium written in cml and the increase in severity of losses  particularly the adverse development in losses of one prior year 
in the opinion of management  because of the reasons for the ratio results for the current year  the ratio results are not indicative of operational problems in this subsidiary 
for and  another subsidiary  ncric  inc  was outside the usual range for two ratios as the result of fluctuations in reinsurance ceded premiums under the swing rated reinsurance program 
naic risk based capital 
the naic has established a methodology for assessing the adequacy of each insurer s capital position based on the level of statutory surplus and an evaluation of the risks in the insurer s product mix and investment portfolio profile 
this risk based capital or rbc formula is designed to allow state and district of columbia insurance regulators to identify potentially under capitalized companies 
for property casualty insurers  the formula takes into account risks related to the insurer s assets including risks related to its investment portfolio and the insurer s liabilities including risks related to the adverse development of coverages underwritten 
the rbc rules provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the insurer s total adjusted capital to the authorized control level of rbc 
for all periods presented  ncric s and commonwealth medical liability insurance company s total adjusted capital levels were significantly in excess of the authorized control level of rbc 
as a result  the rbc requirements are not expected to have an impact upon ncric s operations 
following is a presentation of the total adjusted capital for ncric and commonwealth medical liability insurance company compared to the authorized control level of rbc authorized control level risk based capital total adjusted capital ncric cml ncric cml in millions december  forward looking information a number of statements made by ncric in this document are forward looking statements which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause ncric s actual results to be materially different from historical results or from the results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include o general economic conditions including changes in interest rates and the performance of financial markets  o ncric  inc s concentration in a single line of business primarily in the district of columbia  o the impact of managed healthcare  o uncertainties inherent in the estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance  o price competition  o uncertainties associated with expanding business in new market areas  including uncertainties associated with claims adjudication experience  o regulatory changes  o ratings assigned by am best  o the availability of bank financing and reinsurance  o the mutual holding company structure  and o uncertainties associated with ncric group s acquisition strategy 
other factors not currently anticipated by management may also materially and adversely affect ncric group s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ncric s investment portfolio is exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and equity price risk 
market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices 
at december   fixed maturity securities comprised of total investments at market value 
us government and tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity securities 
equity securities  consisting primarily of preferred stock  account for the remainder of the investment portfolio 
ncric has classified its investments as available for sale 
because of the high percentage of fixed maturity securities  interest rate risk represents the highest exposure ncric has on its investment portfolio 
in general  the market value of ncric s fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuation in interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the fair value of ncric s investment portfolio will generally decline resulting in decreases in ncric s stockholders equity 
conversely  during periods of falling interest rates  the fair value of ncric s investment portfolio will generally increase resulting in increases in ncric s stockholders equity 
in addition  ncric s net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes on monies reinvested from maturing securities and investments of positive cash flow from operating activities 
generally  the longer the duration of the security  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
to control the adverse effects of the changes in interest rates  ncric s investment portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of intermediate term  investment grade securities 
ncric s investment policy also provides that all security purchases be limited to rated securities or unrated securities approved by management on the recommendation of ncric s investment advisor 
approximately of the portfolio is treasury or agency related or rated aaa  the highest rating for a security 
one common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity securities is effective duration 
effective duration utilizes maturities  yields  and call terms to calculate an average age of expected cash flows 
the following table shows the estimated fair value of ncric s fixed maturity portfolio based on fluctuations in the market interest rates 
projected market value yield change bp market yield in thousands current yield current yield is as of december  the actual impact of the market interest rate changes on the securities may differ from those shown in the sensitivity analysis above
