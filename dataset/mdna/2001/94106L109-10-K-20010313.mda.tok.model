strategic plan in  the company announced a strategic plan focused on emphasizing internal growth and focusing on our core business north american solid waste management services 
as part of the plan  beginning in and throughout  we sold the majority of our international operations and certain of our non integrated north american solid waste operations 
we also have sold  or announced agreements to sell  almost all of our non core operations  including our low level and other radioactive waste operations  organic residuals operations  industrial services  hazardous waste treatment operations and independent power plants 
the proceeds from the sales were used to repay a portion of our debt 
also as part of the plan  the company began other initiatives in that continued through  including linking our information technology initiatives to our business strategy and rolling out new software systems that give our employees better tools to do their jobs  developing standard policies and procedures  and increasing the flow of communication in an effort to streamline our business and bring more discipline and accountability  but at the same time maintain decentralized operations  so that authority is still close to the customer  and restoring a capital expenditure policy that focuses on the internal growth rather than the external growth of the company 
accounting charges and adjustments during  the company initiated a comprehensive internal review of its accounting records  systems  processes and controls at the direction of its board of directors 
as discussed below  and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company experienced significant difficulty in the integration and conversion of information and accounting systems subsequent to the company  then known as usa waste services  inc  completing its merger with wm holdings  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests the wm holdings merger 
as a result of these systems and process issues  and other issues raised during the accounting review  certain charges and adjustments were recorded  as discussed below 
the review was completed in time such that the company was able to record related adjustments in its financial statements for the quarter ended september  the amounts recorded by the company as a result of the review had a material effect on its financial statements for the year ended december  the following is a summary of charges attributable to this review which were recorded for the quarter ended september  in millions held for sale adjustments increase to allowance for doubtful accounts and other accounts receivable adjustments asset impairments excluding held for sale adjustments insurance reserves and other insurance adjustments legal  severance and consulting accruals merger and acquisition related costs other charges and adjustments  including account reconciliations loss contract reserve adjustments increase in environmental liabilities other impact of charges before income tax benefit  income tax benefit after tax charges  the charges described above  which include both recurring and nonrecurring items that have been aggregated for this presentation  are reflected in the company s financial statements for the year ended december   as follows in millions allowance for doubtful accounts insurance legal  and other reserves severance merger and held for accounts and other and acquisition sale receivable other asset insurance consulting related adjustments adjustments impairments adjustments accruals costs operating revenues costs and expenses operating exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below general and administrative depreciation and amortization merger and acquisition related costs asset impairments and unusual items loss from operations other income expense interest expense interest income minority interest other income expense loss before income taxes and extraordinary items benefit from income taxes net loss total other includes charges recurring and and non recurring adjustments items operating revenues costs and expenses operating exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below general and administrative depreciation and amortization merger and acquisition related costs asset impairments and unusual items loss from operations  other income expense interest expense interest income minority interest other income expense loss before income taxes and extraordinary items  benefit from income taxes net loss  subsequent to the completion of the accounting review  and in conjunction with the process of preparing its monthly financial statements during the fourth quarter of and its financial statements at december   additional adjustments attributable to the reconciliation of intercompany accounts  cash  accounts receivable  fixed assets  accounts payable and certain other accounts were recorded 
the company recorded significant adjustments in the third and fourth quarters of  certain of which affect periods prior to these quarters 
accordingly  the company  after consultation with its independent public accountants  concluded that its internal controls for the preparation of interim financial information did not provide an adequate basis for its independent public accountants to complete reviews of the quarterly financial data for the quarters during the company believes that certain charges that were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of may relate to individual prior periods  however  the company does not have sufficient information to identify all specific charges attributable to prior periods 
if identification of all specific charges attributable to individual prior periods was possible  the company believes that the reported results of operations presented in note to the consolidated financial statements for the third and fourth quarters of would have been favorably impacted  and the reported results of operations for the first and second quarters of would have been adversely impacted 
the company concluded  based on its quantitative and qualitative analysis of available information  after consultation with its independent public accountants  that it did not have  nor was it able to obtain  sufficient information to conclude what amount of the charges relate to any individual prior year  although qualitative analysis indicates that these charges are principally related to accordingly  the company has concluded that these charges were appropriately reflected in the annual financial statements 
the company believes that the processes it used for the preparation of its quarterly interim financial statements have improved 
in addition  the company has committed substantial resources to mitigate the previously identified control weaknesses 
management believes these efforts have enabled the company to produce timely and reliable interim financial statements during see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for additional discussion

results of operations for the three years ended december  operating revenues operating revenues for were billion  compared with billion in and billion in the higher revenues in reflect acquisitions of solid waste businesses in north america 
the decrease in revenues in is primarily due to the divestitures of wm international and non solid waste operations during the year 
operating revenues by reportable segment in millions operating revenues 
performance graph 
nasw operating revenue mix in millions operating revenues 
performance graph 
nasw operating revenues increased in from primarily due to internal growth of comparable operations of or million from pricing increases and or million from volume increases 
during the first half of  the pricing in the recyclable materials markets favorably impacted overall pricing increases 
however  during the second half of the recyclable materials market experienced a significant downturn that offset the improvements experienced earlier in the year 
additionally  the company implemented a fuel surcharge in march to mitigate the significant increase in the cost of fuel 
excluding the impact of price increases in the commodity markets for recyclable materials  and the fuel surcharge that was implemented  there was a price increase of in compared to acquisitions of nasw businesses during and the full year effect of acquisitions that were completed in accounted for an increase in operating revenues of approximately million for  as compared to the primary offset to the increase in operating revenues was the divestiture of certain non integrated nasw operations 
however  the foreign currency fluctuations with the canadian dollar also negatively impacted operating revenues during nasw operating revenues in were lower than expected due to substantial difficulties in the integration of operations after the mergers with wm holdings on july  and eastern environmental services on december   including the information systems particularly the billing systems and related work flow 
in  the company experienced significant difficulty in the conversion from the wm holdings information systems to the systems currently in use  resulting in delays and errors  particularly with the billing systems  including delays in submitting bills to customers and errors in both computing and delivering bills 
staffing levels were insufficient to address customer complaints and disputes and did not support timely follow up with customers 
billing system issues initially became evident in the second quarter of as receivable aging levels rose 
at that time  management believed that the increase in receivables was a short term issue  receivables would return to historical levels once the billing system conversions were complete and there was not a significant collectability issue with its recorded receivables 
in connection with the accounting review  it was concluded that certain of these accounts had deteriorated to the point that they may be uncollectable  and therefore  a significant increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded in the third quarter of these events also contributed a higher than usual provision for uncollectable accounts in the fourth quarter of beginning in the third quarter of  resources dedicated to receivable collection efforts were increased on both a temporary and permanent basis and the billing systems began to stabilize 
in  the company was successful in collecting certain accounts that were reserved for in acquisitions of nasw business during and the full year effect of acquisitions which were completed in accounted for an increase in operating revenues of approximately million for  as compared to nasw operating revenues also increased from internal growth of comparable operations of for  as compared to the company believes that its internal revenue growth in was detrimentally affected by certain inflexibilities in its pricing strategy and the lack of responsiveness of that strategy to localized competitive conditions  resulting in lost customers and volumes 
offsetting the increase in operating revenues were divestitures of nasw businesses with revenues of approximately million  as well as other business factors that comprised the remaining differences  including the foreign currency fluctuations with the canadian dollar 
the operating revenues from the wm international operations increased from to by approximately 
this increase was primarily due to acquisitions of businesses  primarily in denmark and australia 
however  in  wm international operating revenue decreased as the company began selling its wm international operations on a country by country basis 
as of december   the company had certain operations in sweden  and also operated outside of north america in argentina and israel 
operating revenues for the non solid waste services decreased from to due to divestitures of several non core businesses 
non solid waste operating revenues are expected to decrease in because the company is actively marketing for sale the remaining non solid waste operations 
operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below operating costs and expenses decreased million or for  as compared to  and increased million or for  as compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  operating costs and expenses increased from in to in and were in from to  operating costs and expenses as a percentage of operating revenues fluctuated from period to period  primarily due to the effects of the company s integration plan adopted in connection with the wm holdings merger in july see operating revenues above 
in  soon after the merger with wm holdings  the company experienced reductions  both in amount and as a percentage of operating revenues  in its operating costs and expenses as a result of the reductions in employee headcount and the elimination of excess operating assets that were either sold or abandoned pursuant to the merger integration plan 
the company believes that the reductions in employee headcount and the disposition of excess operating assets resulted in short term cost efficiencies in in  the company continued the implementation of its merger integration plan 
however  due to the breadth and comprehensive nature of the changes the company attempted to implement in the first half of  the company was unable to sustain the effectiveness of the plan 
operating costs and expenses increased significantly as a percentage of revenues in second half of and throughout because the short term cost reductions experienced in could not be sustained in due to the operational difficulties encountered by the company 
however  in the second half of  the company started reviewing its procurement practices and started developing more standardized operating procedures and expects operating costs and expenses as a percentage of operating revenues to decrease in as part of its ongoing operations  the company reviews its liability requirements for remediation and other environmental matters based on an analysis of  among other things  the regulatory context surrounding landfills  site specific environmental issues and remaining airspace capacity in light of changes to operational efficiencies 
accordingly  revisions to remediation liability requirements may result in upward or downward adjustments to income from operations in any given period 
adjustments for final closure and post closure estimates are accounted for prospectively over the remaining capacity of the operating landfill 
the impact of revisions to remedial environmental and other similar liabilities resulted in reductions of operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues in the amount of and in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million or from to and increased million or from to as a percentage of operating revenues  the company s general and administrative expense was for  for and for as discussed above  the company believes it experienced short term cost reductions related to the elimination of duplicate corporate administrative functions from the merger with wm holdings in and the first half of however  in the second half of and into early  those cost reductions were substantially offset by the effect of difficulties encountered by the company in integrating the operations of wm holdings 
a major component of the increased costs was increased administrative costs in field operations to perform billing  collection and other administrative functions 
in  particularly the first half  the company incurred significant costs in professional accounting and process improvement consulting services related to process improvement initiatives and accounting assistance that began as part of the accounting review 
by the second half of  the company had stabilized its accounting systems and completed its process improvement initiatives  significantly reducing the ongoing need for these consulting services 
additionally  the company incurred significant consulting costs in related to the future implementation of new enterprise information systems  the need for which was identified as part of the company s strategic plan discussed above 
in  the company incurred approximately million related to professional accounting and process improvement consulting services and consulting services related to the future implementation of new enterprise information systems 
in  the company also incurred approximately million related to its efforts to divest operations  to improve its billing systems and verify its customer base  and for legal fees related to certain shareholder litigation and other sec matters 
as discussed in operating revenues above  the company was successful in collecting certain accounts that were reserved for in collection of those accounts favorably impacted the company s provision for bad debt in the company recorded provisions for bad debts of million and million in and  respectively 
the company also experienced permanent staffing increases at the corporate office in particularly in the area of information systems and corporate accounting and finance 
the company expects that advances in its information systems and business processes will result in better information for making operational and strategic decisions as well as permanent reductions in field administrative costs in future periods 
general and administrative expenses for included million in adjustments resulting from the accounting review  some of which are recurring in nature and should be expected in future periods 
these significant adjustments include an increase of million relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts and include million in costs for insurance adjustments  accounting  legal and other professional services 
these costs are primarily related to litigation and investigations conducted by the company in see discussion in operating revenues and operating costs and expenses above  of the company s substantial difficulties in integrating the operations of wm holdings subsequent to the wm holdings merger 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million or in  and increased million or in  as compared to as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization expense was in  in and in the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues in compared to is primarily due to the suspension of depreciation in on fixed assets related to certain operations which were held for sale and the depreciation and amortization expense that was recorded in related to operations classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of and divested in the depreciation suspension for for these held for sale operations prior to those operations being sold was million  or of operating revenues 
the depreciation suspended in for operations held for sale  which all occurred in the fourth quarter of  was million  or of operating revenues 
however  these decreases in depreciation and amortization expense were partially offset by increased landfill airspace amortization in due to an increase in disposal volumes at the company s landfills 
additionally  for  the company experienced higher airspace amortization expense as compared to the prior years  due to higher airspace amortization rates as a result of its more stringent set of criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining airspace expansions which was effective as of the third quarter of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in as compared to  after considering the suspension of depreciation for held for sale operations in  is primarily a result of the company s acquisition activity in and the full year impact of acquisitions in merger and acquisition related costs  asset impairments and unusual items in  and  the company had significant charges related to merger and acquisition related costs and asset impairments and unusual items 
in  these charges primarily related to the company s merger integration plans and related business reviews associated with the mergers with wm holdings and eastern environmental services 
the merger integration plans included significant employee severance costs  restructuring costs  transaction costs and changes in certain employee benefit programs  as well as charges for businesses to be sold and assets to be abandoned 
the business review included charges for losses on contractual commitments and changes in estimates on the ultimate losses for certain legal and environmental issues and related costs 
in  these charges were primarily identified in the accounting review or resulted from the company s strategic plan discussed above 
in  these costs were primarily due to the sale of most of the company s wm international operations as part of the company s strategic plan and the termination of the wm holding s defined benefit pension plan 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense in  as compared to  is primarily due to the net debt reduction in from proceeds related to the company s divestiture program and cash flows from operations 
the increase in interest expense in  as compared to  is due to higher average levels of outstanding indebtedness during the respective years and also a decline in the company s public credit rating  which began in the last six months of and caused the company to increase its use of more costly bank credit facilities instead of the previously used commercial paper 
also contributing to period to period changes in interest expense is the offsetting decrease in the amount of interest that the company has capitalized during these years 
the company capitalized interest of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million  million and million for  and  respectively  resulting in an effective income tax rate of  and for each of the three years  respectively 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for these years is primarily due to state and local income taxes  non deductible costs related to acquired intangibles  non deductible costs associated with the impairment and divestiture of certain businesses and other charges and adjustments as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  which are no longer permanently reinvested 
excluding non deductible held for sale impairment charges associated with certain businesses  non deductible losses on the divestiture of assets that closed during the period and other unusual items  the company s tax provision would have been of pre tax income for liquidity and capital resources the company operates in an industry that requires a high level of capital investment 
the company s capital requirements primarily stem from i its working capital needs for its ongoing operations  ii capital expenditures for construction and expansion of its landfill sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for its collection operations  iii refurbishments and improvements at its waste to energy facilities and iv business acquisitions 
the company s strategy is to meet these capital needs first from internally generated funds 
historically  the company has also obtained financing from various financing sources available to the company at the time  including the incurrence of debt and the issuance of its common stock 
in august  the company announced a strategic plan that included the sale of its wm international operations  its non core operations and selected nasw operations 
the proceeds from these dispositions  which were primarily realized in  were used for debt repayment 
at both december  and march   the company has unused and available credit capacity under its bank credit facilities of billion 
the company believes that these levels of credit capacity are sufficient to meet its ongoing operating requirements 
the following is a summary of the company s cash flows statements for the years ended december   and in millions operating activities    investing activities    financing activities   in and  cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by the implementation of company s merger integration plans for the mergers with wm holdings and eastern environmental services  and the subsequent operational and administrative difficulties discussed above 
in  the company spent approximately billion on the acquisition of businesses and outstanding minority interest positions  as well as approximately billion on capital expenditures 
these investing activities in were primarily funded by cash flows from operations  net debt borrowings of approximately billion  proceeds from sales of assets of approximately million and proceeds from the sale of common and treasury stock of approximately million 
in  the company spent approximately billion on acquisitions of businesses and approximately billion on capital expenditures 
these investing activities were funded by cash flows from operations  net debt borrowings of approximately million and proceeds from the sale of assets of approximately million 
in  cash flows from operations were impacted by several factors that the company considers to be unusual  including costs for professional accounting fees and consulting activities associated with stabilizing and improving the accounting systems and developing new enterprise information systems discussed above 
the following summary of free cash flows has been prepared to highlight and facilitate understanding of the primary cash flow elements 
it is not intended to replace the consolidated statement of cash flows for  which was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
adjusted free cash flow in the table below  which is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  is defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures and then adjusted for certain cash flow activity that the company considers as unusual for the year in millions 
ebitda a  interest paid taxes paid change in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures  and other net cash provided by operating activities  capital expenditures  free cash flow adjustments tax refund payments for terminating the wm holdings defined benefit pension plan accounting and consulting services litigation settlements reimbursement for late allocation of employee stock purchase plan shares other adjusted free cash flow  a ebitda is defined as income from operations excluding depreciation and amortization  merger and acquisition related costs and asset impairments and unusual items 
ebitda  which is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  is provided because the company understands that such information is used by certain investors when analyzing the financial position and performance of the company 
consistent with the strategic initiative discussed above  in the company had a net debt reduction of approximately billion funded through its divestiture program and cash flows from operations 
under the terms of the company s billion syndicated loan facility the syndicated facility and its billion senior revolving credit facility the credit facility  the company is obligated to repay the borrowings under the facilities with the cash proceeds received from the strategic plan divestitures 
the company was required to use all of the first billion of net proceeds from the divestitures to repay indebtedness  which it has done 
additionally  the company is required to use of the additional cash proceeds greater than billion and up to billion from divestitures to repay the indebtedness under the syndicated and credit facilities 
as of december   the company had received cash proceeds of approximately billion from its divestitures  approximately million of which was used to repay the company s eurocurrency facilities in the second quarter of  approximately million was used for repayment of divestiture subsidiary debts and the remainder of which has been used to repay indebtedness under the bank credit facilities 
on july   the company issued million of mandatorily tendered senior notes  due july  this debt instrument is subject to certain mandatory tender features as described in the indenture  which may require the purchase by the company of a portion of or all of the outstanding notes on july  the company intends to either refinance these notes or use borrowings available under the syndicated facility and or the credit facility in the event it must purchase the notes on july  accordingly  these borrowings have been classified as long term at december  in february of the company issued million of senior unsecured notes due august  interest is payable semi annually on february and august the net proceeds from the sale of the notes are approximately million  after deducting discounts to the underwriters and estimated expenses of the offering 
the company intends to use the net proceeds  together with cash on hand  to repay in full the million principal amount outstanding under the senior notes due may   the million principal amount outstanding under the senior notes due may   and the million principal amount outstanding under the senior notes due june  pending application of the proceeds as described  the proceeds will be invested temporarily in short term investments or be used to reduce short term borrowings 
recent developments the company has proposed a settlement to resolve a consolidated derivative action pending in the chancery court of the state of delaware 
the derivative action was brought against several former officers and directors of waste management holdings and seeks  among other things  reimbursement of those monies expended by waste management holdings and the company in resolving all claims brought against wm holdings arising out of its february restatement of earnings 
the terms of the settlement include a payment to the company of million by certain of wm holdings insurance carriers and the complete resolution of all pending claims for retirement benefits between certain former officers of wm holdings and the company 
the resolution of the actions for retirement benefits involves the release by the former executives who brought claims against the company for certain amounts otherwise owing under the retirement plans 
the total benefits to the company from the settlement of the derivative case is approximately million 
environmental matters the company has material financial commitments for the costs associated with its future obligations for final closure  which is the closure of the landfills and the capping of the final uncapped areas of the landfills  and for post closure of the landfills it operates or for which it is otherwise responsible 
the final closure and post closure liabilities are charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the present value of total estimated final closure and post closure cost will be accrued for each landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
the company has also established procedures to evaluate its potential remedial liabilities at closed sites which it owns or operated  or to which it transported waste  including sites listed on the epa s national priority list npl 
the majority of situations involving npl sites relate to allegations that subsidiaries of the company or their predecessors transported waste to the facilities in question  often prior to the acquisition of such subsidiaries by the company 
in instances in which the company has concluded that it is probable that a liability has been incurred  an accrual has been recorded in the financial statements 
estimates of the extent of the company s degree of responsibility for remediation of a particular site and the method and ultimate cost of remediation require a number of assumptions and are inherently difficult  and the ultimate outcome may differ from current estimates 
however  the company believes that its extensive experience in the environmental services business  as well as its involvement with a large number of sites  provides a reasonable basis for estimating its aggregate liability 
as additional information becomes available  estimates are adjusted as necessary 
while the company does not anticipate that any such adjustment would be material to its financial statements  it is reasonably possible that technological  regulatory or enforcement developments  the results of environmental studies  the nonexistence or inability of other potentially responsible third parties to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities  or other factors could necessitate the recording of additional liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  the company has estimated that the aggregate cost of environmental liabilities as of december  is approximately billion 
as of december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  for the present value of final closure and post closure costs of disposal facilities 
the difference between the final closure and post closure costs accrued at december   and the total present value of estimated costs represents final closure and post closure costs that will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total present value of estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
the average landfill final closure and post closure expense  on a per ton basis  for the landfills operating at december  was per ton 
as of december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  for the present value of remediation costs of disposal facilities 
for fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million for our final closure  post closure and remediation expenditures 
as of december   the company also expects to incur approximately billion related to future construction activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites  which are capitalized as incurred and expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed 
the average landfill airspace amortization cost per ton for the landfills operating at december  was per ton 
seasonality and inflation the company s operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months  which corresponds with the company s first and fourth quarters 
this is primarily attributable to the facts that i the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities tends to increase in the spring and summer months and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months 
the company believes that inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  any material adverse effect on the results of operations in the near future

 no material changes to revenue recognition occurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices and certain equity prices 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
the derivatives used are simple agreements that provide for payments based on the notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
all derivatives are related to actual or anticipated exposures of transactions of the company 
while the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and the company does not anticipate non performance 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company monitors its derivative positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
the company has performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of the company s market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from the company s assumptions 
the effects of such market movements may also directly or indirectly affect the company s assumptions and its rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect on the company from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt obligations  which are mainly denominated in us dollars 
in addition  interest rate swaps are generally used to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest expense of certain floating rate debt obligations or to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations 
an instantaneous  one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of the company s combined debt and interest rate swap positions at december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items such as pension liabilities  nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
since a significant portion of the company s debt is at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
currency rate exposure 
the company incurred exchange rate risk from borrowings denominated in foreign currencies at december  an instantaneous  ten percent increase in foreign exchange rates would have decreased the fair value of the company s foreign currency borrowings by approximately million 
the company had no foreign currency borrowings at december  commodities price exposure 
the company markets recycled paper products such as old newspaper onp and old corrugated containers occ 
the company started entering into financial swaps in in an effort to mitigate the risk of recyclable paper price fluctuations 
under its financial swap agreements  the company transfers a floating market price for a fixed price for a fixed period of time 
the two parties agree to use a market index as an indicator of the market price during the term of the swap 
an instantaneous ten percent increase in this commodity at december  and creates an exposure risk of approximately million and  respectively 
the increase in exposure risk from to is attributable to the greater number of financial swap agreements that were outstanding at the end of the respective periods 
all of the company s waste paper hedges are cash settled on a monthly basis with the counterparty 
equity price exposure
