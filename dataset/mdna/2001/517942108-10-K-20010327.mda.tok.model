the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo and ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo and ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties
