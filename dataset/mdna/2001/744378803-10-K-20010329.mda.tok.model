the decrease in net sales in the construction products business is primarily attributable to a softening of the construction products market 
the decrease in sales in the printer supplies business is primarily the result of i the change in the company s focus to sales of higher margin  lower priced  printer supply products which the company manufactures rather than on resales of lower margin  higher priced  branded printer supplies which the company purchases from third parties and ii the continuing decrease in sales of supplies for impact printers 
the gross profit percentage increase in from is primarily the result of an increase in gross profit percentage at the company s printer supplies business 
gross profit on printer supplies manufactured by the company is significantly higher than the gross profit from resale supplies purchased by the company 
in addition  the company s printer supplies business introduced direct to end user catalogs in the first quarter of which has resulted in higher gross profits on printer supplies sales 
the printer supplies business also closed its wisconsin label coating plant in the first quarter of the company has been able to buy the substrates previously processed in the wisconsin plant from outside vendors  eliminating the cost of running the wisconsin plant

had these tax assets been fully recognized prior to  the company would have recorded a tax provision in of  net income of  and basic and dilutive earnings per common share of rather than the net income of  and basic and dilutive earnings per common share of 
because the company has now recognized all of its deferred tax assets  future provisions for income taxes should more closely approximate the statutory rates

the company s construction products business historically achieves a lower gross profit and the mix of sales at the construction products business in was weighted more heavily toward lower gross profit products 
the decrease in sales in the printer supplies business is largely attributable to the decline in sales of supplies for impact printers 
this decline is expected to continue as additional impact printers in the marketplace are replaced by other types of printing devices 
sales of label machines and supplies also declined in although the company s label printers are now manufactured offshore  the lower manufacturing costs are being passed on to customers in the form of price reductions

no assurance can be given that these new product introductions will be successful 
a number of factors could affect their success  including changes in technology  competitive pressures  raw material costs  patent issues and other factors which affect businesses generally 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during was primarily the result of an increase in such expenses at the company s construction products business caused by new product introduction  trade show participation  sales commissions and other expenses  all of which were associated with the increase in sales at the construction products business
