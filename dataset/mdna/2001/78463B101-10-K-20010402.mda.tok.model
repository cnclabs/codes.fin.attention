our solutions are designed to reach beyond traditional online financial services to help organizations deliver value to their customers  resulting in greater customer retention and increased revenue opportunities for our clients 
during  we operated and managed our business in three segments financial institutions  call center technology and internet aggregation services 
the financial institutions segment builds  delivers and operates integrated  transactional and brandable internet applications for financial institutions worldwide  available as an in house solution or outsourced to the s data center 
during the third quarter of  the financial institution segment was reported in two parts large financial institutions and community banks 
we combined these two segments in the fourth quarter of as a result of a change in the way we operate and manage the business 
the financial institutions segment provides highly customized solutions to large global and national financial institutions  as well as solutions that require little or no customization and are primarily sold to community and regional banks 
through the call center technology business segment  we offer interactive voice response and voice e commerce technology 
through our verticalone subsidiary  our internet aggregation services segment provided technology that enables consumers to aggregate personal account information from multiple sources 
in january  we sold our verticalone subsidiary to yodlee 
com  inc in  this segment will no longer exist and the investment in yodlee will be accounted for on an equity basis 
in addition  through our relationship with yodlee  we will be a reseller of account aggregation services 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from three sources software licenses 
we receive license fees from direct licensees and third party data processors 
direct licensees install and operate our products in their own environments 
we generally receive an initial license fee plus ongoing fees  which are based on either the number of end users or a percentage of the initial license fee 
we generally recognize revenues from software license sales upon delivery 
when services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  the software license and the related services are recognized over the implementation period using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
a portion of our software license revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over either the term of the agreement or  for contracts without a term  the estimated period during which post contract support is expected to be provided 
under these arrangements  post contract support and maintenance were bundled as part of the license agreements and sufficient vendor specific evidence did not exist to allocate the total fee to all elements of the arrangement 
third party data processors install our products in their own data processing centers and license the product to their client institutions  typically smaller financial services entities like community banks and thrifts 
we receive monthly fees from third party data processors based on the total number of end users served by the processors client institutions 
these fees are recognized as revenue in the period earned 
professional services 
we provide professional services related to the installation and integration of our products 
these services include installing the product at direct licensees and third party data processing centers  integrating the financial organization data processing systems with our data center for data center clients  providing product enhancements  consulting  and training 
revenues derived from contracts to provide services on a time and materials basis are recognized as the related services are performed 
revenues from professional services provided on a fixed fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
data center 
we receive recurring monthly fees from financial institutions that have chosen to use our software and outsource the processing of their financial transactions to our data center 
these fees are generally based on the number of end users of the client institution 
in addition  we receive monthly fees for technical support 
we recognize these revenues as the services are performed 
as a result of the size of the companies with which we do business  the magnitude of our implementations and our limited amount of capacity to perform implementations  a significant portion of our revenues may be attributed to a limited number of clients in any given period 
comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december  in  we operated and managed our business in three segments financial institutions  call center technology and internet aggregation services 
the following is a discussion of the results of the company for as compared to the discussion includes an analysis of costs that are not allocated to segments  including depreciation and amortization  marketing cost from warrants issued  merger related and restructuring costs  acquired in process research and development costs and amortization and impairment of acquisition intangibles 
in addition  we provide general and administrative to the operating segments on a shared services basis and we do not allocate these costs to the individual segments 
a discussion of the operating segments  including revenues  direct costs  gross margins  sales and marketing costs and product development costs follows the consolidated operations discussion 
consolidated operations revenues  direct costs and gross margins 
total revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
approximately million of the increase in total revenues is attributed to the three acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of and two acquisitions completed in the second quarter of the primary components of revenue for the year ended december  were million in software license fees  million in professional services fees  million in data center fees and million in other revenue 
direct costs increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and increase of 
approximately million of the increase in direct costs is attributed to the three acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of and two acquisitions completed in the second quarter of gross margins were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
selling and marketing and product development expenses 
total selling and marketing and product development expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase in these expenses is attributed to the three acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of and two acquisitions completed in the second quarter of these expenses are discussed further in the segment analysis section 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from the five acquisitions completed between the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of in addition  we increased our expenditures on general and administrative expenses to increase personnel required to manage the growth as well as to establish a global infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
depreciation and amortization expenses were and of total revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively 
a substantial portion of the increase is the result of the acquisition of five companies and their existing infrastructures during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of the balance of the increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of additional equipment for data center customers and the build out of the new data centers in singapore and uk 
we anticipate that the depreciation and amortization related to the new data centers will continue to increase as the new uk data center went into full production during the fourth quarter of and as new and existing customers expand their activities in the data centers 
marketing cost for warrants issued 
the company recorded million of marketing costs for the year ended december  which includes a charge for  related to the vesting of a warrant previously granted to accenture and a charge of approximately million for a warrant issued in connection with a pilot project and distribution agreement between a third party and one of our subsidiaries 
the fair values of the warrants were determined based on the black scholes option pricing model 
merger related and restructuring costs 
during and  the company incurred merger related costs of million and million  respectively 
the merger related costs were related to the three acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of  two acquisitions in the second quarter of and one acquisition in the fourth quarter of these costs were incurred to integrate the products and platforms of the acquired companies  training personnel on the new products acquired  and the cost of building the infrastructure necessary to support a global operation 
included in the merger related costs are approximately million of personnel costs related to professional service employees who were being cross trained on the products and services of the acquired companies 
approximately million of merger related costs consist of the cost of product development personnel working on the integration of the products and platforms acquired 
approximately million of merger related costs consist of the cost of upgrading worldwide systems and infrastructure required to manage a global operation 
any continuing costs related to continuing integration efforts  which will be limited  will be included in the professional services and product development categories in the statement of operations in future periods 
in addition  included in merger related costs are expenses incurred pursuing transactions that did not result in a strategic arrangement 
in november  we approved a restructuring plan related to the streamlining of operations which resulted in the decision to discontinue development on the edify retail banking platform 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and closed several facilities worldwide 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge for the costs associated with the exit plan of approximately million 
s will continue to offer support services to the approximately financial institutions using this platform for up to months 
during this period  we will offer the existing customers a migration path to other s products 
as a result of discontinuing the product  certain customers may elect to move to our competitor s products resulting in a potential reduction in future revenues from the discontinued products 
acquired in process research and development 
on april   in connection with the acquisition of q up  we allocated a million of million purchase price to acquired in process research and development 
q up was involved in the development of technology to provide financial institutions with the means to deploy a suite of automated banking services via the internet 
the allocation of million to in process research and development represented its estimated fair value using the methodology described below 
we allocated the million to the internet banking systems ibs 
at the time of the acquisition  we forecasted that aggregate revenues attributable to the projects would reach approximately million in we expected revenues for the projects to peak between to with limited revenues thereafter as we expect to introduce new product technologies 
at the acquisition date  we estimated costs to complete the research and development efforts related to the initial release of the projects to be approximately million 
we utilized an average risk adjusted discount rate of to discount projected cashflows 
development of the in process ibs project started in december and was anticipated to  and did  reach technological feasibility in october the most substantial upgrade to the core technology will be the migration of the system from a flat file format to a more dynamic sql database format 
as part of the process of analyzing the acquisition of q up  we made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally 
we based this decision on factors such as the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market  available resources and its progression in developing comparable technology  if any 
we determined the fair value of in process research and development for the q up acquisition using an income approach 
this involved estimating the present value of the after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates and revenue forecasts as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows related to the in process research and development were made for each project based on our estimates of revenue  operating expenses and income taxes from the project 
these estimates were consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels for similar products 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
estimated operating expenses include cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the research and development expenses include estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market 
the selection of the discount rate was based on consideration of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as factors including the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances that were known at the time  and the stage of completion of each technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts represent fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
at the date of acquisition  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the values allocated to these projects were immediately expensed upon acquisition 
where appropriate  we deducted an amount reflecting the contribution of developed technology to the anticipated cash flows of in process research and development projects 
the project was completed during however  as we begin the marketing and distribution of this product  our product pricing and growth rates may not be achieved and we may not realize the financial benefits expected from the projects 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangible assets increased billion to billion for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the increase  approximately million related to the amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets resulting from the three acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and the two acquisitions in the second quarter of and million related to an impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of we continually monitor the results of operations and other developments within the industry to adjust cash flow forecasts  as necessary  to determine if any adjustment is necessary to the carrying value of the our intangible assets 
accordingly  at december   we recorded an impairment charge of million to adjust the intangible assets acquired in connection with the fics  edify  q up and davidge acquisitions 
in accordance with established policy  we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying amount of our intangible assets in light of developments during the fourth quarter of as a result of i significant declines in projected revenues  ii a significant and sustained decline in our stock price since the dates of acquisitions  iii the abandonment of certain technology related to the restructuring effort and iv a reduction in the workforce at fics and edify  management prepared an undiscounted  net operating cash flow analysis to determine if the intangible assets were recoverable 
the following key assumptions were used in management s analysis i revenues would grow in the range of to  depending on the operating unit  over the next years  and ii operating expenses would grow in proportion to the revenue growth projected for each operating unit 
since the undiscounted cash flow model indicated an impairment of the intangible assets  we used a discounted cash flow model to measure the fair value of these intangible assets which determined that the fair value of the intangible assets was approximately million 
accordingly  we wrote off million of goodwill  million of purchased technology  million of assembled workforce and million of customer lists related to the fics  edify  q up and davidge acquisitions 
of the million impairment charge  million related to the financial institutions segment and million related to the call center segment 
segment analysis during  we operated and managed the company in three business segments financial institutions  call center technology and internet aggregation services

we recorded million of marketing costs in the year ended december  related to the issuance to a third party of a stock warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant was issued in connection with a pilot project and distribution agreement between the third party and one of our subsidiaries 
the fair value of the warrant was determined based on the black scholes option pricing model 
this amount is being amortized over the period of the pilot project and distribution agreement  which is approximately days 
merger related and restructuring costs 
we recorded million in the year ended december  related to the acquisitions of edify  fics  and verticalone 
merger related costs consist primarily of expenditures related to building and consolidating infrastructure and other operations of the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisitions of edify  fics and verticalone  we allocated a portion of the respective purchase prices to acquired in process research and development 
as part of the process of analyzing each of these acquisitions  we made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally 
we based this decision on factors such as the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market  available resources and its progression in developing comparable technology  if any 
we determined the fair value of in process research and development for each of the above acquisitions using an income approach 
this involved estimating the present value of the after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates and revenue forecasts as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows related to the in process research and development were made for each project based on our estimates of revenue  operating expenses and income taxes from the project 
these estimates were consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels for similar products 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
estimated operating expenses include cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the research and development expenses include estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market 
the selection of the discount rate was based on consideration of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as factors including the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances that were known at the time  and the stage of completion of each technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts represent fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
at the date of acquisition  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the values allocated to these projects were immediately expensed upon acquisition 
where appropriate  we deducted an amount reflecting the contribution of developed technology to the anticipated cash flows of in process research and development projects 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  our product pricing and growth rates may not be achieved and we may not realize the financial benefits expected from the projects 
the acquisitions and related in process research and development expenses are detailed in the table below in millions acquisition purchase in process costs to company date price r d expense complete edify november  fics november  verticalone november  specific details relating to the three acquisitions are discussed below

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  and investment securities available for sale  which consisted entirely of equity securities  of million at december  compared to million at december  during the year ended december   cash used in operations was million compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in operations between and is primarily the result of the net loss of  million for the period offset by non cash charges of  million  the reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the comparable period of the increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was the result of the proceeds from the sale of investment securities available for sale of million and million of cash acquired through acquisitions  which was offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
capital expenditures in relate to the expansion of our facilities infrastructure to accommodate our growth and the establishment of our new data center facilities in asia and europe 
during the year ended december  investments were made in companies that are considered to have technology or products that compliment our product and services offerings 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period of the increase relates to proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  from the sale of preferred stock and million in proceeds from common stock sold under the employee stock purchase and option plans during the year ended december  during the year ended december  the company received proceeds of million  net of expenses  for the sale of common stock 
basic loss per share is calculated as income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common stock that would share in the earnings of the company 
because of the company s net losses  the issuance of additional shares of common stock under stock options and warrants or upon the conversion of preferred stock would be antidilutive 
the total number of common shares that would have been used in the company s computation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million borrowings outstanding and approximately million available under various line of credit facilities 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
the foreign currency financial statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenues  costs and expenses  which are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of our international operations to us dollars in consolidation 
at this time  we do not use instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations would not be material 
the net liabilities of our foreign operations at december  were approximately million 
for our operating locations in countries participating in the european union  the euro was adopted as their common legal currency effective january  we have not experienced any significant problems related to the euro conversion and do not expect the euro conversion to have a material impact on our results of operations 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in our investment securities available for 
at december   our marketable securities were recorded at fair value of approximately million 
our investment securities have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would reduce the carrying value of our investment as well as our unrealized gain on investment securities available for sale which is included as a component of stockholders equity 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of our investment securities available for sale 
our only long term liabilities are capital lease obligations at a fixed rate 
therefore  we do not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates relating to current or long term liabilities
