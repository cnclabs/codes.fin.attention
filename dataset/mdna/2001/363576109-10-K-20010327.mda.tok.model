item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general fluctuations in premiums charged by insurance companies have a direct and potentially material effect on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels 
for more than a decade and into  lower premium rates prevailed among property casualty insurance carriers resulting in heavy competition for market share 
this soft market ie  lower premium rates generally resulted in flat or reduced renewal commissions 
in recent years  natural catastrophes have resulted in billions of dollars in underwriting losses to the insurance market 
substantial mergers  both domestically and internationally  have resulted in fewer insurance companies 
increased property replacement costs and increasingly large litigation awards have caused some clients to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
these factors would generally have the effect of generating higher premiums to clients and higher commissions to gallagher 
in spite of these forces  there have been mitigating factors including favorable equity markets  increased underwriting capital causing heavy competition for market share and improved economies of scale following consolidations  all of which tended to lower premium rates 
the net result is property casualty premium rates have remained low through mid underwriting losses and the downward turn in equity markets in have placed insurers in the situation of having to replenish depleted reserves 
to accomplish this  many carriers began to increase premium rates in the latter part of and throughout  across many sectors of the insurance marketplace 
these increases are viewed as a hardening of the market ie  higher premium rates  and generally  result in increased commission revenues 
although a hardening market contributes positively to gallagher s results  the longevity of a hard market and its effect on gallagher s business are difficult to predict 
though inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures  premium rates have historically had a greater effect on gallagher s revenues than inflation 
because of rising insurance costs  management believes there is a trend for certain risk buyers to move toward the alternative insurance market  which would tend to have a favorable effect on gallagher s risk management services segment 
gallagher anticipates that new sales in the areas of risk management  claims management  insurance captive and self insurance services will continue to be a major factor in gallagher s fee revenue growth during gallagher continues to look to the future and to pursue expansion not only in the core segments of insurance brokerage and risk management services  but also within financial services 
management believes these areas continue to hold opportunities for diversification and profitable growth 
results of operations consolidated gallagher s results of operations for periods prior to have been restated for acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests as if they had operated as part of gallagher prior to the date of merger 
gallagher continues to search for merger partners which complement existing operations  provide entry into new markets  add new products and enhance local sales and service capabilities 
for the effect of these restatements  in the aggregate  on year to year comparisons  see note to the consolidated financial statements

the increase in is due primarily to new business and the million write off in of intangible assets associated with lost business 
the decrease in is due primarily to new business offset by the intangible asset write off just described 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

only revenues not attributable to one of the three operating segments are recorded in corporate 
all costs are generated in the united states 
financial condition and liquidity the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive 
gallagher has historically been profitable  and cash flows from operations and short term borrowings under various credit agreements have been sufficient to fund operating  investment and capital expenditure needs of the company 
cash generated from operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because of the variability related to the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable  net cash flows from operations vary substantially from year to year 
funds restricted as to gallagher s use  primarily premiums held as fiduciary funds  have not been included in determining gallagher s overall liquidity 
gallagher had a million unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement requiring repayment of any loans under the agreement no later than june  during and  gallagher borrowed and repaid million and million  respectively  of short term borrowings under the credit agreement 
these borrowings were primarily used to finance a portion of gallagher s operating and investment activity 
in september  gallagher terminated this agreement 
gallagher also had three line of credit facilities totaling million that were to expire on april  periodically  gallagher made short term borrowings under these facilities to meet short term cash flow needs and had a balance of million outstanding at december  during  gallagher borrowed million and repaid million of borrowings under these facilities 
during  gallagher borrowed million and repaid million of short term borrowings under these facilities 
the repayments satisfied all remaining loan balances under these facilities and these agreements were terminated in september borrowings under these facilities were primarily used to finance a portion of gallagher s operating and investment activities 
as of september   gallagher and one of its significant subsidiaries entered into a three year unsecured revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement for loans and letters of credit with a group of five financial institutions 
this agreement replaces the million credit agreement and the million line of credit facilities mentioned above 
the revolving credit agreement provides for short term and long term revolving credit commitments of million and million  respectively 
all letter of credit arrangements issued under the revolving credit agreement are applied against the million long term facility in the determination of net funds available for future borrowing 
as of december   under this agreement  gallagher has contingently committed to funding million through letter of credit arrangements related to certain of its investments and insurance programs 
the revolving credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants and gallagher is in compliance with these covenants 
gallagher paid million in cash dividends on its common stock in gallagher s dividend policy is determined by the board of directors 
quarterly dividends are declared after considering gallagher s available cash from earnings and its anticipated cash needs 
in each quarter of  gallagher paid a dividend of 
per share which was 
or greater than each quarterly dividend in net capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although not considered available for domestic needs  the undistributed earnings generated by certain foreign subsidiaries referred to above may be used to finance foreign operations and acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gallagher is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
gallagher does not enter into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following analyses present the hypothetical loss in fair value of the financial instruments held by gallagher at december  and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the range of changes in interest rates used in the analyses reflects gallagher s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
this discussion of market risks related to gallagher s consolidated balance sheets includes estimates of future economic environments caused by changes in market risks 
the effect of actual changes in these risk factors may differ materially from gallagher s estimates 
in the ordinary course of business  gallagher also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable  including credit risk and legal risk 
these risks are not included in the following analyses 
gallagher has a comprehensive and diversified investment portfolio 
gallagher s invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents  investment strategies trading and marketable securities available for sale 
accordingly  these assets are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the fair value of gallagher s cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio at december  and approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio 
the resulting fair value was not materially different from the carrying values at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of gallagher s investment strategies trading portfolio was million and million  respectively 
from an investment management perspective  this portfolio  which is managed by several independent fund managers  consists of two different components an equity portfolio of million and million and an alternative investment strategies portfolio of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the equity portfolio is subject to equity price risk 
it is not hedged  consists of common stocks and is primarily managed to produce realized gains for gallagher 
the estimated potential loss in fair value of this equity component resulting from a hypothetical decrease in prices quoted by stock exchanges of would be approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
gallagher s alternative investment strategies portfolio is also subject to equity pricing risk 
however  these investments are actively managed in order to minimize gallagher s exposure to equity pricing risk 
the objective of this portfolio is to maximize the overall return to gallagher  while minimizing the downward price risk in order to preserve the investments underlying principal balances 
the independent fund managers for these alternative investment strategies hedge their strategies by selling short common equity securities in order to mitigate the effects of changes in equity prices thereby making any such fluctuations immaterial 
accordingly  hypothetical changes in equity prices would not cause the resulting fair value to be materially different from the carrying value for this portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of gallagher s marketable securities available for sale portfolio was million million less than its aggregate amortized cost and million million less than its aggregate amortized cost at december  and  respectively 
the overall objective of this portfolio is to provide gallagher with a stable after tax yield 
this portfolio  which is not hedged  consists primarily of dividend yielding preferred stocks 
accordingly  this portfolio is more sensitive to interest rate risk than it is to equity pricing risk 
the estimated potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in short term interest rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   the fair value of gallagher s borrowings under the line of credit facilities approximated the carrying value due to their short term duration and variable interest rates 
these agreements were terminated in september and replaced by the revolving credit agreement 
at december  there were no borrowings under this agreement 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in gallagher s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december  and the resulting fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily due to the fact that its united kingdom based subsidiaries incur expenses denominated in british pounds while receiving their revenues in us dollars 
gallagher does not hedge this foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings before income taxes as they are incurred 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for and a weakening of the us dollar  earnings before income taxes would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively 
gallagher is also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
however  it is management s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to gallagher s consolidated operating results or financial position 
gallagher manages the balance sheets of its foreign subsidiaries such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets thereby maintaining a balanced book which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of gallagher are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the following gallagher s commission revenues are highly dependent on premiums charged by insurers  which are subject to fluctuation  lower interest rates reduce gallagher s income earned on invested funds  the alternative insurance market continues to grow which could unfavorably impact commission and favorably impact fee revenue  gallagher s revenues vary significantly from period to period as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the net effect of new and lost business production  the general level of economic activity can have a substantial impact on gallagher s renewal business  gallagher s operating results  return on investment and financial position may be adversely impacted by exposure to various market risks such as interest rate  equity pricing  foreign exchange rates and the competitive environment  and changes in income tax laws 
gallagher s ability to grow has been enhanced through acquisitions  which may or may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which  if consummated  may or may not be advantageous to gallagher 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements
