income taxes years ended march  and as of march   the company has net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of  of long term deferred tax assets and  of current deferred tax assets 
the company has provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon management s estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation was based in large part on the company s history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
the company s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
management has considered the above factors in reaching its conclusions that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will meet its expectations of future taxable income 
the effective income tax rate was approximately of income before income taxes for as compared to an effective income tax rate of approximately for and the provision benefit in and resulted directly from the recognition of income losses incurred from continuing operations and was provided at a lower than statutory rate due to the tax implications of state and local net operating loss carryforwards arising from the and losses in certain jurisdictions

proceeds from the sale were used to repay obligations outstanding under the company s bank line of credit 
as a result of the operational separations  the company has recorded a one time net of tax charge of approximately million or in the quarter ended september  this charge reduced the book value of the operations to their expected net realizable value  provides for losses on fulfilling certain obligations and close down costs and included the estimated future operating losses of the visiting nurse operations prior to separation 
these changes have been accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
the estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations reflected in the accompanying financial statements includes management s estimate of the results of operating the visiting nurse segment prior to disposal and the estimated financial results of such disposal based on information available at the time the loss was recorded 
revenues from discontinued operations were approximately   and  for the years ended march   and respectively 
for periods prior to the sale  interest expense has been allocated to continuing and discontinued operations on the basis of relative net assets 
accordingly  interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations in the amounts of approximately   and  for the years ended march   and respectively 
the accompanying balance sheet includes net current assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  consisting primarily of accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and long term assets of discontinued operations consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  goodwill and debt 
visiting nurse operations the results of operations for the visiting nurse segment for the fiscal year ended march  are presented in the table below 
the second half columns present the results of operations for the six month period from october  through march   during which medicare pps was in effect

as shown in the table above  the vn operations incurred net losses in the first six months of this fiscal year operating under the old cost based reimbursement system 
in the second six months  the company earned a higher rate of reimbursement and incurred lower operating costs on its vn operations than were earned and incurred respectively in the first half 
costs of services  primarily labor and related costs  were reduced by almost 
the company cared for  medicare patients in the second half of the year compared to  medicare patients in the first half 
additionally  the company has reduced unprofitable insurance and managed care business 
depreciation increased due to investment in a computerized clinical management system to support operation under pps 
bad debt expense approximated of revenues based on historical collection results 
since medicare pps is still relatively new  this rate may differ in the future 
interest expense  is primarily related to bank borrowings 
although discontinued operations accounting treatment is being used for this segment  earnings are reported in the company s income statement for the second half of the year 
under discontinued operations accounting rules  losses incurred in the comparable periods of last year and in the first half of this year were previously provided for in the one time charge recorded in fiscal thus  in the table shown above the line less previously provided reduces the reported operating losses for the first half to zero 
the bba and subsequent amendments  as they currently stand  call for a reduction in pps reimbursement rates of effective october  the federal budget for the coming federal fiscal year is currently being developed in congress and legislative proposals have been made to eliminate  and or postpone this reduction 
however  unless congress and the president change the law as it currently exists  the rate cut will take place on october  the company is unable to predict whether such a rate cut will take place 
should such a rate cut take place  it would have a material adverse effect on the financial performance and the potential disposition value of the vn business segment 
the company is continuing to evaluate its strategic alternatives for this business segment  the outcome of which will be highly dependant upon the resolution of the rate cut issue

health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document and proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as the company 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures
