competition regulated electric and gas markets efforts to restructure electric markets at the state level have slowed considerably 
dwindling operating reserves and rolling blackouts in parts of california in january and february have been widely reported nationwide 
these shortages of electricity have been attributed to flawed state restructuring legislation  unplanned generating plant shutdowns and other economic factors 
in response  many states that had passed or considered legislation to restructure the electric industry have stopped such efforts or are proceeding more slowly 
in south carolina  electric restructuring efforts also have stalled 
the developments unfolding in california  and several unrelated  contentious issues before the general assembly have combined to make consideration of electric restructuring legislation unlikely in legislation or regulatory action at the federal level  particularly as a part of a larger energy policy initiative  may be considered in the company is not able to predict whether any restructuring legislation or regulatory action will be enacted and  if it is  the conditions it will impose on utilities 
the company has taken several steps to prepare for restructuring  including aggressive participation in the newly deregulated natural gas market in georgia further discussed at georgia retail gas market below 
in addition  scana s electric and gas utility  sce g  has undertaken a variety of initiatives aimed at preparing for a restructured electric market 
these initiatives include obtaining accelerated recovery of electric regulatory assets  establishing open access transmission tariffs and selling bulk power to wholesale customers at market based rates 
marketing of services to commercial and industrial customers has also increased significantly  and sce g has obtained long term power supply contracts with a significant portion of its industrial customers 
the company believes that these actions  as well as numerous others that have been and will be taken  demonstrate its ability and commitment to succeed in the evolving operating environment 
regulated public utilities are allowed to record as assets some costs that would be expensed by other enterprises 
if deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  the company may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets from its balance sheet 
although the potential effects of deregulation cannot be determined at present  discontinuation of the accounting treatment could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period the write off would be recorded 
it is expected that cash flows and the financial position of the company would not be materially affected by the discontinuation of the accounting treatment 
the company reported approximately million and million of regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  including amounts recorded for deferred income tax assets and liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively  on its balance sheet at december  the company s generation assets are exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in these assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december  the company s net investment in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets was  million and million  respectively 
north carolina gas market on february  scana completed its acquisition of public service company of north carolina  inc psnc in a transaction valued at approximately million  including the assumption of debt 
the transaction has been accounted for as a purchase 
psnc is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of scana 
as a result of the transaction  scana became a registered public utility holding company under puhca 
georgia retail gas market scana energy  the retail gas division of energy marketing  has been aggressively marketing natural gas to residential and commercial customers in georgia 
scana energy is georgia s second largest gas marketer  with approximately  customers at december   or approximately a percent market share 
for purposes of comparison  scana energy had approximately  customers at december  and  at december  in scana energy successfully transitioned from start up to ongoing operations and for the year ended december  recognized net earnings of approximately million 
scana energy s strategy includes the determination of methodologies to serve all customer classes profitably and developing programs that will enhance relationships with those customers and attract similar new customers 
in addition scana energy has successfully employed a gas supply hedging strategy and has maintained a price structure that is both competitive and profitable 
the level of future revenues and expenditures is dependent on several factors  including scana energy s ability to retain customers and market share  the weather  the margin achieved on gas sales and its ability to find industrial interruptible customers to purchase available capacity 
proposed interstate pipeline pipeline corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is developing plans for an interstate natural gas pipeline to ensure adequate supplies to growing gas markets 
the anticipated interstate pipeline will require pipeline corporation to file an application for approval with the ferc and other federal and state agencies 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirements arise primarily from sce g s and psnc s operational needs  the company s construction program  the need to fund the activities or investments of scana s nonregulated subsidiaries and payment of dividends 
the ability of scana s regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas  will depend upon their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
scana s regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and the regulated subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  it may be necessary to seek increases in rates 
as a result the company s future financial position and results of operations will be affected by the regulated subsidiaries ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief  if requested 
the revised estimated primary cash requirements for and the actual primary cash requirements for  excluding requirements for fuel liabilities and short term borrowings  are as follows millions of dollars property additions and construction expenditures  net of allowance for funds used during construction nuclear fuel expenditures investments maturing obligations  redemptions and sinking and purchase fund requirements total approximately percent of total cash requirements after payment of dividends was provided from internal sources in as compared to percent in the company anticipates that its cash requirements of million will be met through internally generated funds approximately percent  after payment of dividends  and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness 
sales of additional equity securities may also occur 
the company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the next months and for the foreseeable future 
scana and psnc each have in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities 
at december  scana had registered with the sec and available for issuance billion under this program  the proceeds of which may be used to refinance indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of psnc  to fund additional business activities in nonutility subsidiaries  to reduce short term debt or for general corporate purposes 
on february  psnc registered million of medium term notes with the sec

the company s electric and natural gas businesses are seasonal in nature  with the primary demand for electricity being experienced during summer and winter and the primary demand for natural gas being experienced during winter 
as a result of the significant increase during the latter half of in the cost to the company of natural gas and the colder than normal weather experienced in december  the company experienced significant increases in its working capital requirements  contributing to the need for the financings by scana and psnc in early described above 
without the consent of at least a majority of the total voting power of sce g s preferred stock  sce g may not issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if  after such issue or assumption  the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of sce g s secured indebtedness and capital and surplus  however  no such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal  interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes

on september  sce g announced a million gas turbine generator project in aiken county  south carolina 
two combined cycle turbines will burn natural gas to produce megawatts of new electric generation and use exhaust heat to replace coal fired steam that powers two existing megawatt turbines at the urquhart generating station 
the turbine project is scheduled to be completed by june on october  ferc notified sce g of its agreement with sce g s plan to reinforce lake murray dam in order to maintain the lake in case of an extreme earthquake 
sce g and ferc have been discussing possible reinforcement alternatives for the dam over the past several years as part of sce g s ongoing hydroelectric operating license with ferc 
until discussions are concluded it is not possible to finalize the cost of the project  however  it is possible that the costs could range up to million 
although any costs incurred by sce g are expected to be recoverable through electric rates  sce g also is exploring alternative sources of funding 
the project is expected to be completed in on october  summer station was removed from service for a planned maintenance and refueling outage scheduled to last days 
during initial inspection activities  plant personnel discovered a small leak coming from a hole in a weld in a primary coolant system pipe 
sce g performed extensive ultrasonic testing of similar welds in the cooling system  which confirmed that the problem was limited to this single weld 
a root cause analysis determined that the cause of the crack was primary water stress corrosion cracking 
the repair involved cutting out a twelve inch long spool of the pipe  which included the entire weld  and installing a new spool piece 
repairs have been completed and the integrity of the new welds have been verified through extensive testing 
the plant was returned to service in march the nrc was closely involved throughout this process and approved sce g s actions to repair the crack  as well as the restart schedule 
sce g will continue to monitor primary coolant system pipes during the next outage  scheduled for spring of sce g recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of to expense repair costs to date 
additional costs that may be recorded in the first quarter of are not expected to be material 
the cost of replacement power is expected to be recovered through sce g s electric fuel adjustment clause 
in january sce g s megawatt coal fired cope generating station was taken out of service due to an electrical ground in the generator 
the unit is expected to be returned to service in spring the cost of replacement power is expected to be recovered through sce g s fuel adjustment clause 
scana and westvaco each own a percent interest in cogen south llc cogen 
cogen was formed to build and operate a cogeneration facility at westvaco s kraft division paper mill in north charleston  south carolina 
the facility began operations in march on september  the contractor in charge of construction filed suit in circuit court seeking approximately million from cogen  alleging that it incurred construction cost overruns relating to the facility and that the construction contract provides for recovery of these costs 
in addition to cogen  westvaco  sce g and scana were also named as defendants in the suit 
scana and the other defendants believe the suit is without merit and are mounting an appropriate defense 
scana does not believe that the resolution of this issue will have a material impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental matters the clean air act caa required electric utilities to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide substantially by the year these requirements were phased in over two periods 
the first phase had a compliance date of january  and the second  january  the company s facilities did not require modifications to meet the requirements of phase i 
the company is meeting the phase ii requirements through the burning of natural gas and or lower sulfur coal in its generating units and the purchase and use of sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
low nitrogen oxide burners have been installed to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions to the levels required by phase ii 
the epa has indicated that it will propose regulations for stricter limits on mercury and other toxic pollutants generated by coal fired plants by december and will begin developing these regulations shortly 
sce g and genco filed compliance plans with dhec related to phase ii sulfur dioxide requirements in and phase ii oxides of nitrogen nox requirements in   and the company currently estimates that air emissions control equipment will require capital expenditures of million over the period to retrofit existing facilities  with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million per year 
to meet compliance requirements for the years through  the company anticipates additional capital expenditures of approximately million 
in october the epa issued a final rule requiring states  including south carolina  to modify their state implementation plans sip to address the issue of nox pollution 
on may  a federal appeals court delayed indefinitely the implementation of the rule 
on march  the court affirmed the epa s nox rule for the affected states 
south carolina was subsequently ordered to amend its sip to achieve significant nox reductions 
south carolina failed to submit a revised sip as required under the caa  and the epa has issued official notice to south carolina and a number of other states to comply 
while not final  south carolina has proposed nox reductions that would require the company to install pollution control equipment 
because dhec had not amended its sip as of december  to set out or allocate any nox reductions  it is not possible to estimate what  if any  capital expenditures will be required to comply with any potential mandated reductions 
the epa has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the industry and the department of justice doj has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the caa 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section of the caa  and were issued notices of violation prior to the suits 
the basis for these suits is the claim by the epa that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
the company and sce g have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
similar requests have been sent to a number of other utilities nationwide 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  particularly an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each activity represents prudent practice regularly performed throughout the utility industry as necessary to maintain the operational efficiency and safety of equipment 
as such  the company believes that each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance and that the epa is changing  or attempting to change through enforcement actions  the intent and meaning of its regulations 
the company also believes that  even if some of the activities in question were found not to qualify for the routine exemption  there were no increases either in annual emissions or in the maximum hourly emissions achievable at any of the units caused by any of the activities 
the regulations provide an exemption for increased hours of operation or production rate and for increases in emissions resulting from demand growth 
it is possible that the epa will eventually commence enforcement actions against sce g relative to those plants 
the epa has the authority to seek penalties for the alleged violations in question at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also would seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants as well 
the company believes that the epa s and doj s claims are without merit  and that any enforcement action  up to and including a lawsuit resulting from this issue  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the federal clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require various levels of treatment for each waste water discharge 
under this act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all and renewed for nearly all of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program in monitoring and controlling thermal discharges and strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company has been developing compliance plans for these initiatives 
amendments to the clean water act proposed in congress include several provisions which  if passed  could prove costly to sce g and genco 
these include  but are not limited to  limitations to mixing zones and the implementation of technology based standards 
in december sce g entered into a consent order with dhec related to a malfunction of the waste water treatment facility at hagood station 
the order requires sce g to correct the violation 
the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and assess current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate primarily to regulated operations 
such amounts are deferred and amortized with recovery provided through rates 
sce g has also recovered portions of its environmental liabilities through settlements with various insurance carriers  including all amounts previously deferred for its electric operations 
sce g expects to recover all deferred amounts related to its gas operations by december deferred amounts  net of amounts recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters 
o in september the epa notified sce g  the city of charleston and the charleston housing authority of their potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of the calhoun park area site in charleston  south carolina 
this site encompasses approximately acres and includes properties which were locations for industrial operations  including a wood preserving creosote plant  one of sce g s decommissioned mgps  properties owned by the national park service and the city of charleston and private properties 
the site has not been placed on the national priorities list  but may be added in the future 
the prps negotiated an administrative order by consent for the conduct of a remedial investigation feasibility study and a corresponding scope of work 
field work began in november  and the epa approved a remedial investigation report in february and a feasibility study report in june in july the epa approved sce g s removal action work plan for soil excavation 
sce g completed phase one of the removal action work plan in at a cost of approximately million 
phase two  which cost approximately million  included excavation and installation of several permanent barriers to mitigate coal tar seepage 
on september  a record of decision was issued which sets forth the epa s view of the extent of each prp s responsibility for site contamination and the level to which the site must be remediated 
sce g estimates that the record of decision will result in costs of approximately million  of which approximately million remains 
on january  the epa issued a unilateral administrative order for remedial design and remedial action directing sce g to design and carry out a plan of remediation for the calhoun park site 
sce g submitted a comprehensive remedial design work plan rdwp on december  and proceeded with implementation pending agency approval 
the rdwp was approved by the epa in july  and its implementation continues 
in october the city of charleston and sce g settled all environmental claims the city may have had against sce g involving the calhoun park area for a payment of million over four years by sce g to the city 
sce g is recovering the amount of the settlement  which does not encompass site assessment and cleanup costs  through rates in the same manner as other amounts accrued for site assessments and cleanup as discussed above 
as part of the environmental settlement  sce g constructed an  space parking garage on the calhoun park site construction was completed in april and transferred the facility to the city in exchange for a million  year municipal bond collaterized by revenues from  and a mortgage on  the parking garage 
o sce g owns three other decommissioned mgp sites which contain residues of by product chemicals 
for the site located in sumter  south carolina  effective september   sce g entered into a remedial action plan contract with dhec pursuant to which it agreed to undertake a full site investigation and remediation under the oversight of dhec 
site investigation and characterization are proceeding according to schedule 
upon selection and successful implementation of a site remedy  dhec will give sce g a certificate of completion  and a covenant not to sue 
for the site located in florence  south carolina  sce g entered into a similar remedial action plan contract with dhec effective september  sce g is continuing to investigate the remaining site in columbia  and is monitoring the nature and extent of residual contamination 
in addition  psnc owns  or has owned  all or portions of seven sites in north carolina on which mgps were formerly operated 
intrusive investigation including drilling  sampling and analysis has begun at only one site  and the remaining sites have been evaluated using historical records and observations of current site conditions 
these evaluations have revealed that mgp residuals are present or suspected at several of the sites 
the north carolina department of environment and natural resources has recommended that no further action be taken with respect to one site 
an environmental due diligence review of psnc conducted in february estimated that the cost to remediate the remaining sites would range between million to million 
during the second quarter of  the review was finalized and the estimated liability was recorded 
psnc is unable to determine the rate at which costs may be incurred over this time period 
the estimated cost range has not been discounted to present value 
psnc s associated actual costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors  such as actual site conditions  third party claims and recoveries from other prps 
an order of the ncuc dated may  authorized deferral accounting for all costs associated with the investigation and remediation of mgp sites 
at december  psnc has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of million  which reflects the minimum amount of the range  net of shared cost recovery from other prps 
amounts incurred to date are not material 
management intends to request recovery of additional mgp cleanup costs not recovered from other prps in future rate case filings  and believes that all costs incurred will be recoverable in gas rates 
regulatory matters south carolina electric gas company on july  the psc issued an order approving sce g s request for an out of period adjustment to increase the cost of gas component of its rates for natural gas service from cents per therm to cents per therm  effective with the first billing cycle in august as part of its regularly scheduled annual review of gas costs  the psc issued an order on november  which further increased the cost of gas component to cents per therm  effective with the first billing cycle in november on december  the psc issued an order approving sce g s request for another out of period adjustment to increase the cost of gas component to cents per therm  effective with the first billing cycle in january in march the psc approved sce g s request to decrease the cost of gas component to cents per therm  effective with the first billing cycle in march on july  the psc approved sce g s request to implement lower depreciation rates for its gas operations 
the new rates were effective retroactively to january  and will result in a reduction in annual depreciation expense of approximately million 
on september  the psc approved an accelerated capital recovery plan for sce g s cope generating station 
the plan was implemented beginning january  for a three year period 
the psc approved an accelerated capital recovery methodology wherein sce g may increase depreciation of its cope generating station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates 
the amount of the accelerated depreciation will be determined by sce g based on the level of revenues and operating expenses  not to exceed million annually without the approval of the psc 
any unused portion of the million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year 
as of december  no accelerated depreciation has been recorded 
the accelerated capital recovery plan will be accomplished through existing customer rates 
on december  the psc issued an order requiring sce g to reduce retail electric rates on a prospective basis 
the psc acted in response to sce g reporting that it earned a percent return on common equity for its retail electric operations for the months ended september  this return on common equity exceeded sce g s authorized return of percent by percent  or million  primarily as a result of record heat experienced during the summer 
the order required prospective rate reductions on a per kilowatt hour basis  based on actual retail sales for the months ended september  on january  the psc denied sce g s motion for reconsideration  ruled that no further rate action was required  and reaffirmed sce g s authorized return on equity of percent 
the rate reductions were placed into effect with the first billing cycle of january on january  the psc issued an order granting sce g an increase in retail electric rates which were fully implemented by january the psc authorized a return on common equity of percent 
the psc also approved establishment of a storm damage reserve account capped at million to be collected through rates over a ten year period 
additionally  the psc approved accelerated recovery of a significant portion of sce g s electric regulatory assets excluding deferred income tax assets and the remaining transition obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions  changing the amortization periods to allow recovery by the end of the year sce g s request to shift  for rate making purposes  approximately million of depreciation reserves from transmission and distribution assets to nuclear production assets was also approved 
the consumer advocate and two other intervenors appealed certain issues in the order initially to the circuit court  which affirmed the psc s decisions  and subsequently  to the supreme court 
in march  sce g  the psc  the consumer advocate and one of the other intervenors reached an agreement that provided for the reversal of the shift in depreciation reserves and the dismissal of the appeal of all other issues 
the psc also authorized sce g to adjust depreciation rates that had been approved in the rate order for its electric transmission  distribution and nuclear production properties to eliminate the effect of the depreciation reserve shift and to retroactively apply such depreciation rates to february as a result  a one time reduction in depreciation expense of million was recorded in march the agreement does not affect retail electric rates 
the ferc had previously rejected the transfer of depreciation reserves for rates subject to its jurisdiction 
in september the supreme court affirmed the circuit court s rulings on the issues contested by the remaining intervenor 
in the psc issued an order approving sce g s request to recover through a billing surcharge to its gas customers the costs of environmental cleanup at the sites of former mgps 
the billing surcharge is subject to annual review and provides for the recovery of substantially all actual and projected site assessment and cleanup costs and environmental claims settlements for sce g s gas operations that had previously been deferred 
in november  as a result of the annual review  the psc approved sce g s request to maintain the billing surcharge at 
per therm to provide for the recovery of the remaining balance of million

public service company of north carolina  incorporated a state expansion fund  established by the north carolina general assembly in and funded by refunds from psnc s interstate pipeline transporters  provides financing for expansion into areas that otherwise would not be economically feasible to serve 
on december  psnc filed an application with the ncuc to extend natural gas service to madison  jackson and swain counties  north carolina 
pursuant to state statutes  the ncuc required psnc to forfeit its exclusive franchises to serve six counties in western north carolina effective january  because these counties were not receiving any natural gas service 
madison  jackson and swain counties were included in the forfeiture order 
on june  the ncuc approved psnc s requests for reinstatement of its exclusive franchises for madison  jackson and swain counties and disbursement of up to million from psnc s expansion fund for this project 
psnc estimates that the cost of this project will be approximately million 
on december  the ncuc issued an order approving the acquisition of psnc by the company 
as specified in the ncuc order  psnc reduced its rates by approximately million in august  will reduce rates another million in august and has agreed to a five year moratorium on general rate cases 
general rate relief can be obtained during this period to recover costs associated with materially adverse governmental actions and force majeure events 
on february  the ncuc approved psnc s application to use expansion funds to extend natural gas service into alexander county and authorized disbursements from the fund of approximately million based upon budgeted construction cost of approximately million 
most of alexander county lies within psnc s certificated service territory and did not previously have natural gas service 
the project was completed and customers began receiving natural gas service in march on october  the ncuc issued an order in psnc s general rate case filed in april the order  effective november   granted psnc additional revenue of million and allowed a percent overall rate of return on psnc s net utility investment 
it also approved the continuation of the weather normalization adjustment and rider d mechanisms and full margin transportation rates 
psnc s rider d rate mechanism authorizes the recovery of all prudently incurred gas costs from customers on a monthly basis
