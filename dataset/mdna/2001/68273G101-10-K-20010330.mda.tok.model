item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading application service provider for internet banking  bill payment and e financial services to financial institutions 
we provide our clients a cost effective outsourced service  branded in their name  by seamlessly integrating internet banking  electronic bill payment  and other e financial services into a single vendor  end to end solution 
as part of our services  we provide customer support through our call center  marketing services  web site design  implementation and other services 
we derive revenue from long term service contracts with our financial institution clients  who pay us recurring fees based primarily on the number of their retail customers enrolled and transaction volumes  as well as an up front implementation fee 
our financial institution clients typically subsidize some or all of our fees when reselling our services to their retail customers  as they derive significant potential benefits including account retention  delivery and paper cost savings  account consolidation and cross selling of other products 
as a network based service provider  we have made substantial up front investments in infrastructure 
we believe our financial performance and operating leverage will be based primarily on increasing retail customer subscriptions and transaction volumes over a relatively fixed cost base 
our current sources of revenue are from service fees  implementation and other revenues 
we expect that our primary source of revenue growth will come from service fees as a result of continued growth of retail customers 
service fees 
our primary source of revenues is derived from recurring monthly fees by providing services which include banking and bill payment  customer service  consumer marketing  information reporting  and administrative services  to financial institution clients  typically based on the number of enrolled retail customers 
these services are priced on a monthly per retail customer basis  and in some cases  on a transaction basis 
we recognize these revenues from services as provided 
implementation and other revenues 
we generate revenue from implementation of our fully integrated services to our financial institution clients 
implementation fees are paid on a one time basis at signing 
we previously recognized nonrefundable implementation fees as revenue under the percentage of completion method as certain milestone output measures were completed 
during the year ended december   effective january   we adopted sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab and changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable implementation fees for all contracts to recognize such fees over the contract term as the services are provided  which typically range from one to five years 
we also derive revenue from sales of related enabling products and software at fixed prices  including our pc software and customer service software 
these have not been a significant source of revenue and continue to decline as retail customers migrate to the web service 
effective january   we discontinued support of our proprietary pc software 
historically  the majority of our resources have been directed to creating our proprietary system 
our proprietary system enables us to provide a broad range of services to our financial institution clients including online banking  bill paying  and access to complementary financial services supported by our customer call center  marketing services and other support services 
while investment to date has been significant  we believe the infrastructure we have built will enable us to support our anticipated growth over the next several years with only nominal incremental cost for additional retail customers 
financial condition since our founding  we have incurred high costs to create our infrastructure  while generating low revenues 
as a result we have historically experienced large operating losses and negative cash flow 
at december  we had accumulated deficits of million  cash and investments of million and net property and equipment of million 
we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and debt securities 
ongoing working capital requirements will primarily consist of personnel costs related to enhancing and maintaining our system 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the near future 
cash and investments in available for sale securities were million as of december  and proceeds from our initial public offering on june   net of offering costs from the offering  totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had used million of the proceeds for the repayment of debt and million for working capital 
as of december   notes payable increased to million as a result of the issuance of convertible subordinated notes on september  net of debt issuance costs  we received proceeds of million which is held in cash and investments 
interest payment dates are april and october  commencing april our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects for success and our revenue and profitability potential is unproven

we derive revenues from service fees  implementation and other revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in service fees which were largely recurring and driven by an increase of in the number of retail customers and an increase of in the number of transactions offset by lower service fees per user measured at december  and december  additionally  implementation and other revenues increased to million as a result of increases in the number of financial institutions with whom we have contracted and enabled on our services
