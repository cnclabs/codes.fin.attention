item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview onyx is a specialized consumer finance company engaged in the purchase  origination  securitization and servicing of contracts originated by franchised and select independent automobile dealerships in the united states 
the company focuses its efforts on acquiring contracts that are collateralized by late model used and  to a lesser extent  new automobiles  that are entered into with purchasers whom the company believes have a favorable credit profile 
since commencing the purchase of contracts in february  the company has acquired more than billion in contracts and currently has an active dealer base of over  dealerships 
the company has expanded its operations from a single office in california to auto finance centers serving many regions of the united states 
the company generates revenues primarily through the purchase  origination  warehousing  subsequent securitization and ongoing servicing of contracts 
the company earns net interest income on contracts held during the warehousing period 
upon the securitization and sale of contracts  the company recognizes a gain on sale of contracts  receives future excess cash flows generated by owner and grantor trusts  and earns fees from servicing the securitized contracts 
the following table illustrates the changes in the company s contract acquisition volume  total revenue  securitization activity and serviced portfolio during the past three fiscal years 
selected financial information for the years ended december  dollars in thousands contracts purchased during year    average monthly purchases during the year    gain on sale of contracts    total revenue    contracts securitized during the year    serviced portfolio at year end    total revenue is comprised of net interest income  servicing fee income and gain on sale of contracts 
contracts purchased and serviced portfolio since its inception  the company has experienced continuing growth in its purchased volume of contracts 
acquisition volume for the year ended december   was billion compared to billion for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
this growth in acquisition volume is attributable primarily to the opening of two new auto finance centers in the first half of contract purchases during the second half of the year slowed as management discontinued its branch expansion efforts after the second quarter 
management believes that the current market environment has become irrational due to increases in the offering of contract terms over months on used cars and the increasing dollar amount of loan proceeds offered in excess of the value of the related financed vehicle 
these factors  as well as the anticipated slowing of the economic environment  were considered by management and the decision was made to reduce the rate of growth in the company 
management has focused its efforts on reviewing and utilizing automation tools to assist in the underwriting and credit review processes 
the resulting enhancements to the front end credit decision processes are expected to improve not only the speed of the decision but also the ability of our credit officers to make a decision that is acceptable 
management has also enhanced the post funding review process of the underwriting decision so that the process is more automated 
management will return to its expansion plans when it determines that the market environment has improved 
the company s increase in contract acquisition volume has resulted in the growth in the company s serviced portfolio 
the serviced portfolio at december   was billion compared to billion at december   an increase of 
results of operations years ended december   and the company had net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income from to is attributable to the interest rate spread compression experienced on contracts securitized during the year coupled with an increase in the loan loss reserve rate 
off balance sheet reserves increased to of the sold portion of the portfolio at december  compared to at december  the weighted average gross spread for securitizations executed during the current year was compared to in the increase in net income from to is attributable to a increase in the dollar volume of contracts securitized  resulting in a increase in gains on sales  higher servicing fee income due to an increase in the serviced portfolio and improvements in the cost structure of the company 
net interest income 
net interest income consists primarily of the difference between the finance revenue earned on contracts held on the balance sheet during the warehousing period and the interest costs associated with the company s borrowings to purchase such contracts 
net interest income declined by to million for  from million during  and million during the reduction in was principally due to the increase in the cost of warehouse borrowings during the year and a reduction in the average amount of contracts held for sale 
the weighted average cost of warehouse borrowings increased to for  compared to and for and respectively 
due to the prefunding structure of the securitizations executed during the current year  the average amount of contracts held for sale during decreased to million  compared to million and million in and respectively 
a prefunded securitization reduces the time period that contracts are held for sale 
a prefunded structure allows the company to mitigate its interest rate risk in a rising rate environment by locking in the rate for future fixed rate contract acquisitions 
additionally  it permits the company to time its securitizations earlier in the quarter when transaction volumes are lower  thus enabling the company to take advantage of market conditions 
servicing fee income 
contractual servicing is earned at a rate of per annum on the outstanding principal balance of contracts securitized 
excess servicing income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold and the performance of those contracts 
servicing fee income is related to the size of the serviced portfolio and also includes investment interest  late fees  extension fees  document fees and other fees charged to customer accounts 
servicing fee income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the size of the average sold portion of the serviced portfolio 
for the year ended december   the size of the average sold portion of the serviced portfolio increased to billion from billion from million for the same period in and  respectively 
gain on sale of contracts 
the company computes a gain on sale with respect to contracts securitized based on the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received from such contracts using a market discount rate 
gain on sale is recorded as a credit enhancement asset on the statement of financial condition  and is amortized against servicing income over the life of the contracts 
the gain recorded in the statement of income is adjusted for prepaid dealer participation  issuance costs and the effect of hedging activities 
the gains on sales of contracts is affected by the amount of contracts securitized and the net interest rate spread on those contracts 
the following table illustrates the net interest rate spread for each of the company s securitizations securitization transactions remaining weighted weighted balance at average average original december  contract investor gross net securitization balance rate rate spread spread dollars in thousands grantor trust  paid in full grantor trust  paid in full grantor trust  paid in full grantor trust  paid in full grantor trust  paid in full grantor trust  paid in full grantor trust  paid in full grantor trust   grantor trust   grantor trust   grantor trust   a owner trust   b owner trust   c owner trust   a owner trust   b owner trust   c owner trust   d owner trust   a owner trust   b owner trust   c owner trust   d owner trust   total   as of issue date

difference between weighted average contract rate and weighted average investor rate  net of unearned dealer participation payments  underwriting costs  other issuance costs  servicing fees  estimated credit losses  ongoing financial guarantee insurance policy premiums  and the hedging gain or loss 
the company assumes an average prepayment speed of per month of the original number of contracts in the original pool balance abs  a discount rate ranging from to above the weighted average investor rate  and utilizes a lifetime loss rate ranging from to of the original balance  for all remaining securitizations 
the company completed four securitizations totaling billion during the year ended december   resulting in gains on sale of contracts of million  compared to four securitizations totaling billion  resulting in gains on sale of contracts totaling million  and four securitizations totaling million and a whole loan sale of million during the year ended december   resulting in gains on sale of contracts of million 
these reductions in gains are in line with management s objective to become less reliant on the initial gain on sale accounting for its reported financial results 
the reduction in the gain as a percentage of the contracts securitized was attributable to a combined decrease in net interest rate spreads and an increase in credit loss assumptions during the year ended december  annual loss assumptions for the second  third and fourth quarter securitizations of were increased from to to counter increased losses in the serviced portfolio 
the average net interest rate spread on the securitizations was compared to in and in the net interest rate spread is the difference between the weighted average contract rate of the securitized assets  and the weighted average investor rate inclusive of all costs related to the transaction 
interest rate spread is affected by product mix  general market conditions and overall market interest rates 
the risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations are partially reduced through hedging activities 
during the first quarter of  the company securitized the residual cash flows from of its then outstanding securitizations and recorded a loss of approximately  which approximated the costs in connection with the transaction 
the proceeds of this transaction were used to pay down two of the company s residual financing facilities and pay off another residual financing facility 
provision for credit losses 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover anticipated losses on the contracts held on the statement of financial condition 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the contracts held on the statement of financial condition or by the sale of contracts held on the statement of financial condition 
the level of the allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held on the statement of financial condition  and historical loss trends 
when the company sells contracts in a securitization transaction  it reduces its allowance for credit losses and factors potential losses into its calculations of gain on sale 
the company believes that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb potential losses in the owned portfolio 
the provision for credit losses was thousand during compared to million during and million during the reduction in provision for credit losses in relative to was due primarily to a reduction in the year over year net change in contracts held for sale 
at year end  contracts held for sale decreased by million over year end  while at year end  contracts held for sale increased million over year end salaries and benefits expense 
the company incurred salary and benefit expenses of million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in order to support the growth of its operations and the serviced portfolio  the number of employees increased from at december   to at december  and to at december  system and servicing expense 
system and servicing expense increased to million  compared to million and million for the years end december   and respectively 
currently  the company uses an external service provider for its loan accounting system 
the charges associated with this provider are directly correlated to the number of contracts serviced by the company 
the company has acquired a loan accounting and collection system  and intends to bring these processes in house in as of december   the company serviced approximately  accounts  compared to approximately  accounts at year end and  accounts at year end the increases in systems and servicing expense also reflect higher consulting fees in connection with the customization of the company s new loan accounting and collection system 
telephone and data line expenses 
telephone and data line expenses remained relatively stable at approximately million from million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although these charges generally increase with the growth of the serviced portfolio  the stability between and was primarily due to renegotiated contracts for long distance rates with certain carriers 
assuming no additional reduction in long distance rates  the company expects these charges to increase relative to the continued growth of the serviced portfolio 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased to million from million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these increases are in line with the company s continued investment in technology and infrastructure to support the growth of the serviced portfolio 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the majority of the increases were due to the growth of the average serviced portfolio from billion to billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  the company opened new auto finance centers during the years ended december   and income taxes 
the company files federal and certain state tax returns as a consolidated group 
tax liabilities from the consolidated returns are allocated in accordance with a tax sharing agreement based on the relative income or loss of each entity on a stand alone basis 
the effective tax rate for onyx was for through financial condition contracts held for sale contracts held for sale totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the number and principal balance of contracts held for sale is largely dependent upon the timing and size of the company s securitizations 
credit enhancement assets credit enhancement assets consisted of the following as of december  dollars in thousands trust receivable   risa   total   trust receivable represents servicer advances and initial deposits in spread accounts 
risa consists of the estimated present value of future servicing cash flows from related securitizations 
future servicing cash flows are computed by taking into account certain assumptions principally regarding prepayments  losses and servicing costs 
these discounted cash flows are then discounted at a market based rate until they are released from the spread account and received by the company 
the balance is then amortized against actual servicing fee income on a monthly basis 
the following table provides historical data regarding the risa 
included in risa is restricted cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

at december   delinquencies represented of the amount of contracts in its serviced portfolio compared to at december   and at december  net charge offs as a percentage of the average serviced portfolio were for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the levels of delinquencies at december   increased over december   primarily due to the transfer of certain east coast accounts to the hazelwood  missouri  collection center before the staff was fully trained and capable of handling the additional work load 
the increase in loan losses from to is attributable to the rise in delinquencies 
in each of the last three years  management has increased its off balance sheet reserves as a percentage of the serviced portfolio sold 
reserves have increased from at december   to at december   to at december  off balance sheet reserves are those reserves established upon the sale of contracts to the grantor and owner trusts in connection with securitized contracts

the capital resources available to the company include i interest income during the warehousing period  ii servicing fees  iii releases from spread accounts  iv settlements of hedging transactions  v sales of contracts in securitizations  and vi borrowings under its credit facilities 
management believes that the resources available to the company provide the needed capital to fund the anticipated expansion of the company  contract purchases  and investments in origination and servicing capabilities 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used for the year ended december  and million used in the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the current year was primarily due to the securitization of the residual cash flows from of the company s then outstanding securitizations in march  the proceeds of which were used to pay down two of the company s residual financing facilities and pay off a third residual financing facility 
cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december   and million for the twelve months ended december  higher than normal capital acquisitions during related to a general reduction in the use of the company s capital lease lines and the relocation of the company s corporate headquarters contributed to the increase during compared to and cash used in financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million provided by financing activities in and million in the reduction in the company s outstanding residual financing facilities in connection with the securitization of its residual cash flows and the repurchase a portion of the company s outstanding common stock led to the overall increase in cash used in financing activities 
cp facilities as of december   the company was party to two primary contract warehousing programs the cp facilities  one a million facility with triple a one funding corporation triple a  and the other a million facility with park avenue receivables corporation parco 
two of the company s special purpose subsidiaries  onyx acceptance financial corporation finco for the triple a facility and onyx acceptance receivables corporation recco for the parco facility  are the borrowers under the cp facilities 
the cp facilities are used to fund the purchase or origination of contracts 
triple a and parco are both rated commercial paper asset backed conduits sponsored by mbia insurance corporation mbia and the chase manhattan bank chase  respectively 
mbia provides credit enhancement for both facilities by issuing financial guarantee insurance policies covering all principal and interest obligations owed for the borrowings under the facilities 
the company pledges its contracts held for sale to borrow from triple a and from parco 
the parco facility was renewed in august  and expires in august  but may be renewed at the option of the lender 
the triple a facility was renewed in september the capacity of this line was reduced by million to million 
the reduction was the result of a merger of one of the liquidity banks  and is not considered significant to ongoing operations  as the company has excess borrowing capacity 
this facility will expire in september but may be renewed at the option of the lender 
the company finances dealer participation payments and daily operations principally through credit facilities collateralized by its retained interest in securitized assets  as well as through proceeds from subordinated debt offerings 
the residual lines the company  through fundco  has three residual financing facilities a million facility with merrill lynch international mli executed in may  which replaced a prior residual financing facility with merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc mlmci  and a million line with salomon smith barney realty corporation sbrc 
the company also executed a residual financing facility in october in the amount of million with credit suisse first boston europe limited  as buyer csfb europe  and credit suisse first boston corporation  as agent csfb 
the line will be used as an additional liquidity source to fund ongoing operations 
the sbrc facility together with the facility with mli  and the newest facility with csfb europe described above are sometimes referred to herein as the residual lines 
the residual lines are used by the company to finance operating requirements 
the lines utilize collateral based formulas that set borrowing availability to a percentage of the value of excess cash flow to be received from certain securitizations 
the facility provided by mli has a one year term expiring in may  but may be renewed at the option of the lender 
each loan under the sbrc line or the csfb europe line matures one year after the date of the loan  the company expects each loan to be renewed at term 
subordinated debt as of december   the company had outstanding approximately million of subordinated debt 
a portion of this amount is being amortized through february during the second quarter of  the company issued million in subordinated debt with a stated interest rate of and a maturity of june the facilities and lines above contain affirmative  negative and financial covenants typical of such credit facilities 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of december  stock repurchase on may   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to  of the company s common stock  based on its view that the market value of the company was not adequately reflected in the share price as traded on the nasdaq national market 
as of december    shares had been repurchased under the program for an aggregate amount of million 
hedging and interest rate risk management the company employs a hedging strategy that is intended to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations and which historically has involved the execution of forward interest rate swaps or use of a pre funding structure for the company s securitizations 
the company is not required to maintain collateral on the outstanding hedging program  until the point where the fair value declines below million 
securitizations regular securitizations are an integral part of the company s business plan because they allow the company to increase its liquidity  provide for redeployment of its capital and reduce risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the company has developed a securitization program that involves selling interests in pools of its contracts to investors through the public issuance of aaa aaa rated asset backed securities 
the company completed four aaa aaa rated publicly underwritten asset backed securitizations in the amount of billion in during the first quarter of  the company securitized the residual cash flows from of its then outstanding securitizations 
the proceeds of this transaction were used by the company to pay down two residual financing facilities and pay off another residual financing facility 
the net proceeds of these securitizations are used to pay down outstanding indebtedness incurred under the company s credit facilities to purchase contracts  thereby creating availability for the purchase of additional contracts 
since  the company has securitized billion of its contracts in separate transactions 
in each of its securitizations  the company has sold its contracts to a newly formed grantor or owner trust which issued pass through certificates or notes in an amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
to improve the level of profitability from the sale of securitized contracts  the company arranges for credit enhancement to achieve an improved credit rating on the asset backed securities issued 
this credit enhancement has taken the form of a financial guaranty policy the financial guarantee insurance policy insuring the payment of principal and interest due on the asset backed securities 
the company receives servicing fees for its duties relating to the accounting for and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the future excess cash flows arising from the trusts 
generally  the company sells the contracts at face value and without recourse  except that certain representations and warranties with respect to the contracts are provided by the company as the servicer and finco as the seller to the trusts 
gains on sale of contracts arising from securitizations provide a significant portion of the company s revenues 
several factors affect the company s ability to complete securitizations of its contracts  including conditions in the securities markets generally  conditions in the asset backed securities market specifically  the credit quality of the company s portfolio of contracts and the company s ability to obtain credit enhancement 
in the first quarter of  the company securitized contracts in the amount of million 
interest rate exposure and hedging the company is able through the use of varying maturities on advances from the cp facilities to lock in rates during the warehousing period  when in management s judgment it is appropriate to limit interest rate exposure during such warehousing period see risk factors interest rate risk 
the company has the ability to move rates upward in response to rising borrowing costs because the company currently does not originate loans near the maximum rates permitted by law 
further  the company employs a hedging strategy which primarily consists of the execution of forward interest rate swaps 
these hedges are entered into by the company in numbers and amounts which generally correspond to the anticipated principal amount of the related securitization 
gains and losses relative to these hedges are recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain on sale of the contracts 
the company has only used counterparties with investment grade debt ratings from national rating agencies for its hedging transactions 
management monitors the company s hedging activities on a frequent basis to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the company s hedging strategy requires estimates by management of monthly contract acquisition volume and timing of its securitizations 
if such estimates are materially inaccurate  then the company s gain on sales of contracts and results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by senior management based upon the amount of contracts purchased and the interest rate environment 
senior management currently expects to hedge substantially all of its contracts pending securitization 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative contracts  and for hedging activities 
the new standard requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and that those instruments be measured at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedging instrument 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  unrealized gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the statement is effective in the first quarter of year the company is presently assessing the effect of sfas on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
management expects the adoption of these new accounting standards will result in a one time cumulative after tax reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately  as of january  the adoption will also impact assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet 
in july  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
the task force reached a consensus that the holder should recognize the excess of all cash flows attributable to the beneficial interest estimated at the acquisition transaction date the transaction date over the initial investment the accretable yield as interest income over the life of the beneficial interest using the effective yield method 
if the holder of the beneficial interest is the transferor  the initial investment would be the allocated carrying amount after application of the relative fair value allocation method required by statement the amount of accretable yield should not be displayed in the balance sheet 
the task force further reached a consensus that the holder of a beneficial interest should continue to update the estimate of cash flows over the life of the beneficial interest 
the consensus in this issue should be applied to the accounting for interest income and impairment of beneficial interests in securitization transactions meeting the scope criteria of this issue effective for all fiscal quarter beginning after march the company is presently assessing the effect of issue no 
on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fas this statement replaces fas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
it revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it carries over most of fas s provisions without reconsideration 
this statement provides consistent standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
this statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  this statement is effective for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after december  the company has adopted fas for disclosure purposes and is presently assessing the effect of fas on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
forward looking information the preceding management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  should or continue or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology 
the matters set forth in this annual report on form k constitute cautionary statements identifying important factors with respect to such forward looking statements  including certain risks and uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of its dependence upon the issuance of interest bearing securities and the incurrence of debt to fund its lending activities 
several factors can influence the company s ability to manage interest rate risk 
first  contracts are purchased at fixed interest rates  while the amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustment to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
second  the interest rate demanded by investors in a securitization is a function of prevailing market rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
because the contracts originated by the company have fixed interest rates  the company bears the risk of smaller gross interest rate spreads in the event interest rates increase during the period between the date contracts are purchased and the completion and pricing of securitization transactions 
the company uses several strategies to minimize interest rate risk  including the utilization of derivative financial instruments  the regular sale of contracts and pre funding of securitization transactions 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than the amount of contracts initially sold to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until additional contracts are sold to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  borrowing costs are locked in with respect to the contracts subsequently delivered to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to the subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding 
derivative financial instruments are utilized to manage the gross interest rate spread on the company s securitization transactions 
the company sells fixed rate contracts to the trusts that  in turn  sell fixed rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trust are indexed to rates on us treasury notes with similar average maturities or various london interbank offered rates libor 
the company periodically executes the sale of forward swap agreements to lock in the indexed rate for specific anticipated securitization transactions 
the company utilizes these derivative financial instruments to modify its net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on the company s risk tolerance 
all transactions are entered into for purposes other than trading  and are settled quarterly upon pricing of the securitization 
the company remitted cash payments  net of expenses  of approximately million in  received cash payments net of expenses of million in and made cash payments  net of expenses  of million in to settle forward interest rate swap agreements 
these amounts were included in the gain on sale of contracts in securitization transactions 
cash payments are recovered over time through a higher gross interest rate spread on the related securitization transaction  while cash receipts are offset through a lower gross interest rate spread on the related securitization transaction 
as of december   the company had million of forward interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments by expected maturity date as of december  dollars in thousands 
notional amounts  which are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the agreements  represent average amounts that will be outstanding for each of the years included in the table 
notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by parties and  thus  are not a measure of the company s exposure to loss through its use of the agreements 
years ended december  fair value interest rate swaps average notional amounts s      average interest rate paid average interest rate received variable variable variable variable variable there can be no assurance that the company s strategies will be effective in minimizing interest rate risk or that increases in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the company s profitability
