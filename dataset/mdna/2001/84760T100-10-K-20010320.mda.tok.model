item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview this discussion contains forward looking statements  including statements concerning possible or assumed future results of operations 
you should understand that the factors described below  in addition to those discussed elsewhere  could affect our future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
these factors include material adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets we serve  future regulatory actions and conditions in our operating areas  competition from others in the communications tower industry  the integration of our operations with those of businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future and the realization of the expected benefits  and other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and sec filings 
we are one of the largest wireless tower operators in the united states and a leading provider of outsourced network services to the wireless communications and broadcast industries in the united states and canada 
our businesses include the ownership and leasing of antenna sites on towers  managing rooftop and in building telecommunications access on commercial real estate  network planning and deployment and construction of towers and related facilities 
as of december   we owned  towers as compared to  towers at december  we also own of spectrasite transco communications  ltd  a joint venture with lattice group plc  the former arm of bg group plc that operates britain s natural gas distribution network 
as a result of recent acquisitions  principally the acquisition of  communications towers from nextel communications  inc in april  the planned acquisition of  communications towers from sbc communications  inc and the merger with westower corporation in september  we expect that network services and antenna site leasing will generate most of our revenues 
we believe that our site leasing business will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues and will continue to grow as we increase our network of towers 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million from the year ended december  revenues from site leasing increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of revenues derived from communications towers which we acquired or constructed during and we owned  communications towers at december   as compared to  communications towers at december  the remaining factor contributing to the increase is incremental revenue in for towers that existed as of december  from new co location tenants 
revenues from network services increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of revenue generated from acquisitions in late and in costs of operations increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in costs was primarily attributable to operating costs of the communications towers acquired or constructed during and  acquisitions in late and in and overall growth in operating activities 
costs of operations for site leasing as a percentage of site leasing revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of new towers and higher tower operating expenses partially offset by increased revenues generated from new co location tenants on existing towers 
as our site leasing operations mature we expect that additional tenants on a tower will generate increases in our margins for site leasing and in cash flow because a significant percentage of tower operating costs are fixed and do not increase with additional tenants 
costs of operations for network services as a percentage of network services revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is due to construction activities associated with westower operations that have higher levels of direct costs than site acquisition activities 
we ceased directly providing site acquisition services in late selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is a result of expenses related to additional corporate overhead and field operations to manage and operate the growth of our ongoing operations and acquisition activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of high levels of administrative expenses incurred in associated with site acquisition activities and costs associated with the integration of towers acquired from nextel 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the increased depreciation from towers we have acquired or constructed and amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions 
for the year ended december   we recorded non cash compensation charges of million related to the issuance of stock options and restricted shares of common stock to employees 
we recorded non cash compensation charges of million in the year ended december  related to stock options and restricted shares of common stock issued to employees 
in march  we announced that we would relocate our marketing and administrative operations from little rock  arkansas and birmingham  alabama to our corporate headquarters in cary  north carolina 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring and non recurring charge of million for employee termination and other costs related to the relocation of these activities 
in september  we announced that we would no longer directly provide site acquisition services 
as a result  we recorded restructuring and non recurring charges of million  of which million related to the write off of goodwill associated with the purchase of telesite services  llc and million related to costs of employee severance 
as a result of the factors discussed above  our loss from operations was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  net interest expense increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase reflects additional interest expense due to the issuance of our senior discount notes due in april  our senior discount notes due in march  our senior notes due in march  our senior convertible notes due in november and our senior notes due in december  as well as borrowings under our credit facility

costs of operations for network services as a percentage of network services revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was due to construction activities associated with westower operations that have higher levels of direct costs than our historical site acquisition activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was a result of expenses related to additional corporate overhead and field operations implemented to manage and operate the growth in our ongoing activities and the acquisition of westower

on june   we privately placed million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due prior to july   interest expense on the discount notes will consist solely of non cash accretion of original issue discount and the notes will not require annual cash interest payments 
after such time  the discount notes will have accreted to million and will require semi annual cash interest payments of million 
the discount notes mature on july  on april   we privately placed million aggregate principal amount at maturity of our senior discount notes due prior to april   interest expense on the discount notes will consist solely of non cash accretion of original issue discount and the discount notes will not require annual cash interest payments

furthermore  our credit facility provides for periodic principal and interest payments 
our ability to fund capital expenditures  make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures  primarily to fund the construction and acquisition of additional communications towers 
we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash on hand and anticipated borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  if we make additional acquisitions or pursue other opportunities or if our estimates prove inaccurate  we may seek additional sources of debt or equity capital or reduce the scope of tower construction and acquisition activity 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings or equity or debt financings will be available on terms acceptable to us  in amounts sufficient to service our indebtedness and make anticipated capital expenditures

cash flows for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities were million as compared to million provided by operating activities in the year ended december  the change is primarily attributable to increased working capital needed to support the growing operations of the business partially offset by the favorable cash flow generated from earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization
