active stockholders received 
shares of common stock of webmethods for each share of active common stock  or an aggregate of million shares 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly the financial statements have been retroactively restated as if the merger had occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented 
active had a calendar fiscal year end 
in connection with the retroactive restatement  the financial statements of active were recast to a march year end to conform to webmethods presentation

in connection with this transaction   shares of our common stock were issued and cash of  was paid in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of premier 
in addition  outstanding options to purchase premier capital stock were converted into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock

in connection with this transaction   shares of our common stock were issued and cash of million was paid 
in addition  the outstanding options to purchase translink capital stock were converted into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
acquisition of technology in february  we acquired intelliframe corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of computer network technology corporation intelliframe 
through the acquisition  we acquired intelliframe  certain workflow technology and intelliframe s boston based research and development team 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was million consisting of a cash payment of million and the issuance of  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million on the date of issuance 
the intelliframe workflow technology was purchased with the intent to subsequently integrate certain parts of the technology into a future product 
the efforts required to complete and incorporate the acquired in process research and development include the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to meet its design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
no other significant assets were purchased 
accordingly management has determined the product into which the acquired technology is to be incorporated has not met technological feasibility and as such substantially all of the purchase price was charged to in process research and development during the quarter ended march  revenue we enter into arrangements  which may include the sale of licenses of our integration software  professional services and maintenance or various combinations of each element 
we recognize revenue based on statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop modified sop by requiring revenue to be recognized using the residual method if certain conditions are met 
revenue is recognized based on the residual method when an agreement has been signed by both parties  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable  delivery of the product has occurred and no other significant obligations remain 
historically we have not experienced significant returns or offered exchanges of our products 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the arrangement is analyzed and we allocate a portion of the total fee under the arrangement to the undelivered elements  such as professional services  training and maintenance 
revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the software license  under the residual method 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price the customer is required to pay when the element is sold separately ie hourly time and material rates charged for consulting services when sold separately from a software license and the optional renewal rates charged by us for maintenance arrangements 
for electronic delivery  the product is considered to have been delivered when the access code to download the software from our website and activation key  as applicable  have been provided to the customer 
if an element of the license agreement has not been delivered  revenue for the element is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue is deferred until sufficient objective evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
license revenue amounts allocated to license revenue under the residual method are recognized at the time of delivery of the software when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  if any  and all the other revenue recognition criteria discussed above have been met 

table of contents professional services revenue revenue from professional services is comprised of consulting  implementation services and training 
consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and include services such as installation and building non complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in customized environments 
services are generally separable from the other elements under the arrangement since the performance of the services is not essential to the functionality ie the services do not involve significant production  modification or customization of the software or building complex interfaces of any other element of the transaction 
revenue for professional services and training is recognized when the services are performed 
maintenance revenue maintenance revenue consists primarily of fees for providing when and if available unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term 
maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
costs of revenue our cost of license revenue primarily includes royalties related to third parties software embedded in our products or sold to our customers

interest is payable on the unpaid principal balance at the bank s prime rate 

table of contents we expect to experience growth in our operating expenses  particularly sales and marketing expenses  research and development and customer care  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
as a result  we anticipate that such operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will result in a use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our existing working capital and our amended line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we maintain our funds in money market and certificate of deposit accounts at financial institutions 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our interest earnings on our cash deposits 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing as of march   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to 
table of contents mitigate risks 
however  we do have an investment policy that would allow us to invest in short term and long term investments such as money market instruments and corporate debt securities 
our policy attempts to reduce such risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than twenty four months with a maximum average maturity to our whole portfolio of such investments at twelve months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries located in australia  england  france  germany  japan  the netherlands and singapore 
although we transact business in various foreign countries  settlement amounts are usually based on us currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past  and there is no hedging activity on foreign currencies 
we would not experience a material foreign exchange loss based on a hypothetical adverse change in the price of the euro  great britain pound  singapore dollar  australian dollar  or yen against the us dollar 
consequently  we do not expect that a reduction in the value of such accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of fluctuations in foreign currency could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the us foreign and global economics  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition results of operations and cash flows
