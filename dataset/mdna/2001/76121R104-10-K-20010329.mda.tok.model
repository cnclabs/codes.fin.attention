item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the lawsuit alleged that the bank did not act in a commercially reasonable manner when it seized and liquidated certain collateral that secured the defaulted loans 
in connection with this allegation  the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that all obligations of the plaintiffs to the bank were satisfied and that the bank is not entitled to seek deficiency judgments against the plaintiffs 
based on advice of counsel  management does not believe that the relief sought by the plaintiffs will be granted by the court  and to date it has not 
the lawsuit also alleged that the bank s proposed public auction of the stock of a privately held company was not commercially reasonable 
the stock was owned by the agnews individually  but was pledged by the agnews to the bank as collateral for the defaulted loans 
the lawsuit asked the court to enjoin the public auction that was scheduled on november  no injunction was granted 
the public auction occurred as scheduled on november  and the bank bid for and purchased the stock on that date 
based on advice of counsel  management believes that the public auction was conducted in accordance with applicable law 
thereafter  agm and the agnews amended the lawsuit and generally sought a declaration from the court that certain actions taken by the bank in pursuing liquidation of its various collateral were done so contrary to the requirements of the uniform commercial code of virginia such that they were released from any liability on the various indebtednesses they owe the bank 
the amended pleading also requested unspecified monetary damages 
the bank filed a cross bill seeking judgment against agm and the agnews in the amount of approximately  under the notes and the guaranty as well as for fraud

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the effect of interest rates on the company s profitability  and the adequacy of the company s allowance for future loan losses 
several factors  including the virginia and national economies and the demand for residential mortgage loans may adversely affect the company s ability to achieve expected results 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date of this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included as exhibit of this form k 
results of operations and financial condition the company had net income of  for  a net loss of  for and net income of  for this constituted net basic earnings loss per common share of for  
for and for with the diluted effect of common stock equivalents  earnings loss per common share were for  
for and for the loss for the year ended december  was directly attributable to the  provision for loan losses taken in the third quarter 
this provision for loan loss occurred as a result of credit problems with a significant borrower within the company s asset based lending portfolio  as announced by the company in august the company has exited the asset based lending business  which represented only of the company s total loan portfolio 
in regard to business segment reporting  the company s mortgage banking operations resulted in a net gain before taxes of  for the year ended december  and a net loss before income taxes of  for the year ended december   as compared to net income before income taxes of  for the year ended december  the operating loss in was the result of the reorganization of the mortgage division and decreased loan origination volume  caused by a general increase in interest rates and the reorganization of the mortgage operation in at december   of total loans were due in one year or less 
floating rate loans with maturities of one year or less represented of total loans  and the remainder of loans had fixed rates 
average loans  net of unearned income  to average deposits were  and in  and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income  before provision for loan losses  increased by in over to  and in over to  the increase in net interest income was closely proportionate with the increase in average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during during  due to the continued expansion of commercial lending activities  average loans increased to  due to the competitive pricing of the company s deposit products  average total deposits increased to  average funds borrowed from the federal home loan bank and correspondent banks increased by to  in as part of its mortgage banking operations  funds were advanced on behalf of investor banks in settlement of mortgage loans 
average funds advanced in settlement of such loans increased less than to  in average securities increased to  and average interest bearing deposits in other banks increased to  in for a historical analysis of net interest income  see the table entitled average balances  interest income and expenses  and average yields and rates in part i item of this form k 
for an analysis of the potential for a change in interest rates to impact the ability of the bank to generate future net interest income  see the table entitled maturing or repricing in part i item of this form k 
this is frequently referred to as the gap analysis  which analyzes the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities for the repricing maturity periods indicated 
refer to item a for additional information 
as can be seen from the historical analysis and the gap analysis  the company is in a liability sensitive position 
in a period of rising interest rates  the company is positioned to increase future net interest income 
conversely  in a period of declining interest rates the company will be in a position to have a decrease in future interest income 
this managed gap does not include the impact of mortgage banking loan volume which provides a natural hedge against this gap position 
mortgage banking income tends to increase in times of lower or declining interest rates  as refinancing effectively leads to an increase in mortgage loan originations 
in a climate of higher or rising interest rates  mortgage loan originations  particularly refinancing  decrease and mortgage banking income therefore decreases 
allowance for loan losses the ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding was 
in  in and in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans at year end was  and at december   and  respectively 
the level of non performing loans at year end was   and  at december   and  or  and of total loans  respectively 
management made a provision for loan loss of  in   in and  in the significant increase in the provision for loan loss in over previous years was the result of the previously noted credit problems encountered within the company s asset based lending program 
such credit quality problems were exclusively related to this business unit  and the company exited this program 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors  including loan asset quality  related collateral and economic conditions prevailing during the loan s repayment 
in its loan policies  management has emphasized the borrower s ability to service the debt  the borrower s general creditworthiness and the quality of collateral 
while management believes that the allowance is sufficient for the existing loan portfolio  there can be no assurances that an additional allowance for losses on existing loans may not be necessary in the future  particularly if economic conditions within the company s market areas were to deteriorate 
potential problem loans at december   the company had  in non accrual loans  an increase of from december  non accrual loans consist of eleven individual credits and the total is less than one half of one percent of total loans 
the company had  in loans past due days or more that were still accruing at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing are well secured and in the process of collection 
in addition to loans on either non accrual status or loans past due days or more and still accruing  management had identified  of loans that have been internally classified 
these loans require more than normal attention and are potentially problem loans

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
statement no 
replaces fasb statement no 
 and revises the standards for accounting securitization and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain additional disclosures 
this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
those standards are based on consistent application of financial components approach that focuses on control 
under that approach  after a transfer of financial assets  an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered  and distinguishes transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings 
the disclosure requirement and collateral provisions of fasb statement no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december   while the other provisions of the new standard apply prospectively to transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after march  the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or the results of its operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management s methodology to measure interest rate sensitivity includes an analysis of the potential gain or loss in future fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the company s analysis assumes a hypothetical basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve in interest rates 
a present value computation is used in determining the effect of the hypothetical interest rate changes on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay 
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in this method of analysis 
if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of present value  actual values may differ from amounts disclosed 
however  if a hypothetical  parallel and instantaneous basis point increase and decrease were experienced  net fair values of interest sensitive instruments would be decreased by  and decreased by  respectively 
this fair value analysis  performed for the company by a third party vendor  tends to overstate interest rate risk within the company s balance sheet 
the analysis assigns the contractual long term maturity to mortgage loans within the funds advanced for settlement account 
such loans are generally held by the company for less than days  being pre sold to third party purchasers when the individual borrowers lock in their interest rates 
this extension of loan terms within this category of the company s balance sheet increases interest rate risk sensitivity calculated by the analysis 
the analysis also does not include a forecast of loan and deposit volume changes due to the hypothetical basis point interest rate change 
in addition  anticipated increased volume in the company s mortgage banking operation from a basis point decrease in rates is not included in the analysis 
this expected volume increase in mortgage lending as the result of a decline in interest rates would positively impact the company s earnings 
the standard algebraic formula for calculating present value is utilized 
the calculation discounts the future cash flows of the company s portfolio of interest rate sensitive instruments to present value utilizing techniques designed to approximate current market rates for securities  current offering rates for loans  and the cost of alternative funding for the given maturity of deposits  and then assumes a basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in these rates 
the difference between these numbers represents the resulting hypothetical change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
other significant assumptions used in the calculation include no growth in volume ie  replacement of maturities in like instruments  with no change in balance sheet mix  constant market interest rates reflecting the average rate from the last month of the given quarter  and pricing spreads to market rates derived from an historical analysis  or from assumptions by instrument type 
the company is not engaged in investment strategies involving derivative financial instruments 
asset and liability management is conducted without the use of forward based contracts  options  swap agreements  or other synthetic financial instruments
