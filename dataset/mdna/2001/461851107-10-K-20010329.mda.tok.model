wood 
in february  the company announced the formation of its woodvision division woodvision to develop the company s ct technology to optimize the value and yield of harvested timber

s dollars and when purchased in foreign currencies  are generally made on an as needed basis 
the company has some advance purchase commitments in foreign currencies with a few european suppliers 
the company currently does not hedge against these purchase commitments  as the foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material adverse impact on these purchases  however  the company will continue to monitor the foreign exchange rates and enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate foreign exchange risk as appropriate 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted sfas effective january  sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations at january  certain costs of providing warranty and maintenance services for systems sold to foreign countries are denominated in local currencies 
to the extent exchange rates fluctuate  it could become more expensive to provide these services 
to date  these costs have not been significant  however  the company expects they will increase as the company s installed base increases 
the impact of inflation has not been material on the company s operations or liquidity to date
