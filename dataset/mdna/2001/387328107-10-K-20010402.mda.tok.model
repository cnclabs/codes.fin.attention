item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general granite is one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and is engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
the company has offices in california  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona  florida  and utah 
the company s contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies  and private parties 
the company s bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts to the company may vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from construction contracts including construction joint ventures is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based upon costs incurred and projected costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs  equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs and insurance costs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contracts frequently extend over a period of more than one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates during construction are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided in total when determined  regardless of the degree of project completion 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized in the period when it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
the foregoing as well as weather  stage of completion  and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods 
the company s compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
thus  the company may experience an increase in general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and a decrease in less profitable years 
the company s profit sharing and pension contribution in excess of the k matching contributions is at the discretion of the board of directors based on the company reaching certain levels of profitability each year 
current year increase decrease in thousands revenue branch division    heavy construction division    revenue and backlog 
total revenue in increased to  million from  in which reflects a modest increase in revenue from the branch division partially offset by a decrease in hcd revenue 
the hcd revenue decrease resulted from a lack of new awards during the period from late through mid although hcd did receive significant new awards in late  they were booked too late in the year to make a significant contribution to year revenue 
on a market sector basis  revenue from private sector contracts increased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the company s private sector work is primarily comprised of site preparation for both commercial and residential developments and privately funded transportation projects 
although the private construction market remains strong in many of the areas that the company works  there have been some signs of slowing growth in the private sector see outlook 
the company s revenue from public sector contracts decreased slightly to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the level of funding for public sector projects remained strong through in most of the company s geographic markets 
the following is a breakdown of backlog as of december   and in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent by geographic area california    west excluding california    midwest  south and east    by market sector federal agencies    state agencies    local public agencies    private sector    the company s backlog at december  was  million  up million  or from the increase in backlog was due primarily to multiple hcd awards in the latter part of which include the las vegas monorail project in nevada  the company s portion of the hiawatha light rail joint venture in minnesota and a major bridge and interchange project in florida 
management believes that approximately of the work in the backlog at december  will be recognized as revenue during the company believes its bidding opportunities in its major marketplaces remain strong see outlook 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased in to from in the increased gross profit margin reflected increases in both branch division and hcd and was a result of the continued favorable market conditions in both the public and private sectors and the overall successful execution of projects 
year to date revenue recognized for projects less than complete was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as described under general above  the company recognizes revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until a project reaches complete 
during  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in the revenue from projects that were less than complete 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during the company has experienced upward pressure on costs associated with labor markets and oil prices  however  the company s gross profit margins were not materially impacted by such changes during general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december  and general and administrative expenses comprised the following in thousands in thousands salaries and related expenses   incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and pension   other general and administrative expenses   total   percent of revenue salaries and related expenses increased in over due primarily to increased staffing to support the company s current and expected growth 
incentive compensation and discretionary profit sharing and pension costs increased in over as a function of the company s increased profitability and the impact of certain members of company management reaching age  at which time all their restricted stock grants become fully vested 
other general and administrative expenses include various costs to support its operations  none of which exceeds of total general and administrative expenses 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses in primarily reflects the increases in facilities and other costs to support the company s growth 
operating income 
the heavy construction division s contribution to operating income in decreased slightly over the contribution due to a decreased volume of work performed as a result of hcd projects nearing completion 
these hcd projects have been replaced by several new awards in the latter half of  see revenue and backlog above 
however  these significant new projects were awarded too late in the year to have a significant impact on revenue and operating income in the branch division s contribution to operating income in increased compared to due primarily to increases in construction revenue and gross margins as described in the gross profit section above 
other income expenses 
other income increased million to million in the increase was primarily due to higher interest income resulting from the combined factor of higher interest rates and higher invested balances and the absence of the company s share of a loss of approximately million experienced by tic  in which the company currently has a equity investment  partially offset by lower gains on the sale of property and equipment 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in  an increase of from the increase reflects additional tax expense recognized in the first quarter related to the company reaching an agreement with tic to divest its investment over a three and one half year period 
outlook the company experienced a sizeable increase in new awards for the year ended december  this increase in new awards resulted in a improvement over the backlog at december  the company believes this is a quality backlog that will provide a firm foundation from which to grow its business going forward 
the bulk of these new awards were derived from the company s public sector marketplace 
as evidenced by the increase in new awards  the company expects its public sector business will remain very positive in the coming year 
the annual federal appropriations passed by congress under tea  and the matching state gas tax revenues continue to yield sizeable sums of money that flow into transportation programs across the country 
strong public sector markets nationwide should provide the company with the opportunity to be very selective in its bidding  looking for those projects where it may have competitive advantages in terms of resources or expertise 
however  it is still very early in the year to have a clear indication of how successful the company can be in growing its business in many of the larger projects the company was awarded in were awarded in the later half of the year 
as a result  some of the projects  most notably  the las vegas monorail project and the hiawatha light rail project  may or may not reach the percent complete profit recognition threshold in moreover  as always  it is difficult to predict this early in the year what our branch division s annual financial results will be 
unlike the heavy construction division  the branch division s work is not completely backlog driven as most of its contracts are short term in duration 
weather  competition  market demand and the short term nature of the business are just a few of the variables that significantly impact earnings visibility of the branch division in any given year 
there is also general uncertainty nationwide regarding the health of the economy 
while we remain cautiously optimistic about our private sector business  the economic slowdown may prompt a downturn in private sector development and consequently decreased opportunities for the company 
it is also unclear how the current power crisis in california will affect the company 
to mitigate the company s exposure  it is exploring alternative energy sources at its facilities 
while the current crisis is expected to continue into the summer during our peak production periods  we hope to be in a position to deliver when others cannot 
however  the threat of rolling blackouts during the peak summer construction season remains a risk to our business productivity 
during january  pg e corp  the parent company of pacific gas electric company failed to pay million in commercial paper that was held by the company at december  on march  the full million  plus interest  was paid 
looking at the prospects for the company s heavy construction division  it is experiencing a market that is extremely active 
texas is expected to again embark on a billion annual construction program 
florida has a similar program that was enhanced in with a funding package that adds billion of additional funds over the next years 
the design build market continues to grow rapidly  and hcd is currently targeting approximately billion of potential projects over the next months 
from an external growth perspective  the company has not been as successful in as it had anticipated in growing the business through mergers and acquisitions 
while the company has seen some excellent candidates  a strong construction market has inflated valuations to levels that make it difficult to achieve the type of return the company is looking for 
the company has several opportunities in the acquisition pipeline and will continue to be very assertive in the mergers and acquisitions area  but will remain disciplined in its approach 
in summary  the company s outlook for the short term  barring any contributions from acquisitions  is for a year of modest growth  given the uncertainties related to the timing of some of the larger projects  the california energy crisis and general economic conditions 
however  the company s long term prospects are anticipated to be exceptional  given the continued strength of the public sector marketplace 
prior years increase in thousands revenue branch division    heavy construction division    revenue and backlog 
the increased revenue in was primarily attributable to increased revenue from private sector contracts which increased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the company s private sector work is primarily comprised of site preparation for both commercial and residential developments and privately funded transportation projects

the company s revenue from public sector contracts increased to million in from million in while decreasing to of the company s total revenue in from in although the level of funding for public sector projects remained strong in in most of the company s markets  the increased tea funding did not significantly impact the company s revenue 
the increase in branch division revenue during the year resulted from increases in revenue from federal sector and from private sector contracts  partially offset by a decrease in local sector revenue 
the increase in hcd revenue was attributable to significantly drier weather conditions  particularly in texas and florida  and included revenue from a larger number of both private and public sector projects which included a private sector railroad project in texas which was awarded in mid  a private sector design build tollroad project in texas which was awarded in and a public sector design build highway project in arizona which was awarded in late the company s backlog at december  was million  down million  or from the decrease in backlog was due primarily to the absence of hcd awards in the fourth quarter 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased in to from in the increased gross profit margin was a result of the continued favorable market conditions in both the public and private sectors as described above  which tends to increase the company s ability to win competitively bid projects at higher margins 
additionally  gross profit margin in was positively impacted by drier weather conditions  which allowed for more efficient utilization of resources  and the successful execution of several hcd projects that were added to backlog in mid to late project to date revenue recognized for projects less than complete was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively

other general and administrative expenses include various costs to support its operations  none of which exceeds of total general and administrative expenses 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses in primarily reflect the absence of the collection of a previously written off bad debt that was recognized in and increases in other costs to support the company s growth 
operating income 
the heavy construction division s contribution to operating income in increased over the contribution due to increases in both the volume of work and the profit margins the division was able to achieve 
the division s profit margins were positively impacted by the successful execution of new work that was added to backlog in mid to late  including two design build projects  as well as drier weather conditions and improved margins on projects nearing completion 
the branch division s contribution to operating income in decreased slightly compared to due primarily to the absence of the collection of a previously written off bad debt and increases in other costs to support the company s growth 
other income expenses 
other income decreased million to million in the decrease was due primarily to a loss experienced by tic  in which the company had a equity investment 
the company s share of tic s loss was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from the company s share of tic income in this decrease was partially offset by a million gain recorded on the sale of a depleted quarry property
