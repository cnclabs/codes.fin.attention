net interest revenue is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s long term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest revenue  while balancing interest rate  credit  liquidity and capital risks 
for purposes of the following discussion  revenue from tax exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to fully taxable equivalent amounts  using an effective tax rate of

net interest margin is determined by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue by average earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average fully taxable equivalent yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is generally greater than the net interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  or free funding  such as demand deposits and shareholders equity 
net interest margin for was  a decline of basis points from for  which represented a decline of three basis points from for net interest rate spread for was  a decline of basis points from for  which represented an increase of two basis points from for the decline in net interest margin and net interest rate spread in was due to the significant increase in funding cost which was not offset by the smaller increase in asset yield 
the company experienced significant growth in average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities during the three years ended december  average interest earning assets increased during  during and during  due to increases in the company s loan and securities portfolios 
average interest bearing liabilities increased during  during and during  due to increases in the company s deposits and short term borrowings

conversely  in periods of increasing interest rates  based on this interest rate sensitivity gap  the company would likely experience decreased net interest income 
it should be noted that the balances shown in the table above are for a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
allocations to specific interest rate sensitivity periods are based on the earlier of maturity or repricing dates 
provisions for credit losses and allowance for credit losses the provision for credit losses is the annual cost of providing an allowance or reserve for estimated probable losses on loans 
the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
the process of determining the adequacy of the provision requires that management make material estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to significant change 
see item business 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in non performing and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and existing economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses for commercial loans is based principally upon the company s loan classification system 
the company has a disciplined approach for assigning credit ratings and classifications to individual credits 
each credit is assigned a grade by the relevant loan officer  which serves as a basis for the credit analysis of the entire portfolio 
the grade assigned considers the borrower s creditworthiness  collateral values  cash flows and other factors 
an independent loan review department is responsible for reviewing the credit rating and classification of individual credits and assessing trends in the portfolio  adherence to internal credit policies and procedures and other factors that may affect the overall adequacy of the allowance 
the loan review department is supplemented by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review 
the loss factors assigned to each classification are based upon the attributes loan to collateral values  borrower creditworthiness  etc 
of the loans typically assigned to each grade 
management periodically reviews the loss factors assigned in light of the general economic environment and overall condition of the loan portfolio and modifies the loss factors assigned to each classification as deemed appropriate 
the allowance for credit losses for the consumer loan portfolio is based upon delinquencies and historic loss rates 
the overall allowance includes a component representing the results of other analyses intended to insure that the allowance is adequate to cover other probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
this component considers analyses of changes in credit risk resulting from the differing underwriting criteria in acquired loan portfolios  industry concentrations  changes in the mix of loans originated  overall credit criteria and other economic indicators 
the provision for credit losses  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at the end of  and and net charge offs for those years are shown in the following table dollars in thousands provision for credit losses    allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at year end net charge offs    net charge offs as a percentage of average loans the provision for credit losses for increased from the provision for and reflects a one time charge of million made to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio acquired in the merger with first united bancshares  inc  and to reflect differences in underwriting standards at the acquired company 
in part  these differences in underwriting standards also led to a increase in net charge offs during and increases in internal credit ratings and classifications of the company s overall loan portfolio at december  the provision for credit losses for decreased from the provision for  principally as result of a decrease in net charge offs during in all years presented  increases in consumer based loans were the principal contributors to the higher levels of net charge offs 
other revenue the components of other revenue for the years ended december   and and the percentage change from the prior year are shown in the following table amount change amount change amount change dollars in thousands mortgage lending    service charges    life insurance premiums    trust income    securities gains losses  net  n m   insurance commissions    other    total other revenue    mortgage lending revenue consists principally of revenue generated by originating loans and by servicing loans for others 
the origination process  which includes secondary marketing of loans originated  produced revenue of   and  for  and  respectively 
historically  origination volumes have varied as mortgage interest rates have changed 
rising mortgage interest rates have generally resulted in a decrease in the volume of originations  while falling mortgage interest rates have generally resulted in an increased volume of originations 
the servicing process includes the actual servicing of loans and the recognition of changes in the valuation of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
capitalized mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based on the excess of the carrying amount of the mortgage servicing rights over their fair value 
the servicing process generated revenue of  in   in and  in the fluctuation in servicing revenue is primarily due to changes in the valuation of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
lower mortgage rates in resulted in impairment expense of million 
rising mortgage interest rates during resulted in the recovery of million during of previously recorded impairment 
this compares to the recognition of million in impairment expense during the following table presents the principal amount of mortgage loans serviced at december   and and the percentage change from the previous year end 
amount change amount change amount change dollars in millions mortgage loans serviced    service charges on deposit accounts increased in  and because of higher volumes of items processed as a result of greater economic activity  growth in the number of deposit accounts and rate increases 
life insurance premium revenue increased in and in  as compared to a decline during trust income increased in  in and in  as a result of increases in the number of trust accounts and the value of assets under care either managed or in custody 
in  the company restructured the securities portfolio acquired through the august  merger with first united bancshares  inc by selling approximately million of securities and reinvesting the net proceeds in higher yielding securities  which resulted in securities losses of million in in  the company established a charitable foundation and contributed appreciated equity securities to initially fund the foundation 
this transaction resulted in one time securities gains of approximately million  which are reflected in the results for revenue from insurance commissions grew steadily during  and  as the company continued to expand those products and services 
the increases in the other component of other revenue in and were primarily attributable to fees generated from brokerage and annuity sales  as well as increased analysis charges and debit card net interchange 
other expense the components of other expense for the years ended december   and and the percentage change from the prior year are shown in the following table 
amount change amount change amount change dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy  net    equipment    telecommunications    merger related    other    total other expense    salaries and employee benefits expense for  and included increases in salaries and employee benefits due to incentive payments and salary increases  increases in the cost of employee heath care benefits and the hiring of employees to staff the banking locations added during those years  however  salaries and employee benefits expense for all three years were impacted by changes in stock appreciation rights sars expense  which is included in salaries and employee benefits expense 
the company previously granted sars to certain of its employees  which requires the company to recognize an expense in the event of an increase in the market price of the company s common stock or a reduction of expense in the event of a decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
in  the company s common stock price declined by approximately  in the company s common stock price declined by approximately and in the company s common stock price declined by approximately 
as a result of these declines in value  reductions in expense of   and million were recorded in  and  respectively 
at december   the company had approximately  sars outstanding 
based on that amount  a dollar increase in the company s stock price would result in  in sar expense while a dollar decrease in the company s stock price would result in a  reduction in sar expense 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased in and principally as a result of additional branch offices and upgrades to the company s internal operating systems 
telecommunications expense increased significantly during and as a result of expanded voice and data networks and expansion of the bank s call center  all of which related to providing higher levels of convenient consumer oriented banking services 
the increase during in the other component of other expense was primarily attributable to a contribution of appreciated equity securities with an aggregate market value of million to a charitable foundation established by the company in as a direct result of the company s merger activity  merger related and other costs of million  million and million were recorded in  and  respectively 
these merger related and other costs included termination and change of control payments  contract termination charges  professional fees  elimination of duplicate facilities charges and other charges 
at december   approximately million in accrued charges related to merger activity were unpaid 
these consisted primarily of termination and change of control payments related to mergers in and the cost of abandonment of a duplicate headquarters facility acquired in the merger with merchants capital corporation 
the company has formulated  documented and approved plans with respect to termination and change of control payments and expects to make these payments during the duplicate headquarters facility has been abandoned and is listed for sale

amount change amount change amount change dollars in millions loans  net of unearned average    loans  net of unearned year end    despite significant increases in the company s loan portfolio  quality is stressed in the company s lending policy as opposed to growth 
the company s nonperforming assets  which are carried either in the loan account or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets  were as follows at the end of each year presented 
dollars in thousands foreclosed properties    non accrual loans    loans days or more past due    restructured loans   total non performing assets    total non performing assets as a percentage of net loans the increase in the company s non performing assets in reflects a general slow down in the overall economy of the region serviced by the company 
the company has not  as a matter of policy  participated in any highly leveraged transactions nor made any loans or investments relating to corporate transactions such as leveraged buyouts or leveraged recapitalizations 
at december   and  the company did not have any concentration of loans in excess of of loans outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
however  the company does conduct business in a geographically concentrated area 
the ability of the company s borrowers to repay loans may be dependent upon the economic conditions prevailing in the market area 
included in non performing assets above were loans the company considered impaired totaling   and  at december   and  respectively 
securities and other earning assets the securities portfolio is used to make various term investments  to provide a source of liquidity and to serve as collateral to secure certain types of deposits and borrowings 
a portion of the company s securities portfolio continues to be tax exempt 
investments in tax exempt securities totaled million at december   compared to million at the end of the company invests only in investment grade securities  with the exception of obligations of certain counties and municipalities within the company s market area  and avoids other high yield nonrated securities and investments 
see item business investment portfolio 
at december   the company s available for sale securities totaled million 
these securities  which are subject to possible sale  are recorded at fair value 
at december   the company held no securities whose decline in fair value was considered other than temporary 
net unrealized gains on investment securities as of december  totaled million 
net unrealized gains on held to maturity securities comprised million of that total  while net unrealized gains on available for sale securities were million 
net unrealized losses on investment securities as of december  totaled million 
of that total  million was attributable to held to maturity securities and million to available for sale securities 
in the fourth quarter of  the company restructured the securities portfolio acquired in the august  merger with first united bancshares  inc by selling approximately million of securities and reinvesting the net proceeds in higher yielding securities 
deposits deposits are the company s primary source of funds to support its earning assets 
the company has been able to effectively compete for deposits in its primary market areas 
see item business deposits 
the following table presents the company s average deposit mix and percentage change for the years indicated 
average average average balance change balance change balance change dollars in millions interest bearing deposits    non interest bearing deposits total average deposits    liquidity the company s goal is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand or any potential increase in the normal level of deposit withdrawals 
this goal is accomplished primarily by maintaining sufficient short term liquid assets coupled with consistent growth in core deposits in order to fund earning assets and to maintain the availability of unused capacity to acquire funds in national and local capital markets 
management believes that the company s traditional sources of maturing loans  investment securities  mortgages held for sale  purchased federal funds and base of core deposits are adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs for normal operations 
the company maintains a relationship with the federal home loan bank  which provides an additional source of liquidity to fund term loans with borrowings of matched or longer maturities 
the matching of these assets and liabilities has had the effect of reducing the company s net interest margin 
see deposits and item business short term borrowings 
capital resources the company is required to comply with the riskbased capital guidelines established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
these guidelines apply a variety of weighting factors which vary according to the level of risk associated with the assets 
capital is measured in two tiers tier i consists of paidup share capital  including common stock and disclosed reserves retained earnings and related surplus in the case of common stock  and tier ii consists of general allowance for losses on loans and leases  hybrid debt capital instruments  and all or a portion of other subordinated capital debt  depending upon remaining term to maturity 
total capital is the sum of tier i and tier ii capital 
the company s tier i capital and total capital  as a percentage of total riskadjusted assets  was and  respectively  at december   compared to and  respectively at december  both ratios exceeded the required minimum levels for these ratios of and  respectively  for each period 
in addition  the company s tier leverage capital ratio tier i capital divided by total assets  less goodwill was at december  and at december   compared to the required minimum leverage capital ratio of 
the fdic s capitalbased supervisory system for insured financial institutions categorizes the capital position for banks into five categories  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
for a bank to classify as well capitalized  the tier i riskbased capital  total risk based capital and leverage capital ratios must be at least  and  respectively 
the bank met the criteria for the well capitalized category at december  the company may pursue acquisition transactions of depository institutions and businesses closely related to banking which further the company s business strategies 
the company anticipates that the consideration for substantially all of these transactions  if any  would be shares of the company s common stock  however  transactions involving cash consideration or other forms of consideration may also be considered

we undertake no obligation to update the forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report 
our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation 
bancorpsouth  inc is a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act of  and bancorpsouth bank is a mississippi state banking corporation 
accordingly  both are subject to extensive governmental regulation  legislation and control 
these laws limit the manner in which we operate  including the amount of loans we can originate  interest we can charge on loans and fees we can charge for certain services 
we cannot predict whether  or the extent to which  the government and governmental organizations may change any of these laws or controls 
we also cannot predict how any of these changes would adversely affect our business and prospects 
we compete with other bank holding companies  banks and financial services companies 
the banking business is extremely competitive in our service areas in mississippi  tennessee  alabama  arkansas  texas and louisiana 
we compete  and will compete  with well established banks  credit unions and other financial institutions  several of which have significantly greater resources and lending limits than do we 
some of these competitors provide certain services that we do not provide 
rising interest rates may result in higher interest rates being paid on interest bearing deposits than are charged on outstanding loans 
if interest rates rise  we may pay interest on our customers interest bearing deposits and our other liabilities at rates higher than the interest rates paid to us by our customers on outstanding loans that were made when interest rates were at a lower level 
this situation would result in a negative interest rate spread with respect to those loans and cause an adverse effect on our earnings 
this adverse effect would increase if interest rates continued to rise while we had outstanding loans payable at fixed rates that could not be adjusted to a higher interest rate 
our growth strategy includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
a material element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional banks and bank holding companies in order to achieve greater economies of scale 
we cannot assure you that the current level of growth opportunities will continue to exist  that we will be able to acquire banks and bank holding companies that satisfy our criteria or that any such acquisition will be on terms favorable to us 
further  our growth strategy will require that we continue to hire qualified personnel  while concurrently expanding our managerial and operational infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to hire and retain qualified personnel or that we will be able to successfully expand our infrastructure to accommodate future growth 
as a result of these factors  we may not realize the expected economic benefits associated with our acquisitions 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
our stock price may fluctuate 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
any announcement with respect to the banking industry  market conditions or any variance in our revenues or earnings from levels generally expected by securities analysts for a given period could have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of our common stock 
issuing additional shares of our common stock to acquire other banks and bank holding companies may result in dilution for existing shareholders 
in connection with our growth strategy  we have issued  and may issue in the future  shares of our common stock to acquire additional banks and bank holding companies 
resales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market and the potential of such sales could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
we usually must pay an acquisition premium above the fair market value of acquired assets for the acquisition of banks and bank holding companies 
paying this acquisition premium  in addition to the dilutive effect of issuing additional shares  may also adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
monetary policies and economic factors may limit our ability to attract deposits or make loans 
the monetary policies of federal regulatory authorities  particularly the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and economic conditions in our service area and the united states generally  affect our ability to attract deposits and extend loans 
we cannot predict either the nature or timing of any changes in these monetary policies and economic conditions  or their impact on our financial performance 
the banking business is subject to various material business risks  which may become more acute in periods of economic slowdown or recession 
during such periods  foreclosures generally increase  and such conditions also could lead to a potential decline in deposits and demand for loans 
this could adversely affect our financial performance 
diversification in types of financial services may adversely affect our financial performance 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past diversified  and may further diversify  our lines of business into areas that are not traditionally associated with the banking business 
we now offer insurance and investment services through wholly owned subsidiaries of bancorpsouth bank 
as a result  we must now manage the investment of additional capital and the significant involvement of our senior management to develop and integrate the insurance and investment services subsidiaries with our traditional banking operations 
we offer no assurances that we will be able to develop and integrate these new services without adversely effecting our financial performance 
our ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by law 
we derive our income primarily from dividends received from owning bancorpsouth bank s common stock 
federal and state law limits the bank s ability to declare and pay dividends 
in addition  the board of governors of the federal reserve system may impose restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock 
our subsidiaries may be sued for large punitive damages in connection with increased litigation against financial services companies in our market areas 
in some states in which we operate  there has been a trend toward increased class action lawsuits and other litigation against financial services companies in connection with lending and other financial transactions 
these actions tend to seek punitive damages for transactions that involve relatively small amounts of actual damages 
some of these actions have resulted in large settlements or awards of punitive damages 
some of our subsidiaries are defendants in similar lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are seeking substantial punitive damages 
legislation and court decisions in some states may limit the amount of punitive damages that can be recovered in legal proceedings  however  we cannot predict the effect of such legislation and court precedent at this time 
anti takeover provisions may prevent a change of our control 
our governing documents and certain agreements to which we are a party contain several provisions which make a change in control difficult to accomplish  and may discourage a potential acquirer 
these include a shareholder rights plan or poison pill  a classified or staggered board  change in control agreements with members of management and supermajority voting requirements 
these anti takeover provisions may have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock 
limited geographic area increases our risk from economic downturn 
we conduct business in the limited geographic area of mississippi  tennessee  alabama  arkansas  texas and louisiana 
an economic downturn in the economies of these states or the southern region of the united states could adversely affect our financial performance  particularly our ability to attract deposits and extend loans 
in evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock  the factors set forth in this section should be carefully considered  along with other matters discussed in reports and other filings that we have made with the securities and exchange commission 
it should not be assumed that we have listed or described the only risks that could affect our future performance or the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices 
this risk of loss can be reflected in either reduced potential net interest revenue in future periods or diminished market values of financial assets 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk that is inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid 
the rates of interest the company earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  the company is exposed to lower profit margins or losses if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
several techniques might be used by a financial institution to minimize interest rate risk 
one approach used by the company is to periodically analyze its assets and liabilities and make future financing and investing decisions based on payment streams  interest rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities and estimated sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
such activities fall under the broad definition of asset liability management 
the company s primary asset liability management technique is the measurement of its asset liability gap  that is  the difference between the amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced repriced during a given period 
if the asset amount to be repriced exceeds the corresponding liability amount for a certain day  month  year or longer period  the company is in an asset sensitive gap position 
in this situation  net interest revenue would increase if market interest rates rose or decrease if market interest rates fell 
if alternatively  more liabilities than assets will reprice  the company is in a liability sensitive position 
accordingly  net interest revenue would decline when rates rose and increase when rates fell 
these examples assume that interest rate changes for assets and liabilities are of the same magnitude  whereas actual interest rate changes generally differ in magnitude for assets and liabilities 
management seeks to manage interest rate risk through the utilization of various tools that include matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities and managing the composition and size of the investment portfolio so as to reduce the risk in the deposit and loan portfolios  while at the same time maximizing the yield generated from the portfolio 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the expected maturity categories take into account repricing opportunities as well as contractual maturities 
for core deposits without contractual maturities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents cash flows based on management s judgement concerning their most likely runoff or repricing behaviors 
the fair value of loans  deposits and other borrowings are based on the discounted value of expected cash flows using a discount rate which is commensurate with the maturity
