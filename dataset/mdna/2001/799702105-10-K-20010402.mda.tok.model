e profile is a vertical services provider vsp for the financial services industry that provides integrated end to end operations and technology solutions that enable top tier financial services companies to offer on line financial services to their customers

as of january   e profile was processing in excess of  accounts at its bank operations and data center for six clients 
the company derives its revenues from product fees  service fees and software maintenance fees 
product fees include software license and product enhancement fees 
service fees include client implementation related services  processing and consulting fees 
for sanchez software license contracts  product fees are paid in stages upon the completion  by the company  of certain defined dates and deliverables 
the company recognizes revenue from these fees using the percentage of completion contract accounting method  or where applicable  on a cash basis 
service fees are generally recognized and billed monthly on a time and material basis 
maintenance fees are normally billed annually in advance and recognized into revenue ratably over the period covered 
the company s e commerce projects generate implementation related service revenues for both sanchez and e profile  which are largely deferred during the implementation phase along with the related costs until the client begins processing its accounts on e profile s outsourced platform 
once a client goes live  the deferred revenue and costs are amortized over the expected life of the processing arrangement 
in lieu of up front  one time license fees  e profile contracts generate on going processing fees  which include license and maintenance charges for sanchez software on a per account per month basis over the life of the processing contract after the client goes live with the solution 
in addition  these projects generate on going processing fee related services revenue for e profile 
under this model  as a client institution s e commerce account base grows  sanchez increases its revenue stream

the company currently anticipates that cash generated from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy its operating and capital cash needs for the foreseeable future and at a minimum through the next year 
should the company s business expand more rapidly than expected  the company believes that additional capital  if necessary  would be available to fund such operating and capital requirements 
the company believes that its business is generally not seasonal  however  the company has historically experienced  and can be expected to continue to experience  a certain degree of variability in its quarterly revenue  earnings and cash flow patterns 
this variability is typically driven by significant events  which directly impact the recognition and billing of project related revenues 
examples of such events include the timing of new business contract closings and the initiation of product and service fee revenue recognition  one time payments from existing clients relative to license expansion rights required to process a greater number of customer accounts or expand the number of permitted users and completion of implementation project roll outs and the related revenue recognition 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client projects  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company believes that over the course of time the ongoing monthly revenue stream associated with the e profile outsourcing alternative will contribute toward more predictable quarter to quarter revenues
