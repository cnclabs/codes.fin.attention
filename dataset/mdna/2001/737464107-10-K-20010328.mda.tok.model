new accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements of the company

ffo is defined to mean net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
cash available for distribution cad is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations and loan amortization payments 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo and cad should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report

the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition

factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following the economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by a reduction in jobs  industry slowdowns and other factors  local conditions  such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  apartment homes  a future economic downturn that simultaneously affects one or more of the company s geographic markets  declines in household formation  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent the company from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and competition from other available apartments and changes in market rental rates 
any of these factors could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve desired operating results from its communities 
development and construction risks could impact the company s profitability 
the company intends to continue to develop and construct apartment communities 
development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties 
the company s development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks the company may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  the company may incur construction costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  and the company may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs  the company intends to concentrate its attention on fewer markets and reduce annual development expenditures  and it may abandon development opportunities that it has already begun to explore  and it may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring those opportunities  the company has been and may continue to be unable to complete construction and lease up of a community on schedule and meet financial goals for development projects  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  the company may be unable to meet its profitability goals for that community  and construction costs have been increasing in the company s existing markets  and may continue to increase in the future and  in some cases  the costs of upgrading acquired communities have  and may continue to  exceed original estimates and the company may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for these increases in costs 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company s growth 
the company may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
the company s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit the company s operational and financial flexibility 
although the company has experienced success in disposing of apartment communities that no longer meet its strategic objectives  market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay acceptable prices 
a weak market may limit the company s ability to change its portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions 
also  if the company is unable to sell apartment communities or if it can only sell apartment communities at prices lower than are generally acceptable  then the company may not have adequate capital to execute its development and construction strategy 
furthermore  a significant portion of the proceeds from the company s overall property sales may be held in escrow accounts in order for some sales to qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  the company may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from property sales 
changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of the company s securities 
the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates 
therefore  if interest rates increase  the company s interest costs will rise to the extent its variable rate debt is not hedged effectively 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of the company s securities to demand a higher annual yield  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common and preferred stock and debt securities 
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could affect the company s debt financing and create refinancing risk 
the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 
although the company may be able to use cash flow to make future principal payments  it cannot assure investors that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy the distribution requirements that the company must satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following factors  among others  may affect the cash flows generated by the company s apartment communities the national and local economies  local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply of apartment homes  the perceptions by prospective residents of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the company s communities and the neighborhoods in which they are located  the company s ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and rental expenses  including real estate taxes and utilities 
expenses associated with the company s investment in a community  such as debt service  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in cash flows from operations from that community 
if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to make the mortgage payments  the company could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgagee 
the company is likely to need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that the company may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
as of december   the company had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of approximately million and senior unsecured debt of approximately million and outstanding indebtedness under its lines of credit aggregating million 
the company could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increased risk of default and in an increase in its debt service requirements 
the company s board of directors has adopted a policy of limiting indebtedness to approximately of the undepreciated book value of its assets  but the company s organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount or percentage of indebtedness  funded or otherwise  that it might incur 
if this policy were changed  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect funds from operations and the company s ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders and the operating partnership s ability to make expected distributions to its limited partners and in an increased risk of default on the obligations of the company and the operating partnership 
in addition  the company s and the operating partnership s ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in bank and other credit agreements 
the company manages its debt to be in compliance with its stated policy and with these debt covenants  but subject to compliance with these covenants  the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company s ability to service the additional debt 
accordingly  the company could become more leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on its obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  both of which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 
debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to the company s shareholders 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts  or on favorable terms or at all 
if the company issues additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt  the interests of existing shareholders could be diluted 
acquired communities may not achieve anticipated results 
the company intends to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet its investment criteria 
the company s acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired community may fail to achieve expected occupancy and rental rates and may fail to perform as expected  the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations  and the company s estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate  causing the company to fail to meet its profitability goals 
increased competition could limit the company s ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
the company s apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect the company s ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
limited investment opportunities could adversely affect the company s growth 
the company expects that other real estate investors will compete to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties 
these competitors include insurance companies  pension and investment funds  developer partnerships  investment companies and other apartment reits 
this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that the company would likely pursue  and competitors may have greater resources than the company 
as a result  the company may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms  which could adversely affect its growth 
interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges 
from time to time when the company anticipates issuing debt securities  it may seek to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
the company may do this to increase the predictability of its financing costs 
also  from time to time the company may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit its exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates 
if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of  or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than the company incurs under  a particular interest rate hedging contract  the contract is ineffective 
furthermore  the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 
these charges are typically related to the extent and timing of fluctuations in interest rates 
despite the company s efforts to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company cannot guarantee that it will maintain coverage for all of its outstanding indebtedness at any particular time 
if the company does not effectively protect itself from this risk  it may be subject to increased interest costs resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
losses from natural catastrophes may exceed insurance coverage 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on its properties  which are believed to be of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets 
the company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties acquired in the future 
however  some losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as losses from floods or earthquakes  may be subject to limitations 
the company exercises discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on its investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms 
if the company suffers a substantial loss  its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of the lost investment 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
the company is in the business of acquiring  developing  owning  operating and from time to time selling real estate 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  as a current or former owner or operator  the company could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances  often regardless of its knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of its current or former ownership or operation of the real estate 
in addition  the company could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
these costs could be substantial  and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment 
the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to the company s properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 
the americans with disabilities act  the fair housing act of and other federal  state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants 
these laws may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require the company to add other structural features that increase construction costs 
legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons 
the company cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws  which may be substantial 
the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes depends upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed upon reits under the internal revenue code 
the company believes that it has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december   and plans to continue to meet the requirements to qualify as a reit in the future 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
the company cannot guarantee  therefore  that it has qualified or will continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that the company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within the company s control 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new decisions that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the company to remain qualified as a reit 
the company does not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize its reit status 
if the company were to fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code did not apply  the company would be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  leaving less money available for distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  distributions to shareholders in any year in which the company failed to qualify would not be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes nor would they be required to be made 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  the company also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a reit 
it is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances the company would be entitled to such statutory relief 
the company s failure to qualify as a reit likely would have a significant adverse effect on the value of its securities 
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
management believes that the operating partnership qualifies  and has so qualified since its formation  as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates 
in addition  the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit 
see the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes above 
the company s shareholders may not be able to effect a change of control 
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the company  the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  and the georgia business corporation code contain a number of provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for the company s shareholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following ownership limit 
one of the requirements for maintenance of the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals  including entities specified in the internal revenue code  during the last half of any taxable year 
primarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the ownership limit under the company s articles of incorporation prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock  subject to an exception for shares of common stock held by mr 
williams and mr 
glover  the company s chairman and vice chairman 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
further  the company s articles of incorporation include provisions allowing it to stop transfers of and redeem its shares that are intended to assist the company in complying with these requirements 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing someone from taking control  even though a change of control might involve a premium price for the company s shareholders or might otherwise be in the shareholders best interests 
staggered board 
the company s articles of incorporation provides that the board of directors will consist of eight members and can be increased or decreased after that according to its bylaws  provided that the total number of directors is not less than three nor more than pursuant to the company s bylaws  the number of directors will be fixed by the board of directors within the limits in its articles of incorporation 
the board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors for each class are chosen for a three year term 
the staggered terms for directors may affect the company s shareholders ability to effect a change of control  even if a change of control would be in the interest of the shareholders 
preferred shares  classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without shareholder approval 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that the total number of shares of stock of all classes which it has authority to issue is  consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  of which  had been issued as of december  the board of directors has the authority  without a vote of shareholders  to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock  including common stock into preferred stock or vice versa  and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other class or series of shares to be issued 
the issuance of preferred stock or other shares having special preferences or rights could delay or prevent a change of control even if a change of control would be in the interests of the shareholders 
because the board of directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of shares without a shareholder vote  the board of directors may give the holders of any class or series preferences  powers and rights  including voting rights  senior to the rights of holders of the company s common stock 
consent rights of the unitholders 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the company may not merge or consolidate with another entity unless the merger includes the merger of the operating partnership  which requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of limited partnership 
if the company were to ever hold less than a majority of the units  this voting requirement might limit the possibility for an acquisition or a change of control 
georgia anti takeover statutes 
the georgia business corporation code generally restricts a company from entering into certain business combinations with an interested shareholder for a period of five years after the date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder unless the transaction is approved by the board of directors of the company prior to the date the person becomes an interested shareholder  the interested shareholder acquires of the company s voting stock in the same transaction in which it exceeds or subsequent to becoming an interested shareholder  the shareholder acquires of the company s voting stock and the business combination is approved by the holders of a majority of the voting stock entitled to vote on the business combination 
an interested shareholder is defined as any person or entity that is the beneficial owner of at least of the company s voting stock 
this business combination statute will not apply unless the bylaws of the corporation specifically provides that the statute is applicable to the corporation 
the company has not elected to be covered by this statute  but it could so by action of the board of directors at any time 
georgia fair price statute 
the georgia fair price statute imposes fair price and procedural requirements applicable to business combinations with any person who owns or more of the common stock 
these statutory requirements restrict business combinations with  and accumulations of shares of voting stock of  certain georgia corporations 
this fair price statute will not apply unless the bylaws of the corporation specifically provides that the statute is applicable to the corporation 
the company has not elected to be covered by this statute  but it could do so by action of the board of directors at any time

in addition  the company had  in variable tax exempt debt tied to aaa non amt 
in addition  the company has interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
the discussion in this interest rate sensitivity section is the same for the company and the operating partnership  except that all indebtedness described herein has been incurred by the operating partnership 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows maintain a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  fix certain long term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps with appropriately matching maturities  use treasury locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions  and take advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity 
management uses various financial models and advisors to achieve these objectives
