acquisitions we have actively pursued mergers and other business acquisitions to expand our global reach  manufacturing capacity and service offerings and to diversify and strengthen customer relationships 
the significant business combinations completed in fiscal  include the following date acquired company nature of business consideration november jit holdings ltd 
provides electronics  ordinary shares manufacturing and design services august chatham technologies  inc provides industrial and  ordinary shares electronics manufacturing and design services august lightning metal provides injection molding   ordinary shares specialties metal and related entities stamping and integration services april palo alto products provides industrial and  ordinary shares international pte 
ltd 
electronics manufacturing and design services april the dii group  inc provides electronics  ordinary shares manufacturing services each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests and our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the combined operations of the merged companies for all periods presented 
additionally  we have completed other immaterial pooling of interests transactions in fiscal prior period statements have not been restated for these transactions 
we have also made a number of business acquisitions of other companies 
these transactions were accounted for using the purchase method and  accordingly our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition 
pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or an aggregate basis 
other strategic transactions on may   we entered into a strategic alliance for product manufacturing with motorola 
in connection with this strategic alliance  motorola paid million for an equity instrument that provided it with incentives to purchase products and services from us by entitling it to acquire  of our ordinary shares at any time by meeting targeted purchase levels of up to billion through december  or by making additional payments to us 
the issuance of this equity instrument on may  resulted in a one time non cash charge equal to the excess of the fair value of the equity instrument issued over the million proceeds received 
as a result  the one time non cash charge amounted to approximately million offset by a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital in the first quarter of fiscal in june  we entered into an agreement with motorola under which we repurchased this equity instrument for million 
no current or planned manufacturing programs are affected by the repurchase  and we anticipate that motorola will continue to be a customer following the repurchase  although our future revenue from motorola may be less than it would have been had this instrument remained in effect 
in april  we entered into a definitive agreement with ericsson with respect to our management of the operations of ericsson s mobile telephone operations 
operations under this arrangement commenced in the first quarter of fiscal under this agreement  we are to provide a substantial portion of ericsson s mobile phone requirements 
we will assume responsibility for product assembly  new product prototyping  supply chain management and logistics management  in which we will process customer orders from ericsson and configure and ship products to ericsson s customers 
we expect to provide pcbs and plastics  primarily from our asian operations 
in connection with this relationship  we purchased certain equipment  inventory and other assets  and assumed certain accrued expenses  from ericsson at their net book value of approximately million 
see item  business risk factors our strategic relationship with ericsson creates risks 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal year ended march  net sales cost of sales unusual charges gross margin selling  general and administrative goodwill and intangibles amortization unusual charges interest and other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss net sales we derive our net sales from a wide range of service offerings  including product design  semiconductor design  printed circuit board assembly and fabrication  enclosures  material procurement  inventory and supply chain management  final system assembly and test  packaging  logistics and distribution 
net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion in fiscal the increase in sales for fiscal was primarily the result of our ability to continue to expand sales to our existing customers as well as expanding sales to new customers worldwide and  to a lesser extent  the incremental revenue associated with the purchases of several manufacturing facilities and related assets during fiscal during fiscal  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales  with no customer accounting for more than of net sales 
while we experienced significant growth in net sales in fiscal  this growth was hampered in late fiscal by a decline in demand due to the downturn experienced by the electronics industry  which was driven by a combination of weakening end market demand particularly in the telecommunications and networking sectors and our customers inventory imbalances 
along with other providers of electronics manufacturing services  our fourth quarter net sales were adversely affected by reductions in purchase volumes and delays in purchases by certain customers  as they continued to experience erosion in demand for their products 
this trend has continued through the first quarter of fiscal and may continue  or worsen  in future periods  as the timing of any recovery in our customers markets is uncertain 
net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion in fiscal the increase in sales for fiscal was primarily due to expanding sales to existing customers and  to a lesser extent  sales to new customers 
in fiscal  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales  with ericsson accounting for approximately of net sales 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales 
gross profit gross profit varies from period to period and is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  component costs  product life cycles  unit volumes  startup  expansion and consolidation of manufacturing facilities  pricing  competition and new product introductions 
see item  business risk factors 
gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to unusual pre tax charges amounting to million  which were associated with the plant closures  as described in unusual charges  below 
excluding unusual pre tax charges of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal excluding unusual pre tax charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal our gross profit in each fiscal year was adversely affected by several factors  including costs associated with expanding our facilities  costs associated with the startup of new customers and projects  which typically carry higher levels of under absorbed manufacturing overhead costs until the projects reach higher volume production  and changes in our product mix to higher volume projects  which typically have a lower gross margin because of higher material content 
increased mix of products that have relatively high material costs as a percentage of total unit costs can adversely affect our gross margins 
further  we may enter into supply arrangements in connection with strategic relationships and oem divestitures 
these arrangements  which are relatively larger in scale  could adversely affect our gross margins 
we believe that these and other factors may adversely affect our gross margins  but we do not expect that this will have a material effect on our income from operations 
unusual charges fiscal we recognized unusual pre tax charges of approximately million during fiscal year of this amount  million was recorded in the first quarter and was comprised of approximately million related to the issuance of an equity instrument to motorola combined with approximately million of expenses resulting from the dii and palo alto products international mergers and related facility closures 
in the second quarter  unusual pre tax charges amounted to approximately million associated with the chatham and lightning mergers and related facility closures 
in the third quarter  we recognized unusual pre tax charges of approximately million  primarily related to the jit merger and related facility closures 
during the fourth quarter  we recognized unusual pre tax charges  amounting to million related to the closures of several manufacturing facilities 
on may   we entered into a strategic alliance for product manufacturing with motorola
