the forward looking statements are based on our expectations as of the date of this report and we take no obligation to update these statements 
the forward looking statements herein do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions or other business combinations that have been completed after december   including our combination with ticketmaster group  inc 
and its subsidiaries the combination 
the discussion below relates only to our operations prior to the combination  which occurred after december  overview ticketmaster formerly known as ticketmaster online citysearch  inc prior to the combination was  and continues to be  a leading local portal and electronic commerce company that provides in depth local content and services to help people get things done online 
we offer practical tools for living that make the internet an important part of people s everyday lives

com  among others 
we derive revenues from three sources online ticketing  city guide and related services which includes online personals subscriptions and sales of sponsorships and advertising 
prior to the combination  and for purposes of our financial statements for the year ended december   we viewed our operations as being in one segment  with ongoing integration 
ticketing operations revenues primarily consist of convenience and handling charges generated through ticket sales 
the sale of tickets for an event often commences several months prior to the scheduled date of the event 
ticketing operations revenue is recognized when the ticket is sold 
the number of tickets sold can vary as a result of i additions or deletions to the list of client facilities serviced by tm corp  ii fluctuation in the scheduling of events  particularly for popular performers  iii overall consumer demand for live entertainment events  and iv the percentage of tickets which are sold directly by clients or through other distribution systems offered by tm corp and not through our web site 
the average convenience charge per ticket typically varies based upon numerous factors including the type of event as well as the services to be rendered to the client 
if credit card chargeback or refund activity is likely to occur with respect to an event  for example  due to the cancellation of such event  an allowance is established for potential convenience charge refunds 
city guide and related revenues consist of revenues derived primarily from web based city guides in the forms of revenue from custom built web sites and other consulting services and online personals subscriptions 
in our owned and operated city guide markets  we derive our revenues primarily from the sale to local businesses of web sites which we create  host and maintain  as well as place in our directory listings so that the businesses receive exposure to our users 
business web site customers typically enter into one year agreements that automatically convert to month to month contracts upon expiration 
we recognize revenue from sales of local business web sites on a monthly basis over the term of each contract as services are rendered 
in partner led markets  we derive licensing and royalty revenues from the licensing of our technology and business systems  from consulting services and from providing back office and hosting services 
we do not expect to enter into additional domestic partnerships to launch city guides going forward 
licensing revenue under license agreements is recognized over the term of the license agreement or the period over which the relevant services are delivered for use of our business and technology systems 
royalty revenue is recognized as earned and is typically a percentage of partner led market revenues from web site sales  banners  advertisements  sponsorships and other ancillary offerings 
in our integrated personals operations  we derive subscription fee revenue from customers who subscribe for our online matchmaking and dating services for one to twelve months 
subscription fee revenues are recognized monthly over the contract term 
sponsorship and advertising revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and are primarily recognized over the term of the promotion either ratably or based on our fulfillment of advertising campaign milestones 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
operating costs ticketing operations costs consist primarily of expenses associated with ticket fulfillment including the license fee to tm corp  web site maintenance  service and network infrastructure maintenance and data communications 
city guide and related costs consist primarily of the expenses associated with the design  layout  photography  customer service and editorial resources used in production and maintenance of business web sites  editorial content and network infrastructure maintenance in connection with the city guide operations  and costs of affiliate referral commissions  customer service and network infrastructure maintenance associated with the online personals operations 
recent developments on january   our company was combined with ticketmaster group and its subsidiaries in a transaction structured as an acquisition by us of such entities 
in the first step  tm corp contributed to us all of the equity interests of its subsidiaries except for shares of our common stock that it holds  along with its assets that were freely assignable 
the shares of our common stock that were then held by tm corp were not contributed or canceled and continue to be held by tm corp 
in exchange for the contributions by tm corp  we issued to tm corp  shares of our class b common stock 
in the second step  usa networks contributed to us all of the outstanding capital stock of ticketmaster group 
in exchange for the capital stock of ticketmaster group  we issued to usa networks  new shares of our class b common stock at the time of the closing of the combination

upon completion of the combination  ticketmaster group and the former subsidiaries of tm corp whose equity interests were contributed to us became our direct subsidiaries and tm corp became our indirect subsidiary 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a combination between entities under common control in a manner similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting 
as a result of the combination  prior year financials will be restated in future filings to present the company as if it had been combined with ticketmaster group which will be similar to the pro forma presentation reported in schedule c filed with the sec in january on february   we completed an acquisition of reserveamerica holdings  inc reserveamerica  the leading provider of campsite reservations 
we paid million in cash for the initial consideration due in the transaction 
the purchase price will be increased for additional shares of our common stock to be granted upon achievement of revenue targets based on our stock price at that time

our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate  primarily as a result of foreign income taxes and operating losses not benefited 
we expect that our domestic tax provision will remain low throughout due to the availability of consolidated net operating losses following the combination 
the company s balance sheet has a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss which is fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the company will retain the valuation allowance until it is likely that the company will be able to utilize the net operating loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
seasonality ticketmaster s ticket sales are occasionally impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public  which vary depending upon scheduling by the client 
the second quarter of the year generally experiences the most events
