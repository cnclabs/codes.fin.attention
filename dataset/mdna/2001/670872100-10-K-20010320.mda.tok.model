table of contents results of operations compared to net sales for were million  an increase of compared to the increase in sales resulted principally through an increase in physical volume of products sold  primarily due to the acquisition of okn 
the following table summarizes market price fluctuations on the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products market price ranges per pound year ended december  cobalt grade to to nickel to to copper to to the company sold million pounds of product during  an increase of compared to million pounds in the increase in physical volume of organic products sold was primarily due to generally stronger cobalt catalyst sales in all geographic regions and increased sales of plastic additives in asia pacific 
in the inorganics category  the increase in physical volume of products sold reflects increased volume of electronics chemicals  strong demand for nickel catalyst products in the united states and higher sales of battery grade chemicals in asia pacific 
the increase in physical volume of powder products reflects increases in sales of cobalt powder to the asia pacific battery industry  and increased sales of cobalt extra fine  cobalt briquettes and tungsten powders to the hard metal and alloy markets  offsetting a decrease in copper powders used in automotive applications 
the increase in physical volume of metal products sold is a result of the acquisition of okn and the resulting sales of nickel briquettes and cathodes to the european steel industry 
gross profit increased to million in  a increase from the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the acquisition of okn and the increased volumes of product sold 
cost of products sold increased to of net sales for the year ended from of net sales in as a result of the acquisition of okn with lower value added nickel products and higher sales of lower value added cobalt containing products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in from  resulting primarily from general increases in administrative costs due to the company s growth and the okn acquisition 
due to the relatively low incremental selling  general and administrative expenses required to support okn and relatively high nickel prices  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in compared to of net sales in other expense net was million in compared to million in due primarily to increased interest expense on higher outstanding borrowings  primarily as a result of the okn acquisition  and higher interest rates

the following table summarizes market price fluctuations on the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products market price ranges per pound year ended december  cobalt grade to to nickel to to copper to to pounds of product sold by the company were million pounds during  an increase of compared to million pounds in the increase in physical volume of organic products sold was primarily the result of an increase in sales of cobalt organics and pvc plastic additives  both in europe and asia pacific 
in the inorganic category  the increase in physical volume of products sold reflects higher sales of memory disk and battery grade chemicals in asia pacific 
the increase in physical volume of powder products reflects continued strong growth in sales of cobalt fine powder to the hard metal tool industry  coarse grade powders to the rechargeable battery market and stainless steel alloy powders in automotive applications 
gross profit increased to million in  a increase from the improvement in gross profit was primarily the result of increased volumes and an improved product mix increasing contribution from higher value added products 
cost of products sold decreased to of net sales for the year ended from of net sales in as a result of lower cobalt pricing and improved product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in from of net sales in  resulting from general increases in administrative costs due to the company s growth 
other expense net was million in compared to million in due primarily to increased interest expense on higher outstanding borrowings  primarily as a result of provisional payments made on cobalt copper concentrate and capital expenditures 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes decreased to in from in the lower effective tax rate was due primarily to a higher percentage of income earned in the relatively low statutory tax country of finland and a tax holiday in malaysia 
net income for was million  an increase of million from  primarily due to the aforementioned factors 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company s net working capital increased by approximately million 
this increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of okn 
capital expenditures in were primarily related to the smelter construction project in lubumbashi  democratic republic of congo  which was completed in the fourth quarter  and expansion of plant facilities in finland 
these capital expenditures were funded through cash generated by operations as well as additional borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the acquisition of okn  the company entered into a million senior credit facility with a group of financial institutions including a million limit for issuance of letters of credit 
this senior secured 
table of contents credit facility was comprised of a million revolving credit facility  a million five year term loan and a million seven year term loan 
scheduled maturities on the term loans amounted to million in the company believes that it will have sufficient cash generated by operations and through its credit facilities to provide for its future working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to pay quarterly dividends on its common stock  subject to the board s discretion 
subject to several limitations in its credit facilities  the company may incur additional borrowings under this line to finance working capital and certain capital expenditures  including  without limitation  the purchase of additional raw materials 
the company has ongoing capital expenditure programs to improve its processing technology and plant and equipment  and to expand capacity to accommodate future growth 
the company anticipates that capital spending  exclusive of acquisitions or joint ventures  will approximate million in although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are transacted in us dollars  liabilities for us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices will affect the company s operating results and net income see pages and international operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities 
the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products are cobalt  nickel and copper 
the company s supply of cobalt has historically been sourced primarily from the democratic republic of congo  australia  finland and zambia 
nickel has been sourced primarily from australia and chile 
copper is a worldwide commodity and generally available 
although the company has never experienced a significant shortage of raw materials  production problems and political and civil instability in certain supplier countries may affect their supply and market price 
if a substantial interruption should occur in supply from a primary source  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain as much from other sources as would be necessary to satisfy the company s requirements or at prices comparable to its current arrangements 
the company attempts to mitigate changes in prices and availability by maintaining adequate inventories and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
the cost of raw materials fluctuates due to both actual and perceived changes in supply and demand 
generally  the company is able to pass through to its customers increases and decreases in raw material prices by increasing or decreasing  respectively  the prices of its products 
in addition  in order to hedge the purchase of nickel raw material and the sale of nickel products  the company enters into commodity forward contracts 
the degree of profitability of the company principally depends on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs 
substantial  sustained reductions in the price of raw materials  particularly cobalt and nickel  could also result in the company s inventory being written down to a lower market value 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company predominantly utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of the company s borrowings are in variable rate instruments 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate instruments to fixed rate contracts over typically a three year period 
there is an inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest

the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of the company s long term debt 
expected maturity date december  there fair after total value thousands of dollars long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate expected maturity date december  there fair after total value thousands of dollars long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate in addition to the united states  the company has manufacturing and other facilities in africa  canada  europe and asia pacific  and markets its products worldwide 
although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are transacted in us dollars  liabilities for us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices may affect the company s operating results and net income 
the okn acquisition increased the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through additional euro operating expenses see pages and international operations
