item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global marketer and manufacturer of prestige beauty products 
we have significant direct penetration in the mass retail  mid tier retail and prestige department store channels in the united states  as well as a significant international presence in prestige department stores  perfumeries  boutiques and travel retail locations 
we have established ourselves as a source of over fragrance brands through brand ownership  brand licensing and distribution arrangements 
our portfolio of leading owned and licensed fragrance brands includes elizabeth arden s red door  th avenue  elizabeth arden green tea and sunflowers  elizabeth taylor s white diamonds and passion  white shoulders  geoffrey beene s grey flannel  halston  halston z  ps fine cologne for men  design and wings by giorgio beverly hills 
our skin care brands include elizabeth arden s visible difference  ceramides  and millenium 
our cosmetics products include lipstick  foundation and other color cosmetics products under the elizabeth arden brand name 
in addition to the brands we own and license  we also distribute more than prestige fragrance brands to mass and mid tier retailers in the united states 
on january   we acquired the elizabeth arden business including the elizabeth arden lines of fragrance  skin care and cosmetics  the elizabeth taylor brands of fragrances and the white shoulders fragrance brand  and related assets and liabilities 
our results of operations include eight days of financial results from the elizabeth arden business 
during the fourth quarter  the company recorded integration charges of approximately million pre tax and million after tax 
these charges represent costs related to the integration of the arden business  including the effect of conforming accounting policies related to accounting estimates for accounts receivable and inventory reserves 
in addition  the company has reclassified the results of the business owned prior to the arden acquisition to present warehouse and shipping costs in costs of goods sold 
this reclassification changes gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses  but has no effect on income from operations  ebitda or net income 
both of these changes were implemented to better conform the accounting practices and estimates of the company s business prior to the arden acquisition with the elizabeth arden business acquired and to present our results in a comparable manner to those of other global beauty companies

seasonality our fragrance operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
in fiscal  our net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from its customers  sales and results of operations can vary significantly between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  we expect to experience variability in net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal  and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ending january  significant cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday season orders are received 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
during the fiscal year ended january   we generated million of cash from operating activities 
of that amount  million was generated from operating cash flows  offset by a million increase in working capital including increases in accounts receivable and inventories and decreases in accounts payable partially offset by an increase in other payables and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million 
we used million of the cash generated to purchase property and equipment 
we also used million in cash for the arden acquisition  including the cash portion of the purchase price plus cash expenses due at the closing on january  cash provided from financing activities totaled million and included million from the senior secured notes issued concurrent with the arden acquisition and million borrowed under our new million revolving credit facility with fleet national bank  as administrative agent 
proceeds from conversion of our convertible preferred stock  exercise of warrants and exercise of stock options provided an additional million  and share repurchases and repayment of long term debt used million 
cash and cash equivalents declined by million to million 
during the fiscal year ended january   we generated million in net cash from operating activities 
of that amount  million was generated from working capital  primarily from a reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts payable  and the remaining million from operating cash flows 
we used million of the cash generated to purchase property and equipment 
we also used million we generated from financing activities  including for the repayment of million outstanding under our credit facility  for the retirement of million of long term debt  and for the repurchase of million of our common stock under our share repurchase program 
the remaining million was held in short term investments and increased the cash and cash equivalents on hand to million at the end of the fiscal year ended january  share repurchases 
in fiscal  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program that allows us to purchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
under the terms of the program  which has no expiration date  we may buy stock  from time to time  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other factors 
as of january   we had repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program at an average price of 
our new credit facility restricts future share repurchases under the share repurchase program to million 
in connection with our repurchase in february of the subordinated convertible debenture due owned by our former chairman and a company he controls  the right to convert those debentures into  shares of common stock was extinguished 
future liquidity and capital needs 
we have historically financed  and we expect to continue to finance  our internal growth and acquisitions primarily through internally generated funds  our credit facility and external financing 
our principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  debt service and  additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
as a result of the arden acquisition  our working capital needs have increased significantly 
as a result of the arden acquisition  net sales are expected to more than double from fiscal to fiscal in addition  we did not acquire accounts receivable in the arden acquisition 
future liquidity needs will be dependent upon the growth of current assets principally accounts receivable and inventory and current liabilities principally accrued expenses and accounts payable 
additional inventory requirements and accounts receivable may have a significant impact on our liquidity 
our credit facility is secured by a first priority perfected lien on all of our us inventory and accounts receivable  and borrowing availability under the credit facility is limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
we believe that internally generated funds and available financing under our credit facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital and debt service requirements for the next twelve months other than additional working capital requirements which may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands or new product distribution arrangements 
we have discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding our possible acquisition of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although we periodically execute routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that we will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of our operations 
the characteristics of our business do not generally require us to make significant ongoing capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended january   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily relating to computer software and hardware costs and the purchase of tools and molds and warehouse equipment 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended january  will be approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
as of january   we had approximately million outstanding under our credit facility subject to variable rates 
as a result of the arden acquisition  we replaced our million credit facility with a million credit facility for working capital needs 
furthermore  our borrowings under our credit facility are seasonal with peak borrowings in the third quarter of our fiscal year 
accordingly  our january  earnings and cash flow will be affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense for the year ended january   would increase by approximately  to date  we have not engaged in derivative transactions to mitigate interest rate risk as most of our debt bears a fixed rate 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions that would mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effect  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct our business in various regions of the world  and export and import products to and from several companies 
as a result of the arden acquisition  we estimate that approximately of our net sales will be generated outside the united states in fiscal  in a variety of currencies including the euro  british pound  swiss franc and australian dollar 
our operations may  therefore  be subject to volatility because of currency fluctuations  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in these countries 
sales and expenses are frequently denominated in local currencies  and results of operations may be affected adversely as currency fluctuations affect our product prices and operating costs or those of our competitors 
we intend to engage in hedging operations  including forward foreign exchange contracts  to reduce the exposure of our cash flows to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we will not engage in hedging for speculative investment reasons 
our historical results do not reflect any foreign exchange hedging activity 
there can be no assurance that our hedging operations will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating currencies 
our results of operations are reported in us dollars 
a weakening of the currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated may decrease our operating profits or cash flow 
in all jurisdictions in which we operate  we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment  foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 
these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars
