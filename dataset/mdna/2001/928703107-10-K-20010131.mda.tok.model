fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks results of operations summary net sales in fiscal increased by million  or  to billion in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from an increase in sales to unaffiliated customers by the telecommunications services segment of million and by the electronic publication and typesetting systems segment of million  which were partially offset by decreases in sales for the other three segments 
the company s income before taxes and minority interests increased by million  or  to million in fiscal the operating profit of the company s segments increased by million  or  to million in fiscal while the staffing services segment  the telecommunications services segment  and the computer systems segment increased their operating profits and the electronic publication and typesetting systems segment reduced its operating loss  an operating loss in the telephone directory segment partially offset these improvements 
consolidated fiscal results included recognition of a previously deferred gain on the sale of a joint venture of million see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
net income in fiscal was million  compared to net income of million in fiscal results of operations segments sales of the staffing services segment decreased by million  or  while its operating profit increased by million  or  to million  compared with million in fiscal the sales decrease was caused by a reduction in managed services revenue of million  or  due primarily to an increase in the number of associate vendors who have agreed to be paid subject to the receipt of the customers payment to the company  resulting in the amounts associated with such revenue being excluded from sales  as well as a reduction in the use of associate vendors by one of the company s largest managed services clients 
these revenue decreases were offset  in part  by an increase in sales of million  or  in traditional staffing business 
operating margins rose from to for the entire segment and from to excluding managed services revenue 
an increased mix of higher margin recruited business in both the technical and commercial divisions of the segment and strong growth in permanent placements contributed to higher margins and higher operating profit for this segment 
however  there can be no assurances that this improvement will continue 
some of the segment s customers are large  and the loss of any large contract could have a negative effect on this segment s business unless  and until  the business is replaced 
although the markets for the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year compared to fiscal year continued results of operations segments continued segment s services include a broad range of industries throughout the united states  general economic difficulties in specific geographic areas or industrial sectors have in the past  and could in the future affect  the profitability of this segment 
the telephone directory segment s sales decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal it incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared with an operating profit of million in fiscal the sales decrease was primarily due to decreases in the segment s viewtech division sales of million  telephone production sales of million and printing sales in uruguay of million  substantially offset by an increase in independent directory publishing sales of million  which included the publication of the segment s toll free directory 
the operating loss was the result of significantly higher expenditures for various strategic investments in new and existing markets and a restructuring of the segment designed to increase future advertising revenue and enhance the long term value and profits of its independent yellow page publishing business 
additionally  the segment s decreased sales and a charge of million for a viewtech customer receivable deemed uncollectable due to a bankruptcy filing added to the operating loss

the telecommunications services segment s sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and its operating profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal all of the segment s divisions reported significant increases in sales as a result of increased revenues from long haul fiber optic projects and cross connect box projects  as well as additional increased business from several major customers 
the increase in operating profit was the result of the increase in sales and a decrease in overhead of percentage points partially offset by a decrease in gross margins of percentage points  primarily due to amounts recorded for cost overruns on one of the business systems division s projects  a settlement of differences on out of scope billing on a project with another customer  the completion of certain low margin government contract work and integration costs for the lucent wired services division acquired in late december a substantial portion of the business in these segments is obtained through the submission of competitive proposals for contracts that typically expire within one year and are re bid

the computer systems segment s sales decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal while its operating profit increased by  to million from million in fiscal the sales decrease was primarily due to the recognition in fiscal of revenues related to a contract for an operator services system in holland  which was accounted for under the completed contract method of accounting

the electronic publication and typesetting systems segment s sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal and its operating loss decreased by million  or  to million 
the increase in sales resulted from higher domestic and international sales of systems and equipment  primarily due to sales of the segment s new data storage products to domestic oem customers and sales of the segment s new wide computer to plate imagers to latin american and european customers 
the decrease in operating loss was due to the increase in sales  an increase in service and support gross margins of percentage points due to lower spare parts and warranty costs  partially offset by a decrease in systems and equipment gross margins of percentage points due to higher manufacturing costs and price discounting in response to competition

item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk exposure in the following areas interest rate market risk the company has cash equivalents on which interest income is earned at variable rates 
the company also has credit lines with various domestic and foreign banks  which provide for unsecured borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of million 
at november   the company had borrowings totaling million outstanding under these agreements 
the interest rates on these borrowings are variable and therefore interest expense and interest income are affected by the general level of us and foreign interest rates 
increases in interest expense resulting from an increase in interest rates could impact the company s results of operations 
for example  a increase in prevailing interest rates could cause interest expense to increase by million 
the company s policy is to take actions that would mitigate such risk when appropriate 
in march  the company entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted million of its million of long term debt  through maturity  from fixed to floating rate debt 
therefore  interest expense on the debt was affected by the general level of interest rates

at november   the company had purchased foreign currency options in the aggregate notional amount of million  which approximated its exposure in foreign currencies at that date 
the company does not believe that it is exposed to material foreign exchange market risk
