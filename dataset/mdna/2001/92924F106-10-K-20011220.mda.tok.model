item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of wgl holdings  inc wgl holdings or the company and its subsidiaries under the corporate structure that was in place during the fiscal year ended september  effective november   washington gas light company washington gas reorganized  such that washington gas and its subsidiaries became separate subsidiaries of wgl holdings  a newly formed holding company established under the public utility holding company act of note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the new holding company structure 
since the former subsidiaries of washington gas are now subsidiaries of wgl holdings  the consolidated results for washington gas for fiscal years and  which are also presented in this annual report are comparable to the consolidated results for wgl holdings for fiscal year the glossary of key terms on page defines certain terms used in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bold italics indicate the first reference to a defined term 
safe harbor for forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  excluding historical information  may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to the outlook for earnings  revenues  and other future financial business performance or strategies and expectations 
forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as  but not limited to  estimates  expects  anticipates  intends  believes  plans  and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  and could 
although the company believes such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot give assurance that every objective will be reached 
forward looking statements speak only as of today  and the company assumes no duty to update them 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance changes in economic  competitive  political and regulatory conditions and developments  changes in capital and energy commodity market conditions  changes in relevant laws and regulations  including tax  environmental and employment laws and regulations  weather conditions  legislative  regulatory and judicial mandates and decisions  timing and success of business and product development efforts  technological improvements  the pace of deregulation efforts and the availability of other competitive alternatives  and other uncertainties 
such factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond the company s direct control 
accordingly  while it believes that the assumptions are reasonable  the company cannot ensure that all expectations and objectives will be realized 
the company urges readers to use care and consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors that could affect the company s business as described in this annual report 
all forward looking statements made in this annual report rely upon the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of overview wgl holdings  through its subsidiaries  sells and delivers natural gas and provides a variety of energy related products and services to customers in the metropolitan washington  dc  maryland  virginia areas and beyond 
the company s core subsidiary  washington gas  is involved in the distribution and sale of natural gas that is primarily regulated by state regulatory commissions 
in response to changes in federal and state regulation  the company has taken the initiative to offer competitively priced natural gas and electricity to customers through its unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiary 
the company also offers energy related products and services that are closely related to its core business 
the majority of these energy related activities are performed by wholly owned subsidiaries of washington gas resources corp 
washington gas resources 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  wgl holdings reported on four major business segments regulated utility  retail energy marketing  heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac  and consumer financing 
these four segments are described below regulated utility 
with over percent of the company s assets  washington gas delivers natural gas to retail customers in accordance with tariffs set by regulatory commissions that have regional jurisdiction over washington gas s rates 
these rates provide the regulated utility an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return for the service on the investment devoted to the delivery of natural gas to customers 
washington gas also sells the natural gas commodity to customers who either have not yet elected to purchase gas from unregulated third party marketers or are not yet eligible to make this choice 
the regulated utility does not incur a profit or a loss when it sells the natural gas commodity as utility customers are charged for the natural gas commodity at the same cost it incurs  subject to routine regulatory reviews of the reasonableness of these costs 
retail energy marketing 
washington gas energy services  inc wgeservices  a wholly owned subsidiary of washington gas resources  competes with other third party marketers by selling natural gas and electricity directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers  both inside and outside of the regulated utility s traditional service territory 
wgeservices has the opportunity to make a profit or the potential to incur a loss from these sales 
while wgeservices markets the natural gas and electricity commodities  regulated utilities are required to deliver the commodities to their customers 
in the near term  wgeservices will focus on expanding its customer base while seeking to generate positive earnings by controlling customer acquisition costs 
on a long term basis wgeservices believes the current strategy will enable the development of a significant customer base with the related volumes 
as the customer base and volumes grow  wgeservices expects customer acquisition costs as a percentage of revenues to decline 
wgeservices anticipates that this should enable it to generate higher levels of net income as the business evolves from its current stage 
hvac 
two wholly owned subsidiaries  washington gas energy systems  inc wgesystems and american combustion industries  inc aci  provide turnkey design build renovation projects to the commercial and government markets 
through a percent equity investment in primary investors  llc primary investors  the hvac segment also installs  repairs and maintains hvac and plumbing equipment in the residential and light commercial markets 
the commercial hvac business has grown dramatically as a result of strong repeat and add on business from successful completion of many projects 
the segment focuses on retrofitting the area s large number of aging commercial and government structures 
factors critical to the commercial hvac success include the ability to maintain and grow the backlog of existing work through diversification of the market segments these subsidiaries serve 
balance between governmental and private sector work should allow these subsidiaries to succeed despite changes that might occur in general economic conditions 
wgl holdings owns a percent investment in primary investors that owns a residential hvac business 
primary investors has acquired nine companies and is striving to grow its level of sales while continuing to work on improving the integration of the important activities of the entities acquired 
consumer financing 
washington gas historically offered financing for customers to purchase natural gas appliances and other energy related equipment 
in august  the company determined that the consumer financing segment could not meet the strategic objectives of the company s business plan and thus ceased making any new loans 
it continues servicing of existing loans 
this segment has maintained a minimal staff to carry out this function 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows with specific information on liquidity and capital resources 
it also includes management s interpretation of the company s past financial results  potential factors that may affect future results and potential risks in the years ahead and approaches used to manage them 
results of operations net income was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company earned percent  percent and percent  respectively  on average common equity during these three fiscal years 
the following table summarizes the net income for each segment at september   and composition of net income year ended september  thousands regulated utility a retail energy marketing hvac commercial residential residential impairment provision consumer financing other net income a regulated utility results include million  million and million of expenses shown in note to the consolidated financial statements under the caption eliminations other for fiscal years   and  respectively 
basic and diluted earnings per average common share were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
a june public sale of common stock increased the number of shares outstanding by  which reduced the earnings per average common share by in fiscal year from the prior year results 
significant factors that affected the company s earnings included winter weather 
during the fiscal year  winter weather was approximately percent colder than normal  which increased utility earnings by per share 
utility customer base 
washington gas continues to expand its customer base 
during fiscal year  customer meters increased by percent over the prior fiscal year 
operation and maintenance expenses 
utility operation and maintenance expenses for fiscal year increased million over the same period last year principally reflecting a million increase in the utility segment s uncollectible accounts expense due to the impact higher natural gas prices and colder weather had on outstanding accounts receivable balances 
in addition  labor related expenses increased by million due primarily to a percent rise in the regulated utility s workforce over the preceding year s level 
tempering these increases was a million decrease in pension and post retirement benefits expense 
operation and maintenance expenses in fiscal year decreased million from the decrease was primarily the result of reduced pension and postretirement benefit expenses and the reduction in fiscal year in the level of year and other technology related costs incurred in fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense 
in fiscal years and  depreciation and amortization expense increased over the prior year by million and million  respectively 
these increases primarily reflect depreciation associated with the company s increased investment in property  plant and equipment 
the larger increase in fiscal year reflects additional amortization of a new enterprise wide software system completed in fiscal year non utility operations 
the net income contributed by the company s recurring non utility operations decreased million during fiscal year  approximately per average common share from fiscal year results 
in fiscal year  recurring net income from the company s non utility activities decreased million  approximately per average common share from fiscal year results 
nonrecurring transactions 
the company s earnings for the three reported years include a number of nonrecurring items 
fiscal year results include a million after tax per average common share permanent impairment provision on its percent owned residential hvac investment  a million pre tax million after tax or per average common share reserve for potential refunds on regulated utility customer bills recorded in operation and maintenance expenses and a million pre tax million after tax or per average common share adjustment for a virginia business license tax recorded by the regulated utility in general taxes 
fiscal year results include a million after tax gain from the sale of two minor non utility assets 
fiscal year results include a million after tax gain from a subsidiary s sale of undeveloped land  offset by a million after tax loss from the sale of natural gas utility assets located in west virginia 
the following table summarizes the net income and earnings per average common share that were produced by the company s recurring operations during fiscal years  and net income from recurring operations years ended september  net income from recurring operations millions earnings per average common share from recurring operations interest expense 
during fiscal year  interest expense rose by million primarily because of an increase in the average balance of total debt outstanding and a lower allowance for funds used during construction afudc  tempered by lower short term interest rates 
long term debt was principally used to fund the utility segment s ongoing construction program to support customer growth and replace facilities of existing customers 
additional short term debt issued during fiscal year was used to fund a higher volume and cost of storage gas balances  increased customer accounts receivable  and higher levels of unrecovered gas costs as compared with fiscal year regulated utility operating results this section describes the detailed results of the company s consolidated regulated utility operations in the district of columbia  maryland  virginia and west virginia 
during fiscal years  and  utility operations contributed  and  respectively  toward basic and diluted earnings per average common share 
utility net revenues utility net revenues increased by million or percent in fiscal year  and increased by million or percent in fiscal year the growth in utility net revenues in fiscal year resulted primarily from a percent increase in firm therm deliveries  reflecting percent colder weather in fiscal year and a percent rise in customer meters 
firm therm deliveries rose percent in fiscal year as weather in fiscal year was very similar to fiscal year and the number of customers increased by percent 
the following table provides the factors contributing to the changes in net revenues between years 
composition of utility net revenue changes increase decrease over prior year millions gas delivered to firm customers volumes gas delivered to interruptible customers other rights of way fees other changes total gas delivered to firm customers 
during fiscal years and  deliveries to the utility s firm customers increased by million therms and million therms  respectively  over the prior year s results 
these increases include therms identified as firm in the selected financial and operations data on page  under the captions gas sold and delivered and gas delivered for others 
these increases primarily reflect the impact of colder weather in fiscal year  and the increase in customer meters in both years as mentioned above 
winter weather  which typically can cause significant changes in the level of natural gas delivered to firm customers  was colder during the fiscal year and comparable in fiscal years and as a result  winter weather had a significant impact on the changes in firm therm deliveries in fiscal year increased gas prices drove utility revenues up sharply in fiscal year however  since the regulated utility passes the cost of the natural gas commodity onto customers without a mark up  rising gas prices during fiscal year  did not affect the regulated utility s net revenue 
the regulated utility s rates are based on normal winter weather and none of the tariffs for the jurisdictions in which it operates include a weather normalization provision 
however  the regulated utility does have declining block rates in its maryland and virginia jurisdictions that reduce the impact that deviations from normal winter weather have on net revenues 
gas delivered to interruptible customers 
deliveries to interruptible customers during fiscal year decreased by million therms or percent from the fiscal year level  which resulted in a million decline in net revenues from interruptible customers 
the decline reflects a number of interruptible customers who have elected to switch to firm service or customers who have found alternate energy sources as a result of the relatively high cost of natural gas experienced during the winter of fiscal year deliveries to interruptible customers in fiscal year decreased by million therms or percent from fiscal year levels 
this decrease reflects the absence of million retail therm sales and deliveries to the regulated utility s former west virginia operations and a brief planned interruption associated with the change over to year as in fiscal year  a number of interruptible customers elected to switch to firm service in fiscal year other 
the other net revenue category includes rights of way fees  amounts generated from optimizing the value of the company s contractual assets for transportation and storage of natural gas on the interstate pipelines  wholesale deliveries to the current owner of the company s former west virginia utility operation  and miscellaneous other operating revenues that are not associated with the volume of gas sold 
other net revenues increased by million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year  over the preceding years results 
included in the increase in net revenues in fiscal year over are million of revenues the utility is collecting from newly enacted rights of way fees in the district of columbia and increased proceeds from asset optimization agreements of million 
the regulated utility is allowed recovery of the rights of way fees from its customers and therefore these fees do not affect net income 
the regulated utility sells and or delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in maryland  which are each owned by separate companies independent of washington gas 
variations in the volumes of deliveries to these two customers have little impact on the regulated utility s net revenues and net income because of a margin sharing arrangement in maryland 
under that arrangement  the regulated utility calculates the gross margins  less related expenses  and the cost to recover the regulated utility s investment in the facilities constructed to serve these two customers 
most of the remaining gross margins from these customers are used to reduce firm customers rates 
during fiscal years and  deliveries to these customers decreased by million therms percent and increased by therms percent  respectively 
during fiscal year  one of these customers had an operational problem that precluded it from receiving delivery of alternate fossil fuels it typically includes in its generation mix 
that operational problem was corrected early in fiscal year and  therefore  deliveries in returned to more normal levels 
cost of gas 
the regulated utility s cost of natural gas includes both fixed and variable components 
the regulated utility pays the fixed costs or demand charges to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas 
the regulated utility pays the variable costs  or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself  to natural gas producers 
variations in the regulated utility s cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes  the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms 
under these regulated recovery mechanisms  the regulated utility defers the difference between the firm gas costs it pays and the gas costs recovered from customers 
in subsequent periods  the regulated utility recovers from  or refunds to  customers any differences 
therefore  increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no effect on net revenues and net income 
the regulated utility s average cost of gas on a per therm basis  excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to sales made outside of the regulated utility s service territory  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase reflects higher commodity gas prices in the current year associated with the greater demand caused by the extremely cold weather 
the commodity cost of gas invoiced to the regulated utility and included in these levels  was and per therm for fiscal years and  respectively 
the regulated utility s average cost of gas on a per therm basis increased to per therm in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in primarily reflects moderately higher commodity gas prices in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the average commodity cost of gas invoiced to the regulated utility in fiscal year also increased to from per therm in fiscal year because of higher commodity gas prices 
other utility operating expenses operation and maintenance expenses increased million or percent in fiscal year and decreased million or percent in fiscal year from the prior years results 
the increase in operation and maintenance expenses in fiscal year reduced earnings per average common share by over fiscal year and increased earnings per average common share by in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in operation and maintenance expenses 
composition of operation and maintenance expense changes increase decrease over prior year millions uncollectible accounts operating unit and other expenses non labor nonrecurring reserve for customer billing refunds labor and labor related expenses pension and postretirement medical and life insurance benefit expenses technological initiatives total the allowance for uncollectible accounts  which increased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year  represented over percent of the increase in operation and maintenance expenses 
higher natural gas costs and colder weather in fiscal year worked in tandem to increase customer bills 
consequently  the provision for uncollectible accounts rose to reflect the impact of higher accounts receivable balances in fiscal year labor and labor related expenses increased primarily because of a rise in the amount of employee wages and performance based incentive awards that were accrued during fiscal year the number of employees increased in fiscal year to  utility employees 
the successful investment performance of the company s pension fund  which is reflected in pension and postretirement medical and life insurance benefit expenses  produced a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses in fiscal year  although not as large as the decline experienced in fiscal year during fiscal year  the regulated utility implemented enhanced resource allocation measures that spanned nearly every aspect of the utility s operations  including the delivery service  advertising and business development functions 
these improvements support the utility s efforts to maintain high quality  safe and reliable service 
the million decrease in operating unit and other expenses non labor reflects those improvements 
in fiscal year  the regulated utility embarked on several initiatives that caused operating unit expenses to rise 
these initiatives were focused on process improvements that enhance utility operations 
fiscal year operation and maintenance expense includes a nonrecurring charge of million million after tax or per average common share to reserve for a potential customer billing refund identified during the year 
during fiscal years and  depreciation and amortization rose by million percent and million percent  respectively 
the increases reflect additions of million and million  respectively  to property  plant and equipment that were made to meet continuing customer growth and to upgrade or replace existing facilities and systems 
depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal years  and included million  million  and million respectively  of amortization related to the company s new enterprise wide software system that was completed in the second half of fiscal year the regulated utility s composite depreciation rate was percent in both fiscal years and  compared to percent in fiscal year general taxes increased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year the newly implemented district of columbia rights of way fees  which are being collected in rates  generated most of this increase 
the consolidated statements of income taxes on page detail the composition of the change in income tax expense 
notable in the computation of income taxes is the assessment of an income tax on utility operations in maryland and virginia effective october  and january   respectively 
non utility operating results during fiscal years   and  wgl holdings reported on three primary unregulated operating segments retail energy marketing  hvac  and consumer financing 
these segments  plus the impact of other incidental unregulated activities  posted a loss of per basic and diluted average common share in fiscal year  and contributed and per basic and diluted average common share in fiscal years and  respectively 
these results include a million non recurring permanent impairment provision for residential hvac in fiscal year and million and million of nonrecurring after tax gains from the sales of minor non utility assets in fiscal years and  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of these and other items  the unregulated segments contributed   and  of basic and diluted earnings per average common share in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the following table shows the composition of the changes in revenue for these non utility operating segments 
composition of non utility revenue changes increase decrease over prior year millions retail energy marketing hvac commercial consumer financing other non utility total the following discussion describes the results of operations for each of the three reported non utility segments 
retail energy marketing 
the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices comprises the company s retail energy marketing segment 
established in  wgeservices sells natural gas on an unregulated competitive basis directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers and  beginning in fiscal year  also sells electricity in competition with electricity marketers 
revenues for this segment have grown over the past three years and were million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the retail energy marketing segment expanded its gas customer base by  customers to  over the prior year and provided electricity to  new customers 
wgeservices has experienced a steady increase in the volume of gas it sold  with billion cubic feet bcf sold in fiscal year  bcf in fiscal year  and bcf in fiscal year in addition to gas sales  wgeservices also sold billion kilowatt hours of electricity in its initial year of sales 
wgeservices aggressive marketing strategies  the growing participation of customers in various customer choice pilot programs  and its initial entry into electricity sales generated the significant growth in wgeservices revenues  customer base and volumes sold 
net loss from the retail energy marketing segment was million in fiscal year  compared to net income of million in fiscal year  and net income of million in fiscal year in fiscal year  wgeservices made its initial entry into the retail electricity markets and as a result incurred significant expenses to acquire the  new customers 
the fiscal year net loss also reflects a natural gas market with rising gas prices during the early part of the year 
since wgeservices sells natural gas at a constant price over the term of its contracts  the shape of the forward price curve for natural gas purchases will cause gross margins to widen and narrow over time 
as gas prices rise  wgeservices generates narrower margins as it locks in customer sales and matches them with purchased volumes 
conversely  in periods of declining gas prices  such as fiscal year  wgeservices was able to lock in higher margins 
electricity is purchased under a full requirements contract from the owner of several large power plants located near the company s retail electric customers 
gross margins were positive in all periods  with the level of marketing expenses significantly affecting comparative net income 
hvac 
two subsidiaries  aci and wgesystems  which offer large scale hvac installations and related services to commercial and government customers  are included in the company s primary hvac activities 
in addition  the company has a percent equity investment in primary investors  a limited liability company that focuses on investments in companies that provide products and services to residential and light commercial hvac customers see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues from commercial hvac activities were million in fiscal year  growing percent from the prior year 
the growth was the result of an increase in the number and size of commercial design and build projects  primarily for two major customers 
revenues from these two major customers collectively represented percent of total revenue for fiscal year and percent for fiscal year revenues for fiscal year from these two customers are expected to decline from fiscal year levels 
in fiscal year  revenues from commercial hvac activities were million reflecting an increase of million or percent over fiscal year results 
net income from commercial hvac activities was million in fiscal year and contributed to earnings per average common share 
net income increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  reflecting continued attractive revenue growth combined with controlled costs 
the company s percent equity investment in primary investors resulted in a million after tax loss from operations excluding the million permanent impairment provision discussed below in fiscal year  a million after tax loss in fiscal year  and a negligible loss in fiscal year in september  management recorded a million non cash permanent impairment provision based on primary investors operating results since its inception and its outlook for the future 
the company  along with its co investor  thayer capital partners  has initiated several measures to attempt to turnaround this investment  including the retention of a new senior management team 
the net loss incurred by primary investors during fiscal year was mostly due to insufficient sales levels and its inability to fully realize the integration synergies of its nine acquired companies 
the company anticipates future reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of recent initiatives 
key success factors for primary investors will include its ability to raise the level of its sales consistent with expectations while delivering on anticipated efficiencies from process improvements and integration 
the net loss incurred by primary investors during fiscal year resulted from a relatively high level of integration costs  combined with cool summer weather that lowered the demand for hvac products and services 
through september   wgl holdings had invested million in primary investors and its remaining investment using the equity method of accounting is million  including million of recorded income tax benefits 
consumer financing 
this business segment offered financing for residential and small commercial customers to purchase gas appliances and other energy related equipment 
the consumer financing segment sold  with recourse  receivables that resulted from these financing arrangements to financial institutions 
in august  the company determined that the consumer financing segment could not meet its business objectives and thus ceased the procurement of any new loans 
it continues to service existing loans and maintains a minimal staff to oversee this function 
although revenue increased by percent from the prior year  the segment posted a million net loss  which includes severance related expenses for exiting employees as well as an increased provision for uncollectible accounts 
in fiscal year  net income from this segment was million compared to million in fiscal year  reflecting a lower volume of contracts sold by the company to financial institutions  in addition to an increase in interest rates charged by those financial institutions compared to the prior year 
interest expense total interest expense increased by million or percent in fiscal year and million or percent in fiscal year approximately percent of interest expense is applicable to utility segment operations 
the following table shows the components of the changes in interest expense between years 
composition of interest expense changes increase decrease from prior year millions long term debt short term debt other total long term debt 
the million increase in interest expense on long term debt during fiscal year reflects a million increase in the average balance of long term debt outstanding  and a percentage point increase in the weighted average cost of such debt 
the million increase in interest expense on long term debt during fiscal year primarily resulted from a million increase in the average balance of long term debt outstanding  partially offset by a percentage point decline in the weighted average cost of such debt 
the retirement of million of first mortgage bonds at a weighted average interest rate of percent during fiscal year  partially offset by the issuance of million in medium term notes mtns at a weighted average rate of percent during fiscal year  was the primary reason for the decline in the average long term debt cost during fiscal year the embedded cost of long term debt was percent  percent and percent at september   and  respectively 
short term debt 
the million increase in interest expense on short term debt during fiscal year reflects a million increase in the average balance of short term debt outstanding  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the weighted average cost of such debt 
the million increase in interest expense on short term debt during fiscal year results from a million rise in the average balance of short term debt and a percentage point increase in the weighted average cost of such debt 
see short term cash requirements and related financing for a discussion of fluctuations in short term debt balances 
other 
other interest expense increased million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year  due primarily to a decrease in the accrual for afudc 
the decreased accrual for afudc reflects a decline in average construction work in progress due to the completion of a number of capital projects during each of the fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a goal to maintain its common equity ratio in the mid percent range of total consolidated capital 
in addition  the company has a general policy to reduce short term debt balances in the spring  because a significant portion of the company s current assets are converted into cash at the end of the heating season 
accomplishing these objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to preserve the company s and its regulated utility subsidiary s credit ratings and to allow access to capital at relatively low costs 
at september   total consolidated capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  was comprised of percent common equity  percent preferred stock and percent long term debt 
short term cash requirements and related financing the regulated utility s business is weather sensitive and seasonal 
in fiscal year  approximately percent of the total therms delivered in the regulated utility s franchise area excluding deliveries to two electric generation facilities were made in the first and second fiscal quarters 
this weather sensitivity causes short term cash requirements to vary significantly during the year 
cash requirements peak in the fall and winter months when accounts receivable  accrued utility revenues and storage gas inventories are at their highest levels 
after the winter heating season  these assets convert into cash  which the company generally uses to reduce short term debt and acquire storage gas for the next heating season 
storage gas represents gas purchased from producers and is primarily stored in facilities owned by interstate pipelines 
both the regulated utility and the retail energy marketing segment maintain storage gas inventory 
the regulated utility generally pays for storage gas between heating seasons and withdraws it during the heating season 
significant variations in storage balances at september  are usually caused by the price paid to producers and marketers  which is a function of short term market fluctuations in gas costs 
for the regulated utility such costs are a component of the cost of gas recovered from customers 
in addition  the regulated utility is able to reflect changes in carrying costs related to the level of storage gas inventory in the amount it recovers from its customers in two of the three jurisdictions in which it operates 
variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the regulated utility s gas cost recovery mechanisms and the level of refunds from pipeline companies that will be returned to customers can significantly affect short term cash requirements 
at september   the regulated utility had a million net under collection of gas costs  compared to a million net over collection at september  the company reflects the amounts under collected and over collected in the captions gas costs due from customers and gas costs due to customers  respectively in the consolidated balance sheets 
the change from the prior year is primarily due to the significant increase in the cost of gas which the regulated utility was unable to pass on to its customers on a timely basis in fiscal year most of the current balance will be collected from  or returned to  customers in fiscal year at september   and  refunds received from pipelines that are being returned to the regulated utility s customers were not material 
the company uses short term debt in the form of commercial paper and unsecured short term bank loans to fund seasonal requirements 
alternate sources at september   include unsecured lines of credit  some of which are seasonal  a million revolving credit agreement for washington gas light company and a million revolving credit agreement for wgl holdings  each maintained with a group of banks 
the company can activate these financing options to support or replace its commercial paper 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information regarding the company s short term borrowing capabilities 
at september   the company had notes payable outstanding of million  compared to million outstanding at september  the decrease in notes payable from the prior year was primarily due to the company s application of proceeds from the issuance of million of common stock in june the decrease was partially offset by the financing of the previously mentioned million net under collection of gas costs and a larger customer accounts receivable balance 
at september   current maturities of long term debt were million 
long term cash requirements and related financing the company s long term cash requirements primarily depend upon the level of capital expenditures  long term debt maturity requirements and decisions to refinance long term debt 
the company devotes the majority of its capital expenditures to adding new regulated utility customers in its existing service area 
at september   washington gas was authorized to issue up to million of long term debt over approximately two years under an existing shelf registration 
note to the consolidated financial statements further discusses the nature of the company s long term debt 
cash flow from operating activities 
in fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in fiscal year this change primarily reflects increased amounts needed to fund a significant rise in gas costs due from customers  an increase in other prepayments and a reduction in accounts payable 
partially offsetting these uses of cash in fiscal year was a million increase in net income  adjusted for non cash items  and a decrease in cash used to fund storage gas inventories 
in fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in fiscal year this change primarily reflects increased amounts needed to fund higher levels of customer accounts receivable  accrued utility revenues and storage gas inventories 
partially offsetting these uses of cash in fiscal year was a million increase in net income  adjusted for non cash items  and an increase in the level of accounts payable related primarily to gas cost increases 
cash flow from financing activities 
during fiscal year  the issuance of  shares of common stock  a percent increase  generated million 
the company is using the proceeds for general corporate purposes of the regulated utility including capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
since august  all stock required for the dividend reinvestment plan drp and employee savings plans has been acquired from open market purchases 
thus  the drp and employee savings plans were not a source of funds during fiscal year in fiscal year  the company raised million from the issuance of common stock  which included million shares  or million  from a secondary issuance 
the following table shows the issuance and retirement of long term debt that occurred during fiscal years  and for additional information regarding this debt issuance  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt activity millions  except interest interest interest percentages rate amount rate amount rate amount first mortgage bonds retired medium term notes issued retired project financing net other various various various total the dividends paid by on common stock by the company during fiscal year increased by million over fiscal year due primarily to the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock in june see note to the consolidated financial statements and a increase per common share paid during the current fiscal year 
cash flow from investing activities 
capital expenditures for fiscal years  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
investments in new business construction  which include amounts invested to convert customers from other energy sources  result in the capacity to deliver additional therms 
during fiscal years  and  capital expenditures for new business equaled million  million and million  respectively  which represented percent  percent and percent of each year s respective total capital expenditures 
in addition  the company made equity investments in primary investors of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the company received million  from the sales of minor non utility investments 
in fiscal year  the company received million from the sale of both utility and non utility assets 
during fiscal year  the sum of net income and non cash charges  less dividends on common stock totaled million  representing percent of capital expenditures and investments 
for fiscal years and  respectively  the sum of net income and non cash charges  less dividends on common stock  totaled million and million and represented percent and percent of capital expenditures plus investments 
sales of accounts receivable during fiscal year  the company augmented cash flow by selling million of certain non utility accounts receivable from its consumer financing segment to commercial banks 
similar sales of non utility accounts receivable in fiscal years and amounted to million and million  respectively

capital expenditures actual projected millions total new business replacements other total competition competition with other energy products in its core business  the company s regulated utility subsidiary  washington gas  faces competition based on customers preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
currently  the most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential market 
the residential market generates a substantial proportion of the regulated utility s net income 
in its service territory  washington gas continues to attract the majority of the new residential construction market 
the company believes that consumers continuing preference for natural gas allows washington gas to maintain a strong presence 
historically  the regulated utility has generally maintained a price advantage over electricity in its service area 
increases in the price of the natural gas commodity during the winter of fiscal year altered this situation somewhat 
however  by the end of fiscal year natural gas prices have settled to more traditional levels 
furthermore  as discussed below  restructuring in both the natural gas and electric industries is leading to changes in traditional pricing models 
as part of the electric industry restructuring effort  certain business segments are moving toward market based pricing  with third party marketers of electricity participating in retail markets 
electric industry restructuring may result in lower comparative pricing for electric service and other alternative energy sources  including natural gas 
these changes will result in increased competition for the regulated utility 
in the interruptible market  the regulated utility s customers must be capable of using a fuel other than natural gas when demand by the regulated utility s firm customers peaks 
fuel oil is the most significant competing energy alternative to natural gas 
the regulated utility s success in this market depends largely on the relationship between gas and oil prices 
because the supply of natural gas is primarily derived from domestic sources  the relationship between supply and demand generally has the greatest impact on natural gas prices 
as a large portion of oil comes from foreign sources  political events can have significant influences on oil supplies and accordingly  oil prices 
deregulation in each of the jurisdictions maryland  virginia and the district of columbia served by the company s regulated utility  regulators and utilities have implemented customer choice programs 
these programs provide customers with an opportunity to choose to purchase their natural gas and or electric commodity from third party marketers  rather than purchasing these commodities as part of a bundled service from the local utility 
when customers choose to purchase their natural gas commodity from a third party marketer  there is no impact on the regulated utility s net revenues or net income because washington gas passes the cost of gas to customers without any mark up 
however  these customer choice programs provide unregulated third party marketers  such as wgeservices  with opportunities to profit from the sale of the natural gas commodity or electricity in competitive markets through energy sales to an expanding customer base 
participating in this rapidly evolving marketplace also poses new risks and challenges discussed below that must be addressed in the company s current and future strategies 
the natural gas delivery function the natural gas delivery function  the company s regulated utility s core business  continues to be regulated by local regulatory commissions 
in developing this core business  washington gas has invested over billion to construct a safe  reliable and economical natural gas distribution system 
because of the high costs and important safety and environmental considerations associated with building and operating a duplicate distribution system  societal interests will continue to prefer allowing only one owner and operator of a natural gas distribution system per franchise area for the foreseeable future 
the nature of washington gas s customer base and the distance of most customers from interstate pipelines mitigate the threat of bypass of its facilities by other potential delivery service providers 
washington gas expects that local regulatory commissions will continue to set the prices and terms for delivery service that give it an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on the capital invested in its distribution system and to recover reasonable operating expenses 
washington gas plans to continue constructing  operating and maintaining its natural gas distribution system 
the company does not foresee any near term changes in the regulated utility s risk profile 
the merchant function and natural gas unbundling the implementation of customer choice programs for natural gas customers is well underway in maryland  virginia and the district of columbia 
currently  over half of the customers served by washington gas are eligible to participate in customer choice programs and the company expects that these programs will fully encompass all customers in its service territory by january  out of the more than  customers eligible to participate in these programs at september   nearly  customers purchase their natural gas commodity from unregulated third party marketers 
ultimately  the company recognizes the regulated utility may play a smaller role in the merchant function and may eventually exit the merchant function should all customers buy natural gas from unregulated marketers 
during this transition period  the company continues to fulfill certain obligations under long term contracts to purchase natural gas from producers and transportation capacity from interstate pipeline companies see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the company s strategy focuses on recovering contractual costs and maximizing the value of contractual assets 
currently  the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
washington gas s jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the actual invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
the company believes that its regulated utility prudently entered into its gas contracts and that the costs being incurred should be recoverable from customers 
if future unbundling or other initiatives remove the current gas cost recovery provisions  the company s regulated utility could suffer adverse impacts to the extent it incurs non competitive gas costs with no other satisfactory regulatory mechanisms available to recover any costs that may exceed market prices 
the company s regulated utility currently has recovery mechanisms for such potentially stranded costs in all jurisdictions 
washington gas actively manages its supply portfolio to ensure that its sales and supply obligations remain balanced 
if washington gas were to determine that competition or changing regulation would preclude it from recovering these costs in rates  these costs would be charged to expense without any corresponding revenue recovery 
if this situation were to occur and depending upon the timing of the occurrence  the impact on the company s financial position and results of operations would likely be significant 
in the event that a regulatory body disallows the recovery of such costs  these costs would be borne by shareholders 
to minimize its exposure to contracting risks  washington gas has mechanisms in its customer choice programs to assign to participating marketers approximately percent of the storage and peak winter capacity resources that were dedicated to serving bundled service customers when those customers elected a third party marketer 
washington gas is also updating its forecasts of customer growth and the associated requirements for pipeline transportation  storage and peaking resources 
while it is not renewing expiring long term gas commodity contracts at the present time  it is generally renewing pipeline transportation and storage contracts to meet its forecasts of increased customer gas requirements  and consistent with regulatory mechanisms to provide for or make available such resources to marketers serving customers in the customer choice programs 
as the gas commodity contracts expire  washington gas enters into flexible short term purchasing arrangements to meet demand 
this strategy mitigates the exposure to long term commitments beyond minimum federal energy regulatory commission approved contracting requirements  while ensuring reliable and competitively priced gas for customers that continue to buy the natural gas commodity from the regulated utility 
to maximize the value of its contractual assets  the regulated utility has entered into contracts with unregulated marketers that make use of its firm storage and transportation rights to meet thecity gate delivery needs and to make off system sales when such storage and transportation rights are underutilized 
the regulated utility continues to pay the fixed charges associated with the firm storage and transportation contracts used to make sales 
as the local distribution company s role in the merchant function decreases over time  opportunities emerge for unregulated natural gas providers 
in the deregulated marketplace  third party marketers have profit making opportunities  but also assume the risk of loss 
recognizing the opportunities presented by competition  the company established wgeservices  an unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiary in wgeservices now markets both natural gas and electricity to residential  commercial and industrial customers both inside and outside of the washington gas service area 
to date  wgeservices has grown to nearly  natural gas customers and  electric customers 
wgeservices gross revenues in fiscal years and  which include both sales of natural gas and electricity  were million and million  respectively 
wgeservices had net income of million in fiscal year but incurred a net loss of million in fiscal year due mainly to the acquisition costs associated with deriving new electricity customers 
the company believes that customer choice programs may continue to expand customers selection of wgeservices as a service provider 
the regulatory process tends to stabilize rates and revenues of the regulated utility 
however  there can be significant volatility for unregulated third party marketers  such as wgeservices 
thus  while wgeservices has a significant potential for continued growth  it must carefully manage risks in a volatile commodity market 
wgeservices competes with other third party marketers to sell the unregulated natural gas commodity to customers 
marketers of the natural gas commodity compete largely on price and gross margins are relatively small 
furthermore  as with any startup operation  customer acquisition costs are high 
consequently  operating margins for wgeservices are lower than those earned by the regulated utility 
in addition  wgeservices faces supply side risks 
to minimize its supply side risks  wgeservices strategy is to manage its natural gas contract portfolio in a manner that closely aligns the volumes of gas it purchases with firm commitments from customers to purchase this gas and enter into transactions to moderate gas supply cost volatility 
wgeservices purchases its gas from a number of wholesale suppliers in order to avoid relying on any single provider for its natural gas supply 
additionally  wgeservices maintains gas storage inventory to meet daily and monthly fluctuations in demand caused by variations in normal weather 
similarly  wgeservices dependency on any one customer or group of customers is limited 
beginning in fiscal year  wgeservices has entered into derivative contracts in order to balance it sales commitments with the amount of gas it must purchase to satisfy those commitments 
wgeservices has a risk management policy in place and periodically reassesses its policy to determine its adequacy to mitigate risks in changing markets 
electric unbundling customer choice programs are not unique to the natural gas industry 
choice for electric customers has been implemented or will be implemented in each jurisdiction in which the regulated utility operates 
similar to the natural gas industry  participants in these programs can choose either to continue purchasing bundled electricity service from their local electric distribution utility or to purchase electricity from a third party marketer 
in anticipation of the opportunities to sell electricity in jurisdictions that have implemented customer choice programs  wgeservices entered into a master purchase and sale agreement in april with a wholesale energy marketer 
under the agreement  as wgeservices identifies profitable opportunities  it purchases electric energy  capacity and certain ancillary services from the wholesaler for resale to retail electricity customers 
in each jurisdiction that has introduced customer choice programs  wgeservices evaluates the associated profit potential and other strategic factors 
in  wgeservices significantly expanded its efforts to market electricity and enroll customers 
during fiscal year september  the company enrolled  retail electricity customers in maryland and the district of columbia 
in addition  during fiscal year wgeservices began supplying electricity to montgomery county  maryland government agencies under a million  month contract and to the washington metropolitan area transit authority metro under a million  two year contract to supply electricity to all metro facilities in the district of columbia and maryland 
wgeservices was also awarded a million contract to supply electricity to large federal facilities in the district of columbia and suburban maryland for up to three and one half years 
total electricity revenues in fiscal year were million on deliveries of billion kilowatt hours of electricity 
potential for further unbundling currently  the company s regulated utility provides customer services  such as preparing bills  reading meters and responding to customer inquiries  as part of its core utility function 
unregulated third party marketers have the option to assume responsibility for bill preparation and customer collections 
in addition to billing and collecting from customers for the natural gas commodity  third party marketers bills may include natural gas delivery charges due the regulated utility  which they subsequently remit to washington gas 
although washington gas still provides most customer services on a bundled basis  the potential exists for future deregulation initiatives to separate these services from the core utility function 
in that case  customers could choose to have unregulated competitors provide these services 
to remain competitive  the company strives to improve quality and efficiency and to reduce costs with the goal of achieving market level performance 
accordingly  the company will continue to look for opportunities to profit from further unbundling 
other factors affecting the company industry consolidation the energy industry has seen a number of consolidations  combinations  disaggregations and other strategic alliances 
these changes are being driven  in part  as energy companies seek to offer a broader range of energy services to compete more effectively in attracting and retaining customers 
for example  affiliations with other operating utilities could potentially result in economies and synergies and could provide customers with a wider range of energy services 
consolidation will present combining entities with the challenges of remaining focused on the customer and integrating different organizations 
others are discontinuing operations in certain portions of the energy industry or divesting portions of their business and facilities 
the company  from time to time  performs studies and  in some cases  holds discussions regarding utility and energy related investments and transactions with other companies 
the ultimate impact on the company of any such investments and transactions that may occur cannot be determined at this time 
regulatory matters the regulated utility bases requests for a modification to existing rates on increased investment in plant and equipment  higher operating expenses and the need to earn an adequate return on invested capital 
the regulated utility s base rates did not change in any of its jurisdictions in fiscal year and have not changed during the past six years  with the exception of a million increase in for the shenandoah division 
the following table summarizes major rate applications and results 
summary of major rate applications and results increase in annual revenues test year millions allowed return effective months on common jurisdiction date ended requested granted equity virginia maryland a district of columbia district of columbia b virginia maryland a a rates were implemented as a result of a settlement agreement 
the return on equity indicated in the order of percent was not utilized to establish rates 
b application was settled without stipulating the return on common equity 
since its last base rate proceedings in  washington gas has successfully maintained a balance between efficient management of resources and the increased costs of doing business 
to support the addition of over  new utility customers since  the regulated utility s net investment in property  plant and equipment increased percent  or million  while distribution rates remained unchanged 
throughout the same period washington gas was able to reduce the level of its operations and maintenance expenses by percent  or million  between fiscal year and fiscal year these expense savings were combined with effective deployment of capital to serve new customers 
in addition to serving a customer base that is percent larger  washington gas now operates in a more expensive environment 
during these past seven years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  rose percent 
to continue to deliver the competitive returns for shareholders and the high quality distribution service necessary to support economic growth  washington gas has determined it is necessary to file for increased rates in each of its jurisdictions 
as discussed further below under the caption district of columbia regulatory matters  washington gas requested a rate increase for gas distribution in the district of columbia in june the proposed million increase  percent of overall annual revenues in the district of columbia  includes funding to recover increased costs for construction activities required by local government 
the request also includes a percent return on equity  coupled with an incentive rate plan 
in addition to the filing made in fiscal year in the district of columbia  washington gas will likely file requests to increase utility rates in virginia and maryland during the spring of both of these filings are principally predicated on the increases in the property  plant and equipment that serve the significant customer growth in each jurisdiction 
financial results for fiscal year will likely not reflect any significant effects from these three filings 
however  washington gas believes each of these cases will be resolved close to the beginning of the winter heating season of fiscal year the results of any regulatory proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty 
the filing of rate cases is an important tool washington gas uses to ensure it maintains the proper balance between the interests of its customers and shareholders 
as washington gas has demonstrated in the past  successful management of the cases is critical to continued financial health of the regulated utility and will be a top priority of this segment in fiscal year incentive rate plan washington gas  announced on march  that it filed a notice of withdrawal with the public service commission of maryland psc of md withdrawing its may  application for authority to implement an incentive rate plan 
a new incentive rate plan proposal for the district of columbia is included in the rate case discussed below 
washington gas also anticipates including appropriate incentive rate plan proposals in the rate cases that will be filed in virginia and maryland during the spring of district of columbia regulatory matters on february   the district of columbia s office of the people s counsel opc filed a complaint with the public service commission of the district of columbia psc of dc requesting an investigation into the rates and charges of washington gas 
on february   washington gas filed an answer urging the psc of dc to dismiss the opc complaint because the opc s analysis of the regulated utility s rates was substantively flawed 
on march   the psc of dc issued an order granting the opc s request to initiate an investigation into the reasonableness of washington gas s base rates 
the psc of dc s order required washington gas to file base rate information no later than ninety days from march  the psc of dc s order did not set a schedule to issue a final order on washington gas s rates 
on june   washington gas filed an application with the psc of dc to increase rates in the district of columbia 
the request seeks to increase overall annual revenues in the district of columbia by approximately million  or percent  based on a proposed return on equity of percent 
revenues from district of columbia operations represent approximately percent of total utility revenues for washington gas 
additionally  washington gas is proposing an incentive rate plan 
the proposed incentive rate plan includes a sharing between customers and washington gas of weather normalized district of columbia regulated earnings above or below a basis point earnings band around the psc of dc s authorized return on equity 
the incentive rate plan proposes continuing the existing mechanisms for recovery of the actual cost of natural gas incurred by washington gas 
wgl holdings  inc and washington gas cannot predict the ultimate outcome of its application and the related investigation that the psc of dc has ordered 
wgl holdings  inc and washington gas expect a decision on the base rate case sometime during fiscal year environmental matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various laws related to environmental matters  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for regulatory matters as the industry continues to address competitive market issues  the cost of service regulation used to compensate the company s regulated utility for the cost of its regulated operations will continue to evolve 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services could have additional financial implications for the company 
the company s regulated utility records the results of its regulated activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 

in certain circumstances  sfas no 
allows entities whose rates are determined by third party regulators to defer costs as regulatory assets in the balance sheet to the extent that the entity expects to recover these costs in future rates 
as deregulation and competitive initiatives increasingly impact the company s regulated utility  however  sfas no 
may no longer apply to all or part of the company s regulated operations in future years 
if this occurs  the company s regulated utility operations would be subject to the same accounting standards that apply to unregulated entities 
in effect  the company s regulated utility could be required to write off certain regulatory assets that had been deferred in prior period consolidated balance sheets and charge these costs to expenses at the time it determines that the provisions of sfas no 
no longer apply 
note to the consolidated financial statements shows the composition of regulatory assets 
while the company believes that sfas no 
continues to apply to its regulated operations  the changing nature of the company s regulated utility s business requires it to assess continually the impact of those changes on its accounting policies 
weather risk on october   washington gas  announced that it purchased aweather insurance policy in order to reduce its financial exposure to warm weather during the heating season 
the policy has a five year term beginning october  the policy covers one half of the regulated utility s estimated net revenue exposure to variations in heatingdegree days hdds 
the insurance policy defines a heating degree day as the greater of i degrees fahrenheit less the average of the daily high and daily low temperatures in degrees fahrenheit as measured at washington reagan national airport  or ii zero 
for insurance policy purposes  neither average temperatures nor hdds are rounded 
income is provided in a predetermined amount for each such hdd below  per fiscal year up to a maximum of hdds  subject to certain limitations 
the annual premium under the policy is million  and the maximum expense impact in any one year is equal to the after tax effect of that premium 
if the weather in any given year is more than percent warmer than  hdds  the income provided by the policy will exceed the annual premium 
over the five year term of the policy  the regulated utility cannot be paid for more than  hdds 
additionally  if over the five year term of the policy the hdds average less than  per year  the regulated utility will receive a payment of million reduced by the effect of certain amounts previously paid on a per hdd basis as described above 
the regulated utility has performed extensive simulation analysis that indicates that the annual net cash outlay for the policy premiums paid less all benefits received should average  after income taxes over the five year period 
furthermore  the simulation analysis has demonstrated to an extremely high level of confidence that the  hdd limit is sufficient for the five year period 
actual year by year net cash outlays may vary due to policy design and actual weather conditions 
when the regulated utility reports heating degree days  it computes hdds in a method different from that used for insurance policy purposes 
the regulated utility s method rounds the average of the high and low temperatures to the nearest whole degree prior to subtracting that average from degrees 
as a result  for each fiscal year in the five year policy period  the number of hdds computed for insurance purposes will almost certainly be greater than the number of hdds reported by the regulated utility 
therefore  the insurance policy computation will indicate colder weather than the regulated utility s computation  and the annual benefit received will be lower than might be expected if the regulated utility s measure of hdds were used 
for example  based on historical analysis  the  hdd maximum mentioned above would be approximately  hdds  or percent warmer than normal  when computed using the regulated utility s method 
other income expenses net on the company s consolidated statements of income includes the policy premium for fiscal year no payments were received under the policy in fiscal year because of the weather being percent colder than normal 
under the terms of the policy  the regulated utility is able to retain all of the benefits of this colder than normal weather 
economic conditions the company and its subsidiaries operate in one of the fastest growing regions in the nation 
the continued prosperity of this region allowed the company s regulated utility to expand its regulated delivery service customer base at well over twice the national average during the past five years 
in addition  this economy provided a robust market for the company s non regulated subsidiaries to market natural gas and other energy related goods and services 
a downturn in the economy of the region in which the company operates  which cannot be predicted with accuracy  would likely adversely affect the company s ability to grow its regulated utility and other businesses at the same rate they have grown in the past 
inflation deflation from time to time  the company s regulated utility seeks approval for rate increases from regulatory commissions to help it cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investment and returns 
the most significant impact of inflation is on the company s regulated utility s replacement cost of plant and equipment 
while the regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over the company s regulated utility s retail rates allow depreciation only on the basis of historical cost to be recovered in rates  the company anticipates that its regulated utility will be allowed to recover the increased costs of its investment and earn a return thereon after replacement of the facilities occurs 
to the extent the company s regulated utility experiences a sustained deflationary economic environment  actual returns on invested capital could rise and exceed returns allowed by regulators in previous regulatory proceedings 
if this were to occur  it could prompt the initiation of a regulatory review 
market risk interest rate risk exposure related to other financial instruments at september   the regulated utility had fixed rate mtns and other long term debt aggregating million in principal amount and having a fair value of million 
fair value is defined as the present value of the debt securities future cash flows discounted at interest rates that reflect market conditions as of september  while these are fixed rate instruments and  therefore  do not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
a total of million  or approximately percent of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  have call options that enable the regulated utility to mitigate this market risk through the early redemption of those debt instruments 
likewise  a total of million  or percent of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  have put options that allow the holders of debt to mitigate market risk through the early redemption of those debt instruments 
using sensitivity analyses to measure this market risk exposure  the regulated utility estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by percent 
the company also estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates were to increase by percent 
in general  such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
price risk related to retail energy marketing operations the company s subsidiary  wgeservices  markets both natural gas and electricity 
in the course of its business  wgeservices makes fixed price sales commitments to customers and purchases the corresponding physical supplies at fixed prices to lock in margins 
wgeservices has exposure to changes in gas prices related to the volumetric differences between the purchase commitments and sales commitments 
wgeservices has managed the risk associated with gas price fluctuations by closely matching purchases from suppliers with sales commitments to customers 
historically  the responsibility for managing daily demand fluctuations from wgeservices customers resulting from variability in weather was assumed by wgl holdings regulated utility subsidiary through the use of its storage and peaking capacity 
the regulated utility charged wgeservices a fee for this service 
effective april   wgeservices assumed a major portion of the responsibility to deliver the appropriate level of gas to its customers on a daily basis 
wgeservices will continue to be able to avail itself of certain peak shaving capacity that the regulated utility provides for a fee and also is acquiring a pro rata portion of the utility s storage gas capacity to manage its load 
therefore  variations in demand caused by fluctuations in weather applicable to approximately percent of wgeservices annual sales volumes could result in wgeservices having contracted for more or less gas than its customers require on any given day 
as a result  wgeservices has modified its risk management and procurement policies to reflect the need to obtain storage capacity and other contractual arrangements to meet the weather related variability in its demand and to ensure the financial exposure caused by this variability in demand is adequately controlled 
as part of managing this exposure wgeservices purchased options after september   in accordance with its risk management policy 
the value of these options will be marked to market in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  beginning in the quarter ended december  washington gas light company as discussed on page  this annual report on form k includes separate consolidated financial statements for wgl holdings pages through  as well as for washington gas pages through 
this section discusses the financial position and results of operations of washington gas as of and for the fiscal year ended september  as previously noted  all results for washington gas prior to the november  corporate restructuring are reported on a consolidated basis  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the consolidation reflects the results of washington gas s operations  as well as those of its subsidiaries prior to the restructuring 
all results of operations reported after the restructuring reflect the financial position and results of washington gas alone 
in many cases  the reasons for the changes in the financial position and results of operations for both wgl holdings and washington gas are essentially the same 
in those instances  the reader is referred to the wgl holdings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which begins on page the following management s discussion of washington gas s financial position and results of operations only describes those instances in which the reasons for changes in the financial position or results of operations vary significantly from those of wgl holdings 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  earnings for the year ended september   washington gas reported net income applicable to common stock of million  a million improvement over the results reported for the same period last year 
washington gas results for the current year are million higher than for wgl holdings because they do not include the overall net loss generated by washington gas s former subsidiaries including the percent equity investment in primary investors after the november  corporate restructuring  as well as operating expenses incurred by the holding company subsequent to october  in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  the subsidiary earnings reported after october  were recognized in the consolidated financial statements of wgl holdings  the new parent company of washington gas s former subsidiaries 
during fiscal year  utility net revenues increased by million over the prior year 
the primary reason for the increase was a percent increase in firm therm deliveries over the prior year  which reflected an percent increase in the number of heating degree days and a percent increase in washington gas s customer base 
tempering this increase was an million increase in operation and maintenance expenses that primarily included a million increase in uncollectible accounts expense 
in addition  general taxes incurred by washington gas during the year ended september  increased due to a one time million virginia business license tax adjustment recorded as a result of a tax law restructuring that replaced some taxes with an income tax on utility operations  and the inclusion of million for a newly enacted right of way fee imposed by the district of columbia 
this fee is recovered currently from customers and has no impact on net income 
utility net revenues operating revenues and cost of gas for the fiscal year ended september   both include offsetting amounts of million for system balancing transactions with wgeservices  a subsidiary of washington gas before the november  restructuring 
these intercompany charges were eliminated on wgl holdings consolidated statements of income 
the reasons for the remaining variances in washington gas s utility net revenues are essentially identical to the utility segment net revenues that are discussed in wgl holdings management s discussion and analysis 
other utility operating expenses the other utility operating expenses reported by washington gas for the year ended september   include million of expenses for transactions with hampshire 
these intercompany charges were eliminated on wgl holdings consolidated statements of income 
the utility operating expenses reported by washington gas exclude million of other utility operating expenses incurred by hampshire subsequent to november  the reasons for the remaining variances in washington gas s other utility operating expenses are essentially identical to other utility operating expenses discussed in wgl holdings management s discussion and analysis 
non utility operating results the non utility results of operations reported by washington gas exclude the results of its former energy marketing and hvac segments after october  for a complete discussion of the results of these segments for the fiscal years ended september  and see page of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other income expenses net and interest expense the primary reasons for the changes in washington gas s other income expenses net and interest expense are essentially the same as those described in wgl holdings management s discussion and analysis 
liquidity and capital resources this section does not differ materially from the disclosure provided in the wgl holdings management s discussion and analysis 
however  washington gas s investing activities for the fiscal year ended  includes an million cash transfer related to the formation of wgl holdings and the related dividend of the former subsidiaries 
also  as noted previously in this report  in june washington gas s parent  wgl holdings  issued  shares to the public generating proceeds to the company of million 
wgl holdings infused the entire million generated from the sale to washington gas as additional contributed capital 
this additional contributed capital is being used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital requirements by washington gas
