item business micromuse develops  markets and supports a family of scalable  highly configurable  rapidly deployable software solutions that enable service and business assurance the effective monitoring of the status of multiple devices and elements underlying an information technology it service delivery infrastructure  to help provide the continuous availability of it based services and businesses 
the micromuse netcool r product suite collects  normalizes and consolidates high volumes of event information from heterogeneous network management environments into an active database that de duplicates and correlates the resulting data in real time 
it then rapidly distributes graphical views of the information to operators and administrators responsible for monitoring service levels 
netcool s unique architecture allows for the rapid  programmerless association of devices and specific attributes of those devices to the business services they impact 
this readily enables network operations teams to create and modify their service views during systems operations to monitor particular business services  rapidly identify which users are affected by which network faults  pinpoint sources of network problems  automate operator responses  facilitate problem resolution and report on the results 
we market and distribute to customers through our own sales force  oems  value added resellers and systems integrators 
we have distribution agreements with cisco systems  ericsson data services  nortel  siemens  unisphere and sun microsystems 
as of september   we had licensed our software to nearly  customers operating in and serving a variety of industries 
micromuse customers include at t  bt  cable wireless  cellular one  charles schwab  deutsche telekom  digex  earthlink  ge appliances  itc deltacom  jp morgan chase  oneone and verizon 
micromuse operates as a single operating segment  and further geographic and segment information is included in note geographic and segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
micromuse was founded in in london  england  and in reorganized as a delaware corporation and re located its headquarters to san francisco  california 
products and technology micromuse provides a suite of software products that provide realtime fault management  which enables service and business assurance 
our netcool solutions include the flagship netcool omnibus tm application  which collects  consolidates  de duplicates and correlates information from more than network management platforms and devices and presents realtime user configurable views of faults  network  service and business status 
the application allows network operations personnel to react to problems in the network infrastructure before they cause outages in service availability and or to identify outages and their probable causes 
these capabilities enable network managers to improve the reliability and functionality of their networks  thereby enhancing operating efficiencies  productivity and profitability of network operators and users 
the components of netcool omnibus are described in the section entitled netcool omnibus components 
micromuse also provides enhanced applications that work in conjunction with the netcool omnibus application 
these include the netcool service monitors tm suite  the netcool reporter tm application  the netcool impact tm application  the netcool visionary tm application  and netcool precision tm application 
the netcool service monitors suite not only manages network and system devices  but also looks at service and application availability from the customer s perspective 
it monitors the following applications and services over fixed line and wireless infrastructures ecommerce applications  email services  wireless services  service infrastructure  and bandwidth usage 
the netcool reporter tm application takes netcool omnibus data and provides historical reports on events occurring within a network infrastructure 
the netcool impact application facilitates policy based management and helps determine how netcool omnibus collected faults will impact the availability of services 
the netcool visionary application facilitates network problem diagnosis 
the netcool precision application  which includes the patented network slice tm technology  provides network inventory  network discovery and network topology functions 
in addition  the netcool suite includes a targeted series of software applications 
these proactively collect network and service status information from the following environments 
voice switches and services netcool telco service managers tm suite 
mainframe management systems netcool data center monitors tm suite 
security management netcool firewall tm application netcool omnibus components netcool omnibus is based on an open  client server architecture 
it consists of four primary components the netcool objectserver tm  which is at the heart of the architecture  netcool probes monitors tm  netcool desktops tm  and netcool gateways tm 
netcool probes monitors collect fault information from network element management systems  network devices  computing systems  applications or legacy systems 
netcool probes monitors then normalize and consolidate this data into the netcool objectserver  a high speed  memory resident database  optimized for realtime fault monitoring and building views of network status and service availability 
by manipulating the data in the netcool objectserver  netcool desktop users can design customized views of event data to monitor segments of the network or services that span the entire network 
netcool gateways permit data to be shared between multiple objectservers for load balancing or fail over facilities  exported to common relational database management systems oracle  sybase  etc 
for historical service level views  or integrated with other applications such as helpdesk applications remedy  clarify  etc netcool objectserver tm the netcool objectserver is a realtime  object oriented  memory resident  active database that stores and manages the collected network faults and service status data 
the netcool objectserver consolidates  associates and de duplicates normalized data from the netcool probes monitors  converting events  such as faults and alarms  into event objects that can be easily manipulated to create associations and filters 
the active components of the netcool objectserver include its de duplication capability and its ability to correlate event objects with other event objects  make decisions on information  automate operator responses and facilitate problem resolution 
the netcool objectserver  which has been designed and optimized for handling large volumes of events messages  can process hundreds of alarms per second and can collect data from multiple netcool probes concurrently 
the netcool objectserver architecture also permits multiple authenticated users to view all the events throughout the enterprise 
in addition  since one network fault can impact several locations in a distributed environment and can therefore trigger multiple events  the netcool objectserver is designed to automatically de duplicate repeated events so that network operators can easily identify the root cause 
the netcool objectserver architecture provides us with a competitive advantage in both the speed with which it collects network events and the ability to associate event information with the services it manages 
netcool probes monitors tm netcool probes are passive supersets of software code that collect network event data including messaged network data such as faults  alerts  and traps from elements on the network or from domain based network management systems 
these probes can collect information presented from either management platforms or devices ie hp openview  aprisma management technologies spectrum  cisco strataview plus  and newbridge and standard protocols such as screen oriented ascii character streams  application log files ie syslog tl  snmp  and most other methods of management information provision 
they recognize management information base information from switches and routers from leading vendors  including nortel  lucent  cisco  and com 
netcool probes use rules and lookup tables to categorize and add information to events 
as a result  network data collected by the netcool probes is normalized into a common alert format and then passed to the netcool objectserver 
as described in the previous section  netcool monitors provide more active  intelligent service and status monitoring 
netcool desktops the netcool desktop is an integrated suite of software tools designed for use by operators and administrators to create filters  customize views of network event data  monitor several services simultaneously  and automatically resolve service problems 
network operators can quickly build filters by responding to simple onscreen queries about user preferences 
operators can also associate events with services through the use of simple drag and drop technology that automatically creates the boolean logic and software query language required to retrieve the data from the netcool objectserver 
in this way  non programmers can manipulate the data in the netcool objectserver to custom design views of event data 
in addition  each operator can use netcool desktops to resolve element problems directly or automate responses to common network problems when critical thresholds are reached 
operators can use netcool desktops to monitor services through netcool eventlists tm  netcool eventlist dashboards summary or netcool maps 
the netcool eventlist presents a configurable spreadsheet like view of the de duplicated faults and acts as the primary interface through which operators access problem resolution tools 
the netcool eventlist dashboard summary depicts a concise view of the eventlists for several services while the netcool map provides a graphical view of the network or services that depend upon it 
administrators can use desktops to configure the netcool objectserver and the operator s netcool desktop environment 
netcool desktops run on multiple platforms  including web browsers  unix motif  and microsoft windows nt 
netcool gateways netcool gateways are interfaces to third party applications that allow sharing of netcool event data 
for example  netcool objectserver data can be exported through netcool gateways to databases such as oracle or sybase for historical analysis and reporting or to trouble ticketing packages such as remedy s trouble ticketing application 
in addition  multiple netcool objectservers can share data using a netcool gateway to offer customers load balancing and fail over facilities 
sales and marketing we market our software and services primarily through our direct sales organization with american offices in atlanta  chicago  dallas  minneapolis  new york  san francisco  and mclean  virginia  and international offices in australia  austria  brazil  china  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  the netherlands  poland  singapore  south korea  spain  taiwan  the united arab emirates  and the united kingdom  among other places 
additionally  we have a growing channel consisting of oems  value added resellers and systems integrators 
typically  the sales process will include an initial sales presentation  a product demonstration  at times a proof of concept evaluation  a closing meeting and a purchase process 
the sales process typically takes one to three months  although we have experienced longer and less predictable cycles 
companies often purchase netcool products to manage their internal data network initially and upon its demonstrated effectiveness subsequently make additional and larger purchases 
a majority of our sales are from repeat customers who generally purchase additional software as their networks expand  or as additional sites within a customer learn of the services provided by  and the benefits of  netcool 
we have a number of marketing programs designed to inform potential customers about the capabilities and benefits of our products 
our marketing efforts include investing in our technical leadership  participation in industry trade shows  technical conferences and technology seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  analyzing returns on investment in our software  sales training  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals and advertising 
although we increased the size of our sales organization during the year ended september   we experienced difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number of highly qualified and effective sales people during that period 
if we are to achieve significant revenue growth in the future  we must successfully train our existing sales force and recruit additional premier sales personnel and increase their productivity 
competition for such individuals is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to either retain and adequately train our current sales force or attract qualified sales personnel in the future 
if we are unable to hire such people and make them productive on a timely basis  our business  operating results or financial condition would be adversely affected 
see risk factors we need to continue to expand and improve the productivity of our sales force and our technical services and customer support organization 
to achieve significant growth in revenues in the future we must continue to expand and improve the performance of our network of distribution partners 
our network of distribution partners currently includes vars  systems integrators and oem partners  including cisco  ericsson data services  nortel  siemens  unisphere and sun microsystems 
these partners license our products at a discount to list price for re licensing and may provide training  support and technical and customer services to the end users of the our products 
at times  members of our technical services organization will assist a channel partner with training and technical support 
we offer a comprehensive channel partnering program consisting of training  certification  technical support  priority communications regarding upcoming activities and products  and joint sales and marketing activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain vars  systems integrators and oems or that such organizations will be able to market and sell our products effectively 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our existing or future channel partners will continue to represent our products 
see risk factors we need to continue to expand our distribution channels and retain our existing third party distributors 
in part  because we first sold our software in the united kingdom and were previously domiciled in london  sales of our software outside of the united states ie  international sales have historically comprised a significant portion of our total revenue 
international sales accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that a majority of these international sales were made to customers in the united kingdom  france and germany 
while we believe there are significant opportunities in europe  we expect international revenues from europe as a percentage of total revenues to decline in future periods as we more fully exploit opportunities in the united states and in the pacific rim 
see risk factors our international sales and operations expose us to currency fluctuation risks and other inherent risks 
technical services our technical services organization provides customers with a broad range of support services including pre sales demonstrations  evaluations  implementations  consulting services  training and ongoing technical support 
in addition  the technical services organization serves a variety of internal functions  including drafting support and training documentation  product management  product testing  research and development related to specific customer industries 
our recent growth and the expansion of the customer base of netcool have increased the demands on our technical services organization 
competition for qualified technical personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the current resources in our technical services organization will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business 
the failure to expand our technical services organization at least commensurate with the expansion in the installed base of netcool products would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see risk factors we need to continue to expand and improve the productivity of our sales force and our technical services and customer support organization and we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
customer support the customer support organization is responsible for providing ongoing technical support for our customers after implementation of the product and for training the next generation of our software engineers and technical services personnel 
based on feedback by customers  we believe that the quality and responsiveness of our customer support organization provides it with a significant competitive advantage 
for an annual maintenance fee  a customer will receive toll free telephone and email support  as well as certain new releases of our products 
we offer two support packages to our customers hours a day  days a week support or hours a day  days a week support 
while support personnel generally answer the technical support calls and resolve most problems over the phone  we will deploy one of our technical support personnel in the event that an on site visit is necessary 
as our installed base of netcool customers has grown  revenue from maintenance fees has grown 
due to more recent general economic and specific customer factors and the reliability of our products  some customers have chosen to reduce or forego their maintenance coverage 
we are implementing initiatives to counter these trends but there can be no assurance that maintenance revenue will continue at its current level or will continue its historic growth 
the failure to grow maintenance revenue would have a material adverse impact on our business results and financial condition 
research and development we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop new products that maintain technological and operational competitiveness and leadership and deliver a rapid roi to our customers 
we have historically developed and expect to continue to develop our products in conjunction with our existing and potential customers 
extensive product development input is obtained through customers  through our monitoring of end user needs and changes in the marketplace and through partnerships with leading research institutes such as cambridge university centre for communication systems research 
our research and development organization is composed of two related engineering groups 
the core technology group is responsible for the enhancement of netcool omnibus  including our real time technologies and the exploration of new directions and applications of our core objectserver  probe  gateway and desktop technologies 
the application development group is responsible for designing and developing off the shelf products that leverage the technologies developed by the core technology group 
while both groups work closely with customers  the application development group depends on customer contact and partnerships for the rapid development of new fault and service level management products 
both research and development groups work closely with our technical services organization and our marketing organization to incorporate customer feedback and market requirements into their product development agendas 
we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
our total expenses for research and development  exclusive of purchased research and development costs  for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
since we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future  product development expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
to date  our development efforts have not resulted in any capitalized software development costs 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory environments  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the introduction or announcement of products by the company or our competitors embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product features that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and features  or that our new products or product features will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
in addition  to the extent that any product upgrade or enhancement requires extensive installation and configuration  current customers may postpone or forgo the purchase of new versions of our products 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce enhancements of existing products or new products in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
see risk factors rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete and our products operate on third party software platforms  and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
in addition  software products as complex as ours may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
for example  the initial commercial release of netcool reporter had features and performance characteristics that had limited market appeal 
see risk factors if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance or our products and our reputation will be harmed  and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
competition as noted above  our products are designed for use in the evolving business and service assurance and enterprise network management markets 
competition in these markets is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  new and evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
our current and prospective competitors offer a variety of solutions to address the slm service level management and enterprise network management markets and generally fall within the following five categories i customer s internal design and development organizations that produce slm and network management applications for their particular needs  in some cases using multiple instances of products from hardware and software vendors such as sun microsystems  inc sun and hewlett packard company hp  ii vendors of network and systems management frameworks including computer associates international  inc ca and international business machines corporation ibm  iii vendors of network and systems management applications including hp  bmc software  inc  sun and ibm  iv providers of specific market applications  and v systems integrators serving the telecommunications industry which primarily provide programming services to develop customer specific applications including tcsi corporation  telcordia and agilent 
in the future  as we enter new markets  we expect that such markets will have additional  market specific competitors 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  we have become aware of new and potential entrants in portions of our market space and we expect additional competition from these and other established and emerging companies 
increased competition may result in price reductions and may result in reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
some of our existing and potential customers and distributors continuously evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or purchase them from outside vendors 
sometimes these customers internally design and develop their own software solutions for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to purchase products offered by independent vendors such as ours 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers as to the advantages of our products versus internally developed network operations support and management applications 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products or to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
existing competitors could also increase their market share by bundling products having management functionality offered by our products with their current applications 
moreover  our current and potential competitors may increase their share of the fault and service level management market by strategic alliances and or the acquisition of competing companies 
in addition  network operating system vendors could introduce new or upgrade and extend existing operating systems or environments that include management functionality offered by our products  which could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights our success and ability to compete is significantly dependent upon our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright  patent and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary technology will prevent misappropriation of such technology  and such protections may not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that we will not receive future communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
although we believe alternative software is available from other third party suppliers  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could result in delays or reductions in our product shipments until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see risk factors our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate  or a third party could claim that we are infringing its proprietary rights and we rely on software that we have licensed from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
employees as of september   we had employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  technical services  customer support and product development personnel 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
see risk factors failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our business  failure to improve our infrastructure may adversely affect our business  we need to continue to expand and improve the productivity of our sales force and our technical services and customer support organization  and we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
item properties our headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in san francisco  under a lease that expires in january our principal product development operations as well as our european headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in london pursuant to a lease that expires in april we also maintain offices in atlanta  chicago  dallas  new york  mclean  virginia  beijing  dubai  eindhoven  frankfurt  hong kong  madrid  mexico  milan  paris  sao paulo  seoul  singapore  sydney  taipei  tokyo  vienna and warsaw 
we believe that our current facilities are adequate for our needs through the next twelve months  and that  should it be needed  suitable additional space will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations on commercially reasonable terms  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
item legal proceedings the company is routinely involved in legal and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of its business

overview micromuse inc develops  markets and supports a family of scalable  highly configurable  rapidly deployable software solutions that enable fault management and service assurance 
the company was founded in in london  england  and initially operated a systems integration business  reselling computer hardware and software products and providing consulting services  principally for managing networks 
leveraging our expertise in network management  we developed our netcool omnibus software  which we began shipping in january in march  the company was reorganized in delaware and relocated its headquarters from london to san francisco 
in connection with the reorganization  we raised million through the sale of equity securities and arranged a million credit facility 
in september  we raised an additional million through the sale of equity securities and sold our systems integration business for approximately million  net of fees 
in order to further the growth of the netcool business  we completed an initial public offering ipo of common stock on february   raising approximately million  net of fees and expenses 
with the proceeds from the financings and the sale of the systems integration business  we expanded operations and substantially increased development  sales and administrative headcount for the netcool business 
on july   we completed a follow on offering of common stock  raising approximately million  net of fees and expenses 
to accommodate recent growth  to compete effectively and manage future growth  if any  we will be required to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our workforce 
all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool related revenues will continue to account for all or substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of our netcool products and enhancements thereto 
as of september   we had licensed our netcool products to nearly  customers worldwide 
we license our software through our direct sales force  oems and value added resellers 
license revenues from oems and resellers combined  which are recognized upon the shipment to the oems and value added resellers  accounted for approximately  and of our total license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant additional revenue growth in the future will depend substantially on our success in recruiting and training sufficient sales and technical services personnel  maintaining our current distribution relationships and establishing additional relationships with oems  resellers and systems integrators 
as a result of our multinational operations and sales  our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies  particularly the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
for example  while our united states headquarters is located in san francisco  california  our principal product development operations are located in london  england 
as a result  a substantial portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  license  maintenance and service revenues outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
see note geographic and segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues  except as indicated year ended september  as a percentage of total revenues revenues license maintenance and services total revenues cost of revenues license maintenance and services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative purchased in process research and development amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
executive recruiting costs total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income before income taxes income taxes net income loss as a percentage of related revenues cost of license revenues cost of maintenance and services revenues revenues our total revenues are derived from license revenues for our netcool family of products  as well as associated maintenance  consulting and training services revenues 
license revenues are recognized upon the acceptance of a purchase order and shipment of the software provided that the fee is fixed and determinable  no significant obligation remains and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
allowances for credit losses and for estimated future returns are provided for upon shipment 
credit losses and returns to date have not been material 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically months 
payments for maintenance fees on initial order or on renewal are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
revenues for consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of product licenses sold and in average transaction size  reflecting the increased acceptance of netcool omnibus  the expansion of our sales organization and the growing sales of netcool internet service monitors  netcool impact  netcool reporter  netcool precision and netcool visionary 
maintenance and services revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  as a result of providing maintenance and services to a larger installed base in each successive year 
the percentage of our total revenues attributable to software was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance and services revenues accounted for  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased as compared to the prior quarters in the fiscal year 
revenues for the fourth quarter were million as compared to million  million and in the third  second and first fiscal quarter respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the current economic slowdown that is limiting the overall capital spending of our existing and potential customers 
additionally  results for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september  we expect that results for the first quarter of fiscal will remain relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from us operations were  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues include all revenues other than those from the united states 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
to date  our revenues have resulted primarily from sales to the telecommunications industry  including isps 
license revenues from telecommunications industry customers and isps combined accounted for  and of our total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
also  one third party distributor  cisco systems  inc  accounted for approximately of revenues for the year ended september  however  no one end user customer accounted for more than of total revenue for the year ended september  no one third party distributor or end user customer accounted for more than of total revenue in fiscal and cost of revenues cost of license revenues consists primarily of technology license fees paid to third party software vendors and the costs of software media  packaging and production 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues has remained relatively consistent from year to year at in both fiscal and and in fiscal cost of maintenance and service revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs incurred in providing maintenance  consulting and training to customers 
cost of maintenance and service revenues decreased as a percentage of maintenance and service revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal  principally due to economies of scale 
these decreases were partially offset by increased personnel  facilities and travel costs associated with growth in the customer support and technical services organization 
we expect that maintenance and services costs will continue to increase in dollar amounts in future periods as we continue to hire additional customer support and technical services personnel and expand our maintenance  consulting and training activities 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by personnel engaged in sales  technical presales and marketing activities  as well as the costs of trade shows  public relations  marketing materials and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increases in both fiscal and fiscal reflected the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the building of our sales force 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
these percentage reductions were primarily due to the increased scale of operations 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in future periods in accordance with our planned growth 
research and development expenses research and development expenses  exclusive of purchased research and development costs  consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses and costs of computer systems and software development tools 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses in each year was primarily attributable to increased personnel  additional facilities and an increase in the computer systems and software development tools required by the additional personnel 
in addition to increasing our research and development facility in london  we expanded our research and development presence in new york 
research and development expenses represented of total revenues in fiscal  and we expect that our research and development costs will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we continue to enhance and extend our core technologies and product lines 
to date  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for administration  finance  information systems and human resources  as well as professional fees and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal these changes each year were primarily due to increased staffing  facilities costs and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
these percentage reductions were primarily due to the increased scale of operations 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we expand our administrative staff  add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on december   the company acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of calvin alexander networking  inc can  a privately held developer of network auto discovery technology 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock  then valued at approximately million  and we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets ofapproximately million in fiscal  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years 
we also recorded an immediate expense of million relating to in process research and development in fiscal on july   the company acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of netops corporation netops  a privately held developer of diagnostic technology 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company issued cash and approximately  shares of its common stock  then valued in aggregate at approximately million  and we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years 
we also recorded an immediate expense of million relating to in process research and development in fiscal research and development costs to bring the products from the acquired companies to technological feasibility did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or condition 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets relating to our acquisitions of can and netops aggregated and million for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the increase is due to a full year s amortization in fiscal as compared to partial year amortization in fiscal as the acquisitions occurred during the fiscal year we expect amortization of approximately million in the fiscal year ending september  relating to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on october   we will adopt the statement of financial accounting standard board sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july  will cease  and goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
as of october   approximately million of goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be tested annually for impairment 
before the issuance of sfas  the company expected to amortize on a straight line basis  approximately million  million and million of goodwill in fiscal years  and executive recruiting costs the executive recruiting costs in fiscal include a million charge related to the fair value of the warrant issued to the executive search firm to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and approximately million related to cash fees paid to the executive search firm and certain relocation costs 
other income expense other income in fiscal  and includes the interest earned from the proceeds raised from the public offerings and cash generated from operations  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
fiscal also included insurance proceeds related to the death of the former chairman and chief executive officer 
income taxes for the year ended september   our effective tax rate was 
the effective rate differs from the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to acquisition related charges that were non deductible for tax purposes and the tax impact of foreign operations 
our future effective tax rate could be affected by any future acquisition related charges that were non deductible for tax purposes  if earnings are materially different than anticipated in countries where we have lower effective tax rates or by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  up from million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of september  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal was due primarily to net income adjusted for non cash expenses  the increase in accrued expenses and deferred revenue  the increase in accounts payable  the maturity of investments and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
these sources of cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by capital expenditures  the increase in billed receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets  the purchase of investments and the repurchase of treasury stock in september the increase in accrued expense  deferred revenue  and accounts receivable reflects the growth in the business 
as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  up from million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of september  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal was due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock  the increase in accrued expenses  deferred revenue  the net maturity of investments and the net loss adjusted for non cash items 
these sources of cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by capital expenditures  the increase in billed receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets  the acquisition of can and netops  and the decrease in accounts payable and income taxes payable 
the increase in accrued expense  deferred revenue  and accounts receivable reflects the growth in the business 
as of september   the company s principal commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases 
see note commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our current cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or obtain credit facilities 
the decision to sell additional equity or debt securities could be made at any time and would likely result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies

our operating results may vary as a result of the current economic slowdown we face uncertainty in the degree to which the current economic slowdown will negatively affect growth and capital spending by our existing and potential customers 
we have recently experienced increased instances of customers delaying or deferring licenses of our software and maintenance agreement  and longer lead times needed to close our customer sales 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may not be able to accurately anticipate the magnitude of these impacts on future quarterly results 
the recent terrorist attacks are unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may harm our business and prospects and our ability in general to conduct business in the ordinary course 
terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc in september have disrupted commerce throughout the world 
the continued threat of terrorism and the resulting military  economic and political response and heightened security measures may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that this disruption results in a general decrease in our customers spending  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
following the attack  one of our new york offices was closed for a number of weeks causing some delays in our product development effort and business travel was seriously disrupted 
we also may experience delays in receiving payments from customers that have been affected by the attacks  which  in turn  would harm our cash flow 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long term adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
these and other developments arising out of the attacks may make the occurrence of one or more of the factors discussed under risk factors more likely to occur 
because we have a limited operating history in a dynamic market  it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
because we have a relatively limited operating history in a rapidly evolving and dynamic market  it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
we first shipped our netcool omnibus product in january of and therefore have a limited operating history of developing and providing service level management software 
our limited operating history and rapidly changing product development  installation  maintenance and market dynamics make the prediction of future results of operations difficult 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  costs and difficulties frequently encountered by emerging companies  particularly companies in the competitive software industry 
we intend to increase our operating expenses to hire experienced senior managers  develop new distribution channels  increase our sales and marketing efforts  implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  broaden technical services and customer support capabilities  fund higher levels of research and development and expand administrative resources in anticipation of future growth 
our operating results will be harmed if these increased expenditures do not result in increased revenues and profitability 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly revenues and operating results in geographic segments that we track fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
it is possible that in some quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to our business or financial markets generally  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we realize a significant portion of our license revenues in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are difficult to forecast because it is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
moreover  our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of software  varies substantially from customer to customer 
further  we base our expense levels in part on forecasts of future orders and sales  which are extremely difficult to predict 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel  facilities  and sales and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  our operating results will be harmed if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter 
in addition  the number and timing of large individual sales has been difficult for us to predict  and large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
the loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results 
because of these fluctuations we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of our future performance 
a number of other factors are likely to cause these variations  including 
changes in the demand for our software products and services and the level of product and price competition that we encounter  
the timing of new hires and our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including changes in our sales incentives  
the mix of products and services sold  including the mix of sales to new and existing customers and through third party distributors and our direct sales force  
changes in the mix of  and lack of demand from  distribution channels through which our products are sold  
the length of our sales cycles and the success of our new customer generation activities  
spending patterns and budgetary resources of our customers on network management software solutions  
product life cycles and the timing of introductions or enhancements of products  or delays in the introductions or enhancements of our products and those of our competitors  
market acceptance of new products  
changes in the renewal rate of maintenance agreements  
expansion of international operations  including gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations and the mix of international and domestic revenue  
the extent of market consolidation  and 
software defects and other product quality problems 
failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our business 
we have grown rapidly  adding customers  personnel and expanding the scope and geographic area of our operations 
our growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for our management personnel and has placed and will continue to place a significant strain upon our management and our operating and financial systems and resources 
we have grown from employees on september  to employees on september  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the number of employees declined due to planned reductions and attrition 
given the uncertainties discussed in this risk factors section  together with factors that might affect our ability to quickly expand or contract our work force around the world  it is difficult to predict future requirements for the number and type of employees in the fields and geographies in which we operate 
failure to align employee skills and populations with revenue and market requirements would have a material adverse impact on our business and its operating results 
failure to improve our infrastructure may adversely affect our business 
we need to continue to implement and improve a variety of operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls 
in particular  we need to improve our accounting and financial reporting systems  which currently require substantial management effort  and to successfully manage an increasing number of relationships with customers  suppliers and employees 
these demands require the addition of new management personnel  and we are currently in the process of recruiting individuals to fill important management positions 
further  we need to continue to develop a global financial and accounting system 
our business will be harmed if we are unable to recruit and retain these key personnel  if our current and future executive officers do not operate effectively  both independently and as a group  or if we fail to implement improved operational  financial and management systems 
we need to continue to expand and improve the productivity of our sales force and our technical services and customer support organization 
our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled sales and technical personnel 
in spite of the economic slowdown  competition for these personnel is intense 
sales personnel are in high demand and are difficult to attract and retain and require nine months  or longer  to become fully productive 
further  because of the recent expansion of the installed base of our products  the demands on our technical services and customer support resources have grown rapidly 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly sales and technical personnel  could make it difficult to meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
we need to continue to expand our distribution channels and retain our existing third party distributors 
we need to continue to develop relationships with leading network equipment and telecommunications providers and to expand our third party channels of distribution through oems  resellers and systems integrators 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these relationships and channels of distribution  which could reduce our ability to generate profits 
third party distributors accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our business will be harmed if we are not able to attract additional distributors that market our products effectively 
further  many of our agreements with third party distributors are nonexclusive  and many of the companies with which we have agreements also have similar agreements with our competitors or potential competitors 
our third party distributors have significantly greater sales and marketing resources than we do  and their sales and marketing efforts may conflict with our direct sales efforts 
in addition  although sales through third party distributors result in reduced sales and marketing expense with respect to such sales  we sell our products to third party distributors at reduced prices  resulting in lower gross margins on such third party sales 
we believe that our success in penetrating markets for our fault and service level management applications depends substantially on our ability to maintain our current distribution relationships  in particular  those with cisco systems  ericsson  unisphere siemens  sun microsystems and others 
our business will be harmed if network equipment and telecommunications providers and distributors discontinue their relationships with us  compete directly with us or form additional competing arrangements with our competitors 
we are dependent on the market for software designed for use with advanced communications services  and the size of this market is unproven 
the market for our products is in an early stage of development and is very dynamic 
although the rapid expansion and increasing complexity of computer networks in recent years and the resulting emergence of service level agreements has increased the demand for fault and service level management software products  the awareness of and the need for such products is a recent development 
because the market for these products is only beginning to develop  it is difficult to assess the size of this market  the appropriate features and prices for products to address this market  the optimal distribution strategy and the competitive environment that will develop 
we are substantially dependent upon telecommunications carriers and other service providers continuing to purchase our products 
telecommunications carriers  including internet service providers  that deliver advanced communications services to their customers have accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  these providers are the central focus of our sales strategy 
if these customers cease to deploy advanced communications services for any reason  the market for our products will be harmed 
also  delays in the introduction of advanced services  such as network management outsourcing  or the failure of such services to gain widespread market acceptance or the decision of telecommunications carriers and other service providers not to use our products in the deployment of these services would harm our business 
consolidations in  or a slowdown in the growth of  the telecommunications industry could harm our business 
we have derived a substantial amount of our revenues from sales of products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry has experienced significant growth and consolidation in the past few years  although recent trends indicate that this growth and capital spending by this industry has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future as a result of a general decline in economic growth in local and international markets 
our business is highly dependent on the growth of the telecommunications industry and on continued capital spending by our customers in that industry 
in the event of a continued of further significant slowdown in the growth or capital spending of the telecommunications industry  our business would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as a result of industry consolidation  there may be fewer potential customers requiring our software in the future 
larger  consolidated telecommunications companies may also use their purchasing power to create pressure on the prices and the margins we could realize 
we cannot be certain that consolidations in  or a slowdown in the growth of  the telecommunication industry will not harm our business 
our business depends on the continued growth of the internet 
a significant portion of our revenues comes from telecommunications carriers  internet service providers and other customers that rely upon or are driven by the internet 
as a result  our future results of operations substantially depend on the continued acceptance and use of the internet as a medium for commerce and communication 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet and online services is a recent phenomenon 
our business could be harmed if this rapid growth does not continue or if the rate of technological innovation  deployment or use of the internet slows or declines 
recent data and reports indicate that both the growth of significant portions of the internet and technological innovations have slowed 
if these trends continue  they will likely have an adverse impact on our business 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for internet based services may prompt the introduction of new laws and regulations 
laws  which impose additional burdens on those companies that conduct business online  could decrease the expansion of the use of the internet 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise harm our business 
we face intense competition  including from larger competitors with greater resources than our own  which could result in our losing market share or experiencing a decline in gross margins 
we face intense competition in our markets 
as we enter new markets  we encounter additional  market specific competitors 
in addition  because the software market has relatively low barriers to entry  we are aware of new and potential entrants in portions of our market space 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions and may result in reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
further  many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products or to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
existing competitors could also increase their market share by bundling products having functionality offered by our products with their current applications 
moreover  our current and potential competitors may increase their share of the fault and service level management market by strategic alliances and or the acquisition of competing companies 
in addition  network operating system vendors could introduce new or upgrade and extend existing operating systems or environments that include functionality offered by our products  which could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
our current and prospective competitors offer a variety of solutions to address the fault and service level and enterprise network management markets and generally fall within the following five categories 
customer s internal design and development organizations that produce service level management and network management applications for their particular needs  in some cases using multiple instances of products from hardware and software vendors such as compaq  hewlett packard company and cabletron systems  inc  
vendors of network and systems management frameworks including computer associates international  inc and international business machines corporation  
vendors of network and systems management applications including hewlett packard company  bmc software  inc  and international business machines corporation  
providers of specific market applications  and 
systems integrators serving the telecommunications industry which primarily provide programming services to develop customer specific applications including tcsi corporation and agilent technologies  inc with its acquisition of objective systems integrators  inc many of our existing and potential customers and distributors continuously evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or purchase them from outside vendors 
sometimes these customers internally design and develop their own software solutions for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to purchase products offered by independent vendors such as ours 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers as to the advantages of our products versus internally developed network operations support and management applications 
if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance of our products and our reputation will be harmed  and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
complex software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
despite our extensive product testing  we have in the past released versions of netcool omnibus with defects and have discovered software errors in certain of our products after their introduction 
for example  version of netcool omnibus  released in  had a number of material defects 
version of netcool reporter  released in  had features and performance characteristics that limited market acceptance 
a significant portion of our technical personnel resources were required to address these defects 
because of these defects  we could continue to experience delays in or failure of market acceptance of products  or damage to our reputation or relationships with our customers 
any defects and errors in new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments would harm our business 
in addition  because our products are used to monitor and address network problems and avoid failures of the network to support critical business functions  any design defects  software errors  misuse of our products  incorrect data from network elements or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek to have us pay for these losses 
although we maintain product liability insurance  it may not be adequate 
further  although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims as well as any liabilities arising from such claims  such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims and the liability and costs associated therewith 
the sales cycle for our software products is long  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could cause our operating results to fall below our expectations 
the sales cycle is highly customer specific and can vary from a few weeks to many months 
the software requirements of customers is highly dependent on many factors  including but not limited to their projections of business growth  capital budgets and anticipated cost savings from implementation of our software 
our delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could harm our operating results 
our software is generally used for division wide or enterprise wide  business critical purposes and involves significant capital commitments by customers 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and requires us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of our solutions 
licensing of our software products often requires an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to license such software generally involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including actions by competitors and other factors over which we have little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
our success is substantially dependent upon a limited number of key management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of such key employees could harm our business 
we do not generally have employment contracts with key personnel 
in addition  we are dependent upon our continuing ability to attract  train and retain additional highly qualified management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
also  the volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees  who often expect to realize value from stock options 
because we face intense competition in our recruiting activities  we may be unable to attract and or retain qualified personnel 
we have acquired other businesses and we may make additional acquisitions in the future  which will complicate our management tasks and could result in substantial expenditures 
we have acquired other businesses and we may make additional acquisitions in the future  which will complicate our management tasks and could result in substantial expenditures 
for example  on december  we completed the acquisition of calvin alexander networking  inc  a developer of network auto discovery software 
on july   the company completed the acquisition of netops corporation  a developer of network diagnostic software 
because of these acquisitions  we are integrating distinct products  customers and corporate cultures into our own 
these past and potential future acquisitions create numerous risks for us  including 
failure to successfully assimilate acquired operations and products  
diversion of our management s attention from other matters  
loss of key employees of acquired companies  
substantial transaction costs  
substantial liabilities or exposures in the acquired entity that were not known or accurately evaluated or forecast by us  and 
substantial additional costs charged to operations as a result of the failure to consummate a potential acquisition 
further  some of the products we acquire would require significant additional development before they can be marketed and may not generate revenue at levels we anticipate 
moreover  our future acquisitions  if any  may result in issuances of our equity securities which dilute our stockholders  the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in amortization expense 
it is possible that our efforts to consummate or integrate acquisitions will not be successful  which would harm our business 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on a limited number of products for a significant portion of our revenues 
all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool omnibus related revenues will continue to account for a substantial percentage of our revenues beyond fiscal and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
although we have netcool omnibus for voice networks  netcool precision  netcool visionary and other products  our future operating results  particularly in the near term  are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of netcool omnibus  improvements to netcool omnibus and new and enhanced netcool omnibus applications 
our business will be harmed if netcool omnibus does not continue to achieve market acceptance or if we fail to develop and market improvements to netcool omnibus or new or enhanced products 
the life cycles of netcool omnibus  including the netcool omnibus applications  are difficult to estimate due in large part to the recent emergence of many of our markets  the effect of future product enhancements and competition 
a decline in the demand for netcool omnibus as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would harm our business 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period from a limited number of customers 
see concentration of credit risk in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers in the future 
if a significant customer  or group of customers  cancels or delays orders for our products  or does not continue to purchase our products at or above historical levels  our business will be harmed 
for example  pre existing customers may be part of  or become part of  large organizations that standardize using a competitive product 
the terms of our agreements with our customers typically contain a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of maintenance fees 
the maintenance agreement is renewable annually at the option of the customer and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  we generally do not have long term customer contracts upon which we can rely for future revenues 
our international sales and operations expose us to currency fluctuation risks and other inherent risks 
we license our products in foreign countries 
in addition  we maintain a significant portion of our operations  including the bulk of our software development operations  in the united kingdom 
fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the united states dollar have adversely impacted our results in the past and may do so in the future 
see note geographic and segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning revenues outside the united states 
we expect that international license  maintenance and consulting revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies and do not currently engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
our international operations and revenues involve a number of other inherent risks  including 
longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  
difficulty in staffing and generally higher costs associated with managing foreign operations  
an even lengthier sales cycle than with domestic customers  
the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  
sales in europe and certain other parts of the world generally are adversely affected in the quarter ending september  as many customers reduce their business activities during the summer months 
if our international sales become a greater component of total revenue  these seasonal factors may have a more pronounced effect on our operating results  
changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecommunications service providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and tariffs and other trade barriers  
changes in or failure to be aware of or to account for payroll  stock option  employee stock purchase and business related taxation  
political  economic or terrorism induced instability  
lack of acceptance of non localized products  
legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business  and 
immigration regulations that limit our ability to deploy our employees 
we intend to enter into additional international markets and to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states by expanding our direct sales force and pursuing additional strategic relationships 
such expansion will require significant management attention and expenditure of significant financial resources and could adversely affect our ability to generate profits 
if we are unable to establish additional foreign operations in a timely manner  our growth in international sales will be limited  and our business could be harmed 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate and we must constantly develop  market and sell new and enhanced products 
if we fail to do so  our business will be harmed 
for example  the widespread adoption of new architecture standards for managing telecommunications networks for example tmn architecture would force us to adapt our products to such standard  which we may be unable to do on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  to the extent that any product upgrade or enhancement requires extensive installation and configuration  current customers may postpone or forgo the purchase of new versions of our products 
further  the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by us or one or more of our competitors may cause our customers to defer licensing of our existing products 
our products operate on third party software platforms  and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
our products operate on third party software platforms and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
our products are designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms employed by our customers in their networks 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms and database technology 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by systems vendors  particularly sun microsystems  inc  international business machines corporation  hewlett packard company  cabletron systems  inc and cisco systems  inc and by vendors of relational database software  particularly oracle corporation and sybase  inc  could harm our business 
for example  we are modifying certain of our products to operate with the linux operating system 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate  or a third party could claim that we are infringing its proprietary rights 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  patents  trademarks or other proprietary information or intellectual property  our business could be harmed 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states  so as our international operations expand  the risk that we will fail to adequately protect our intellectual property increases 
further  while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  other parties may assert that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights or we have not fulfilled the terms of agreements with them 
any such claims  with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty  licensing or other agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we rely on software that we have licensed from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
we could lose the right to use this software or it could be made available to us only on commercially unreasonable terms 
although we believe that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers or internal developments  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by us until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would harm our business 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price may vary in response to many factors  some of which are outside our control  including 
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  
announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  
developments with respect to intellectual property rights  
adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  and 
general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stock of technology companies 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources that could harm our business 
general economic and market conditions may impair our business 
segments of the software industry have experienced significant economic downturns characterized by decreased product demand  price erosion  work slowdowns and layoffs 
our operations may in the future experience substantial fluctuations as a consequence of general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers and other factors affecting capital spending 
although we have a diverse client base  we target certain market segments 
therefore  any economic downturns in general or in the targeted segments in particular would harm our business 
our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired 
due to rapidly changing market conditions  our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired such that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable  and we may be required to record an impairment charge impacting our financial position 
as of september   we had approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which were primarily related to the acquisitions of can in december and netops in july the company regularly performs reviews to determine if the carrying value of assets is impaired 
the purpose for the review is to identify any facts or circumstances  either internal or external  which indicate that the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered 
no such impairment has been indicated to date 
however  if for example the demand for the products and services underlying this goodwill decreases as a result of the general economic slowdown or other causes and  as a result  the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from the acquired businesses are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated lives  we will record an impairment of our goodwill and recognize asset impairment charges in the quarter in which that impairment is determined 
asset impairment charges of this nature could be large and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and reported results of operations 
future sales of our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock 
as of september   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  excluding approximately million shares subject to options outstanding as of such date under our stock option plans that are exercisable at prices ranging from approximately to per share 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options  or the perception such sales could occur  may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for common stock 
in addition  tax charges resulting from the exercise of stock options could adversely affect the reported results of operations 
we have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law could delay or make difficult a change in control of micromuse that a stockholder may consider favorable 
the provisions include 
blank check preferred stock that could be used by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  and 
a classified board of directors with staggered  two year  terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of the board of directors in addition  section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware  which is applicable to us  and our stock incentive plans  may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of micromuse 
year issues could impair our business 
we have designed and tested our products to be year compliant 
we continue to believe that our products performed well during the roll over from to and february  however  any undetected or unreported errors or defects associated with year date functions could result in material costs to us 
in addition  certain components of our products process timestamp information from third party applications or local operating systems 
if such third party applications or local operating systems are not year compliant  our products that process such timestamp information may not be year compliant 
in our standard license agreements  we provide certain warranties to licensees that our software routines and programs are year compliant 
if any of our licensees experience year problems  such licensees could assert claims for damages against us 
any such claims or litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if ultimately decided in our favor 
based on work done to date and our best estimates  we have not incurred material costs and do not expect to incur future material costs in addressing the year issue in our systems and products 
euro conversion may adversely affect our business 
on january   various european countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and a new single currency known as the euro to be introduced through a transition period ending in issues we are reviewing as a result of the euro include updating information technology systems  assessing currency risk  reviewing licensing agreements and contracts for currency issues  and processing tax and accounting records 
although we do not currently expect the euro to have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions or results of operations  we cannot assure that issues relating to the euro will not harm our business 
power blackouts and rising energy costs in california could disrupt our business and increase our expenses 
our principal executive offices are located in san francisco  california 
our principal product development operations are located in london  and we have other offices in more than cities outside california 
in fiscal  california experienced rolling blackouts of electricity and rising energy costs throughout the state 
we have not experienced any material power disruptions or material energy expense increases to date 
however  a continuation or worsening of these adverse energy circumstances may disrupt our ability to market our products or provide services to customers or otherwise adversely affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenues and operating expenses in the uk however  as of september   no hedging contracts were outstanding 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in the uk instead  we believe that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenues will substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
fixed income investments our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with less than three months to maturity are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three months or less are considered cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments  investments with maturities in excess of twelve months are considered to be long term investments 
the weighted average pre tax interest rate on the investment portfolio is approximately
