analysis of interest rate sensitivity the following discussion of interest rate sensitivity contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
the table below sets forth  as of december   the distribution of repricing opportunities of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
the table sets forth the time periods during which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contracted terms 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees and at different times to changes in market interest rates 
also  loan prepayments and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit could cause the interest sensitivities to vary from those which appear in the table 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would generally tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive gap would generally tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of declining interest rates  a negative gap would generally tend to result in increased net interest income  while a positive gap would generally tend to affect adversely net interest income 
the company s future earnings may be adversely affected by a sharp upturn in interest rates as the company is liability sensitive for a period extending through five years 
in a falling rate environment  earnings might benefit to a certain degree from this position  because assets at higher rate levels would reprice downward at a slower rate than interest sensitive liabilities 
in prior years  the company has used its securities available for sale as a primary means to counter movements in interest rates 
at december   this portfolio contained a substantial amount of longer term securities with call features 
due to overall increases in interest rate levels these securities have not been called as originally anticipated 
the rising interest rate levels also resulted in a substantial increase in net unrealized losses making the sale of these securities impractical 
at present and for an indeterminate amount of time in the future  the company will not be able to use the securities available for sale portfolio to respond to interest rate movements to the extent possible in recent years 
this risk can be mitigated  however  by funds management  specifically through use of credit instruments offered by the federal home loan bank 
accordingly  the company s vulnerability to upward movements of interest rates has increased 
an interest sensitivity table showing all major interest sensitive asset and liability categories for the time intervals indicated and cumulative gaps for each interval is set forth on the following table 
interest rate december  sensitivity table interest sensitive days in thousands years years total interest earning assets commercial and industrial loans       real estate mortgage loans       real estate construction loans    loans to individuals       total loans  net of unearned income       federal funds sold   interest bearing deposits   securities available for sale       securities held to maturity       mortgage loans held for sale total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits   savings deposits   time deposits      other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities      cumulative ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities 



cumulative interest sensitivity gap       the company is sensitive to interest rate changes  as liabilities generally reprice or mature before interest earning assets 
the above gap table reflects the company s rate sensitive position at december   and is not necessarily reflective of its position throughout the year 
the carrying amounts of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they reprice to market rates or mature and are summed to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
excludes nonaccrual loans 
each category is shown net of unearned income and deferred fees 
call features on certain securities  if exercised  could have the effect of materially shortening the average life of the investment portfolio 
the exercise of a call feature is dependent upon the rate environment 
the call decision is at the issuers discretion and ultimate benefit 
available for sale securities and scheduled using amortized cost
