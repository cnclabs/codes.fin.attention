item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial information of bionova holding and the financial statements and related notes of bionova holding included elsewhere in this form k 
overview for operating and financial reporting purposes  the company historically has classified its business into three fundamental areas farming  which consists principally of interests in company owned fresh produce production facilities and joint ventures or contract growing arrangements with other growers  distribution  consisting principally of interests in sales and distribution companies in mexico  the united states  and canada  and research and development or technology  consisting of business units focused on the development of fruits and vegetables and intellectual properties associated with these development efforts 
if the sale of the fresh produce business is approved  the company will sell the subsidiaries engaged in the farming and distribution businesses and will retain only the research and development business 
therefore  the farming and distribution segments have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
the company s sole business segment now consists of its research and development business 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues of research and development declined from million in to million in the revenue decline was attributable to the termination of i certain research contracts and ii extra revenue payments received from savia in to cover prior year obligations under savia s long term funded research agreement with dna plant technology 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million from to due to higher legal expenses associated with shareholder litigation and expenses incurred to begin the business and financial restructuring of the company 
research and development expenses decreased by million from to due to a reduction in supervisory personnel 
interest expense increased from million in to million in this million increase was due to a higher overall level of debt outstanding and the higher interest rates in the first quarter of associated with the senior guaranteed floating rate notes issued on march  as compared with the first quarter of interest income declined from million in to million in this decline was due to lower average balances maintained in the interest reserve account associated with the floating rate notes after these notes were retired in april the decline in the losses associated with the discontinued operations of the fresh produce business from million in to million in was due to the termination of joint ventures in the farming business and production contracts awarded by bionova produce  inc which caused large write offs in an extraordinary loss of million was recorded in the second quarter of to recognize the write off of the remaining balance of up front fees paid for the floating rate note facility that was retired on april  for the year  the company expects revenues will decline from the level due to the termination of research contracts with unaffiliated parties and a renegotiation of the seminis research contract  which is expected to be at a lower level of activity 
research and development and direct administrative expenses associated with these projects will be reduced accordingly 
the overall impact on operating results of this reduced level of funded project work will be unfavorable  as the reduction in expenses will not be sufficient to offset the fixed overhead that has been allocated to these projects  such as the rental and maintenance expenses on the facilities and general administrative overheads 
management has been  and is continuing to adjust its research and development and administrative resources and expense base to refocus resources on the new trait genomics platform 
the company will not bear any interest expense in due to the cash support agreement between bionova holding and savia  under which all funding provided by savia in will be capitalized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decline in revenues was due to lower third party licensing and contract revenues  offset in part by additional contract revenues stemming from the long term funded research agreement with savia signed at the time of the merger in savia was obligated to fund dnap at least million over the three year period that ended on september   and savia paid an incremental million in to meet this obligation 
administrative expenses increased from million in to million in due to higher legal costs incurred in connection with the company s defense against shareholder suits and other general corporate expenses 
the non cash charge for amortization of goodwill  patents and trademarks increased by million in as compared with due to the recognition of a complete year of patents and trademarks amortization related to vpp s acquisition of monsanto company s strawberry assets 
interest expense associated with the continuing operations of the business as reflected in this year s financial statements shows a million increase from million in to million in the primary reason for the magnitude of this change emanated from the issuance of the company s senior guaranteed floating rate notes issued on march  prior to this time the majority of the company s consolidated debt was held in the fresh produce subsidiary companies 
this debt was consolidated at the bionova holding corporate level when the floating rate notes were issued 
in  interest expense for the fresh produce companies was million 
therefore  the real change in interest expense between and was million 
this real higher level of interest expense in was due to a higher overall level of debt outstanding and the higher interest rates associated with the floating rate notes as compared with the rates the company experienced in interest income increased from million in to million in this increase was due to higher balances resulting from the interest reserve account established in conjunction with the floating rate notes after these notes were issued in march the increase in the losses associated with the discontinued operations of the fresh produce business from to was due to the termination of joint ventures in the farming business and production contracts awarded by bionova produce  inc which caused large write offs in expected effect of discontinued operations in as savia has agreed to assume all obligations of the fresh produce business upon the sale  the company does not believe there are any material risks of these discontinued operations on the liquidity or the financial condition of the company 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our statements of operations for each of the four quarters ended december  and each of the four quarters ended december  this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k

sales     gross profit     net loss         net loss per share capital expenditures during  the company made capital investments of million 
nearly two thirds of these expenditures were directed towards the trait genomics platform to purchase gene chip  sequencing  and information processing technology 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company used million of cash in operating activities 
the net loss for the company of million was offset in part by i add backs of non cash items of which the two most significant were million of amortization and million associated with the interest on the advances from savia and bionova international  inc that were subsequently reversed with the capitalization on december  and ii million attributable to the decline in the net assets of the fresh produce business in other than a million payment made to monsanto company in the third quarter of for certain intellectual property rights associated with strawberry assets acquired by vpp in december  cash flows from investing activities and financing activities were attributable to i the retirement of the company s floating rate notes in april  ii the capitalization that was completed on december   and iii the agreement by bionova holding to sell its fresh produce business to savia 
the first of these events transpired on april  when the company retired all of the million of senior guaranteed floating rate notes then outstanding 
financing for the early retirement of these notes was provided by savia 
savia agreed to provide this million of financing on terms no less favorable than the terms of the floating rate notes 
savia also agreed that bionova holding could defer all interest payments until the final maturity date of march   and that bionova holding would not be required to maintain any funds in an interest reserve account 
the elimination of the interest reserve account freed up million in restricted cash 
on december  bionova holding entered into a purchase agreement with savia 
bionova international  inc  which is both a wholly owned subsidiary of savia and the direct parent of bionova holding  also is a party to this agreement 
the purchase agreement provides that bionova holding will sell its fresh produce farming and distribution business including all of the debt and liabilities of the fresh produce business to savia for million 
in acquiring the fresh produce business savia will purchase of the shares held by bionova holding in absa and iphc 
the purchase price for the fresh produce business will be paid by the application of million of advances previously made by savia to bionova holding 
this transaction is expected to close during the summer of a second transaction stemming from the purchase agreement  which was completed on december   was the issuance of shares of bionova holding convertible preferred stock to bionova international for million  which was paid through the application of all of the remaining outstanding advances previously made by savia to bionova holding other than the million which will be applied to the sale of the fresh produce business 
the shares of preferred stock are convertible into  shares of common stock a conversion ratio based on per share at any time after adoption and filing by the company of a charter amendment increasing the authorized number of shares of common stock to at least  these transactions were and are being undertaken by bionova holding so the company could i concentrate on its technology business and ii disengage itself from the fresh produce business  which has experienced large losses over the past several years and whose future earnings or losses are expected to continue to be exposed to sharp volatility due to the commodity nature of this business 
also  by completing these transactions the company will eliminate million of advances due to savia in along with the debt obligations of the fresh produce business 
also  by completing these transactions the company will eliminate million of advances due to savia in march  an obligation the company believed it probably would not be able to meet 
in addition  the company will be freed of all debt obligations associated with the fresh produce business 
when the sale of the fresh produce business is completed  and in conjunction with the cash support agreement described below  the company will have no outstanding related party advances or third party debt 
for accounting purposes  the sale of the fresh produce business and the sale of the series a convertible preferred stock were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control 
no gain or loss is recognized on the transactions as any differences between cash received and assets transferred to the parent are treated as capital contributions or distributions 
accordingly  the company accounted for the million in cash received in the form of advances retired from savia and its subsidiary  bionova international  inc as follows the sale of the fresh produce business was accounted for at historical cost  and million of the proceeds have been included as advances towards the sale of discontinued operations on the balance sheet 
the sale of series a convertible preferred stock was recorded at million  which represents the market value of the common stock on december   the date of the transaction  into which the series a convertible preferred shares may be converted 
the remaining million was accounted for as an additional capital contribution 
in addition  the company accrued interest expense totaling million related to the advances from savia and its subsidiary  bionova international  inc  from april through december  as a result of these transactions  the interest is not payable and the reversal of accrued interest was accounted for as an additional capital contribution 
concurrent with the sale of the fresh produce business  the company reviewed the remaining goodwill  patents and trademarks for possible impairment 
the company reviewed cash flow projections related to the intangible assets 
based on the company s analysis  the company believes that such goodwill  patents and trademarks are fully recoverable provided the company remains a going concern 
bionova holding and savia also entered into a cash support agreement for this agreement provides that  during  savia will advance funds to bionova holding as requested to finance bionova holding s technology business 
these advances will be applied ie  exchanged for to the purchase by savia of additional common shares when the sale of the fresh produce business is closed  and thereafter  through december  the purchase price to be paid by savia for the additional shares under this cash support agreement will be per share prior to the expiration of the rights offering  and then will be the higher of per share or the average market price of bionova holding common stock 
bionova holding currently has budgeted cash requirements for the calendar year in a range of to million 
the cash support agreement also acknowledges that if additional funds are required by bionova holding s fresh produce business prior to completion of the sale  savia will be responsible for providing or arranging the financing 
as a result of the company s operating losses during the past three years and management s anticipation that the company will incur a net loss and an operating cash flow deficiency for the year ending december   there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management has been and is continuing to address the company s financial condition by selling assets  exiting the fresh produce business  and by entering into the cash support agreement with savia 
there can be no assurance that these actions will result in sufficient working capital to significantly improve the company s current financial position or its results of operations 
the company also is dependent on savia to meet its commitments under the cash support agreement  which is in doubt due to recent declines in savia s financial position and the significant debt obligations it must service 
while the company is actively seeking to develop alternative sources of funding  there can be no assurance the company will be able to meet its obligations in nor secure funds beyond the calendar year 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  including without limitation statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including statements regarding our financial position  business strategy  prospects  plans and objectives of our management for future operations  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give you no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following risk factors  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause these results during and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
when we use the terms bionova  we  us  and our  these terms refer to the company and its subsidiaries 
if we do not complete the sale of the fresh produce business  we may not be able to find the financing to operate our business or to meet our financial obligations in and if this transaction is not completed  the company probably will not have enough money to pay the million it will owe to savia on march  this obligation would be satisfied as part of the sale of the fresh produce business 
the company may also have difficulty meeting debt obligations to banks or other sources of financing it establishes 
while bionova international  inc bii has agreed to vote its shares in favor of the transaction to sell the company s fresh produce business to savia  any disruptions which would cause bii to withhold its vote or vote no to this transaction or any failure to achieve other approvals  such as those required of certain regulatory authorities in the united states and mexico  could result in a failure to complete this transaction 
if the transaction is not completed  then the company s debt and or other financial obligations will continue to increase due to the funding that savia is required to provide during for operations and accruing interest expense on these advances 
it is highly unlikely the company will be able to generate the necessary funds to pay these advances debt when they become due in the company is likely to be constrained in efforts it is pursuing to develop partnerships or other types of collaboration arrangements in its technology business and in raising new capital required to carry on the technology business after with the high level of debt it will be carrying 
even if we do complete the sale of the fresh produce business  we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to implement our business plan the company has sustained losses in  and while most of these losses arose in the fresh produce business  the company s technology business also lost money in each of those years 
moreover  we do not expect the technology business to become profitable for at least three years  and it may never become profitable 
therefore  the company will need additional financing to achieve its growth and technology objectives and to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and the purchase and development of new technologies 
for  savia has agreed to provide financing to the company in exchange for stock  but savia may not have the resources to fulfill this commitment 
for and later  the company will need to find additional debt or equity financing  which may not be available 
furthermore  additional financing may dilute or otherwise adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders  cause the company to relinquish rights to its technologies or cause it to grant licenses on unfavorable terms 
we may not be able to form the strategic alliances necessary to implement our business plan development and commercialization of the company s technologies depends on customer relationships and strategic alliances with other companies 
if the company cannot find customers or strategic partners in the future  or if the company cannot maintain existing strategic alliances  the company may not be able to develop its technologies or products 
if the company does not develop commercially successful products  its business may be significantly harmed 
since the company s technologies have many potential applications and it has limited resources  our focus on any particular area may result in a failure to capitalize on more profitable areas 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain the intellectual property rights necessary to implement our business plan for our business plan to succeed  we will need to develop new technology and to acquire rights to technology owned by third parties 
we may not be able to negotiate agreements to use all of the technology we will need  leaving us unable to grow the company in accordance with our projections 
the company may not be successful in obtaining patents on new technology  protecting its trade secrets and conducting its business without infringing on the rights of others  which could adversely affect its business 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to obtain and enforce patents  maintain trade secret protection  and conduct its business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if others develop competing technologies and market competing products  the company s sales could be adversely affected 
if the company is not able to maintain its trade secrets or to enforce its patents  the company s competitive position could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company licenses technology from third parties 
if the company cannot maintain these licenses  or if it cannot obtain licenses to other useful technology on commercially reasonable terms  its research efforts could be adversely affected 
any inability to adequately protect the company s proprietary technologies could harm its competitive position 
furthermore  litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require the company to spend time and money and could shut down some of its operations 
because the company may not be able to obtain appropriate patents or licenses  it may not be able to successfully operate its business 
the company intends to conduct proprietary research programs  and any conflicts with its strategic partners could harm its business 
we may not be able to keep up with advances in technology rapid technological development by the company or others may result in products or technologies becoming obsolete before it recovers the expenses it incurs in connection with their development 
genomic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
the company s future success will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the integration of functional genomics with plant transformation and evaluation 
rapid technological development by the company or others may result in products or technologies becoming obsolete before it recovers the expenses incurred in connection with their development 
products offered by the company  its customers or its strategic partners could be made obsolete by less expensive or more effective crop enhancement and nutrition enhancement technologies  including technologies that may be unrelated to genomics 
the company may not be able to make the enhancements to its technology necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
we may lose the scientists and management personnel necessary to implement our business plan the company depends on the services of a number of key personnel  and a loss of any of these personnel could disrupt operations and result in reduced revenues 
the realization of the company s new business strategy depends on  among other things  its ability to adapt management information systems and controls and to hire  train and retain qualified employees to allow operations to be effectively managed 
we may not be able to compete effectively in our industry the company faces significant competition in its chosen fields novel crop production traits and specialized technology services 
the company may not be able to compete effectively  which could cause its business to suffer 
both traditional and specialized agricultural chemical firms offer competing technology eg  traditional chemicals and biopesticides that can be deployed against fungal disease and nematodes pests 
several agricultural chemical firms offer novel crop protection traits through biotechnology as well 
several specialized biotechnology research firms offer pesticide target discovery of target pathogens  pests or weed species 
these biotechnology research firms may also compete with us in providing specialized technology services 
there are also many companies engaged in research and product development activities based on agricultural biotechnology 
competitors include specialized biotechnology firms  as well as major pharmaceutical  food and chemical companies that have biotechnology divisions  many of which have considerably greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than the company 
competition may intensify as technological developments occur at a rapid rate in the agricultural biotechnology industry 
we may not complete the development of  or be able to successfully commmercialize new technology products and services if the products the company develops and markets are not commercial successes  it will not recoup its development and production costs  which will hurt its financial condition 
the company is currently in the early stages of research and development  and there can be no assurance that any of its projects will be successful or will produce significant revenues or profits 
the success of these and future products depends on many variables  including technical risks associated with using genetic engineering for crop protection and nutrition  business risks associated with selecting commercial targets and capturing value from customers 
the company may be sued for product liability  which  if a suit were successful  could cause it to face substantial liabilities that exceed its resources 
the company may be held liable if any product it develops  or any product that is made using its technologies  causes injury or is found unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
these risks are inherent in the development of agricultural and food products 
the company currently does not have product liability insurance 
if it chooses to obtain product liability insurance  but cannot obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  the commercialization of products that the company s customers  strategic partners  or that it develops may be prevented 
if the company is sued for any injury caused by its products  its liability could exceed its total assets 
we may not gain public acceptance for our genetically engineered products if the public is unwilling to accept genetically engineered products  the company will not recoup its development and production costs  which will hurt its financial condition 
social and environmental concerns may limit the acceptance of genetically engineered products 
most of the company s products are being developed through the use of genetic engineering 
the commercial success of these products will depend in part on public acceptance of the cultivation and consumption of genetically engineered products 
the company cannot assure you that these products will gain sufficient public acceptance to be profitable  even if these products obtain the required regulatory approvals 
public debate surrounding food and fiber crops enhanced through biotechnology has recently intensified in the united states and internationally 
technology critics have urged us regulatory agencies to tighten their regulation of biotechnology crops  including withdrawal of certain product registrations  implementation of product labeling  and stricter pre market approval procedures 
internationally  agricultural biotechnology issues are being debated within the world trade organization  the united nations convention on biological diversity  the codex alimentarius  and on several regional fronts 
the company believes that progress has been made to ensure that science based rules form the basis for international trade of agricultural biotechnology products 
however  the extent of government regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative actions and the potential consequences to the business is not known and cannot be predicted with certainty 
government regulation government regulation can cause delays and increased costs  which may decrease the company s revenues and profitability 
stringent laws may limit the market for genetically engineered agricultural products that it may develop 
business opportunities and products developed using technology developed by the company may be subject to a lengthy and uncertain government regulatory process that may not result in the necessary approvals  may delay the commercialization of its customers products or may be costly  which could harm its business 
the company s activities in the united states are extensively regulated by the food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture  the environmental protection agency  and other federal and state regulatory agencies in the united states 
also  the company s genetically engineered products may require regulatory approval or notification in the united states or in other countries in which they are tested  used or sold 
the regulatory process may delay research  development  production  or marketing and require more costly and time consuming procedures  and there can be no assurance that requisite regulatory approvals or registration of the company s current or future genetically engineered products will be granted on a timely basis 
savia and bionova international  inc 
have substantial control over the company and can affect virtually all decisions made by its stockholders and directors bii beneficially owns  shares of our common stock accounting for of all issued and outstanding shares 
as a result  bii has the requisite voting power to significantly affect virtually all decisions made by the company and its stockholders  including the power to elect all directors and to block corporate actions such as an amendment to most provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation 
this ownership and management structure will inhibit the taking of any action by the company that is not acceptable to bii 
we may incur significant liability as a result of stockholder lawsuits the company and its subsidiary  dna plant technology corporation  have been sued in several lawsuits relating to the merger transaction the merger in which dnap became a subsidiary of the company 
in some of those lawsuits  the former preferred stockholders of dnap alleged they should have received much more consideration for their shares in the merger than they did 
though the trial courts in these cases dismissed all of the claims  the appellate court reversed the trial court in one case and a second case is still pending before a different appellate court 
if the company is ultimately found to be liable in these cases  the value of the potential judgment could be far more than the company could afford to pay 
agribusiness risks extreme weather conditions  disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of strawberry starter plants of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not affect a portion of the company s revenues in any year and have a material adverse effect on its business 
defective starter plants could result in warranty claims and negative publicity  and the insurance covering warranty claims may become unavailable or be inadequate  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements disclosed in this section and otherwise in this report
