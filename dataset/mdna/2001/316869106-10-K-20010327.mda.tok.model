results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of incom e data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated december  as a percentage of total revenue revenue software customer support professional services and education hardware other total revenue cost of revenue software customer support professional services and education hardware other total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles  restructuring  in process research and development  and other costs total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net net income before tax revenue total revenue increased to million in from milli on in and from million in  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to this increase was largely due to an increase in our customer base  broader software functionality and new product introductions  and an increased emphasis on professional services 
software revenue consists of revenue from the licensing of our softwa re products to customers 
software revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to these increases were primarily attributable to large scale deployments of our software products  as well as growth in the number of our customers 
these expanded deployments were largely the result of web enabled architecture introduced in customer support revenue consists of revenue from software maintenan ce contracts and fee for service revenues 
customer support revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing increases of million  or  from to  and  or  from t o this increase in customer support revenue was primarily due to the growth in our customer base as a result of new customer sales and sales of additional products to our installed base 
professional services and education revenue is generated primarily f rom consulting and implementation services provided to end users of our software products  technical consulting services provided to our resellers and training services 
professional services are generally performed on a time and material basis 
professiona l services and education revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  r epresenting increases of million  or  from to  and million  or  from to this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in custom development projects  and to a lesser extent  an increase in sales of prepack aged service offerings  which include both consulting and training 
we plan to continue to focus on expanding our professional se rvices capabilities to support our solutions oriented strategy 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from the sale of inch o sars  spare parts  supplies and third party products 
hardware revenue increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in  representing an increase of million  or  from to and a decrease of  or  from to the increase in was primarily due to increased demand for gigabyte drives 
we believe the d ecrease in was partly attributable to reluctance of customers to deploy new hardware products as a result of yk uncertainty 
we anticipate hardware revenue will decline as a percentage of total revenue in as a service to our customers  other revenue is generated primarily from the sale of spare parts  supplies and third party products 
other revenue decreased to million in from mill ion in and decreased from million in  representing a decrease of million  or  from to and a decr ease of million  or  from to this decrease in other revenue was primarily due to a decrease in demand for sp are parts and the elimination of sales of third party products 
we anticipate other revenue will continue to be a small percentage o f total revenue in international revenues accounted for of total revenue or million in  or million in  and or million in a significant portion of international sales are denominated in the local currency of the country where sold 
the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies negat ively impacted revenue reported in us dollars in and to a lesser extent in additionally  the lower percentage in as compared to was attributable to a weakness in order levels in the european market as a result of customers and prospective customers concerns over yk 
we expect international revenue to continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue 
cost of revenue total cost of revenue increased to million in fro m million in and from million in  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to this increase was largely due to increases in cost in our service segments offset in part by decr eases in software cost 
cost of software revenue includes royalties paid to third parties  media costs  and the cost to manufacture and distribute software 
the cost of software revenue decreased to million in fr om million in and from million in  representing  and of software revenue  respectively 
the decrea se as a percentage of software revenue is primarily attributable to distribution costs which remained constant while revenue in creased  as well as a reduction in royalty costs due to the unbundling and discontinuation of certain third party products 
cost of customer support revenue includes customer support perso nnel  supplies  and the cost of third party hardware maintenance 
the cost of customer support revenue increased to mil lion in from million in and from million in however  cost as a percentage of customer support revenue decreased to in compared to in and in the decrease in and was primarily attributable to process improvement that allowed growth in the customer base without a proportional increase in support personnel and cost 
the decreas e in was due to the higher proportion of fees for service revenue  as opposed to contract maintenance revenue and the transitio n of high cost hardware maintenance services to a third party contractor 
cost of professional services and education revenue consists pr imarily of professional services personnel  training personnel  and third party contractors 
the cost of professional services an d education revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of professional services and education revenue  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increases in personnel  whose compensation expense was not fully absorbed by increases in revenue because new professional services person nel require intensive training before they are fully productive 
cost of hardware revenue includes the cost of assembling our osar library products  the cost of hardware integration personnel  warranty costs as well as the distribution costs of these produ cts 
the cost of hardware revenue increased to million in from million in and decreased from millio n in  representing  and of hardware revenue  respectively 
the increased cost of hardware revenue as a perce nt of hardware revenue in was primarily due to increased warranty cost as compared to the prior two years 
cost of other revenue includes the cost of supplies  spare parts and third party products as well as the distribution costs of these products 
the cost of other revenue decreased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of other revenue  respectively 
the fluctuatio n in cost of other revenue as a percent of other revenue is primarily due to a variety of small factors including vendor price variabili ty 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense consis ts primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
research and development expense increased to million i n from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to market driven increases in salaries and recruiting costs as a result of the intense competitive env ironment for software engineers and an increase in the rates of contract developers 
we expect that competition for qualified technical personnel will r emain intense for the foreseeable future and may result in higher levels of compensation expense for us 
we believe that research and development expenditures  including compensation of technical personnel  are essential to maintaining our competitive positi on and expect these costs to continue to constitute a significant percentage of total revenue 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administr ative expense increased to million in from million in and from million in selling  general and a dministrative expense  as a percentage of total revenue was in  in and in the decrease as a percent of total revenue is primarily due to cost containment measures and expense control  along with higher revenue 
the increase in ab solute dollars is primarily due to performance based incentives  recruitment costs for new sales personnel and higher depreciation c osts 
purchased in process research and development 
based upon a n independent third party appraisal  we allocated approximately million to in process research and development which was an element of the purchase price of application partners  incorporated api 
the in process research and development expenses related to new product projects that were under development at the date of the acquisition and were expected to eventually lead to new product s but had not yet established feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified 
the valuation of the in process research and development projects was based upon the discounted expected future net cash flows of the products over their expected l ife  reflecting the estimated percent of completion of the projects and an estimate of the costs to complete the projects 
new product development projects underway at api at the time of the acquisition included sequis  an eservice application which we estimated to be complete at the date of the acquisition 
the cost to complete the project was estimated at approximately  to occur o ver a three month period 
we incurred approximately  of research and development expenses related to the project which was complete as of september  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
in conjunction with our acquisition of api in may  the purchase price amount allocated to goodwill was million  which is being amortized ov er five years 
the purchase price amount allocated to assembled workforce was  which is being amortized over three years 
a mortization expense in was million 
restructuring and other costs 
the million in restructuring and other costs in represents the costs of a reduction in headcount associated with the restructuring of our sales and ma rketing operations  as well as costs of consolidating facilities 
the restructuring and other costs include approximately mil lion for severance payments for employees   for facility closing costs and  of other charges 
estimated costs approximated actual costs incurred 
at december   there were no remaining accrued restructuring and other costs included in other accrued liabilities as all amounts have been paid 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and other items including fore ign exchange gains and losses  the gain on sale of fixed assets  other items of income  and interest expense 
other income  net of ot her expenses  was million in  million in and million in the increase in was primarily attributable to increases in interest income directly related to higher cash balances  a foreign exchange gain for the year  which was partia lly offset by increases in other expense related to an accrual of million for a pending legal settlement 
the decrease in w as primarily attributable to increased foreign exchange losses and increased interest expense associated with our foreign currency hedge activities which was partially offset by increases in interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in  compared to million in and  in the effective tax rate was  and for th e years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduced tax rate in was primarily due to earnings gener ated in low tax foreign jurisdictions  partially offset by the generation of domestic taxable income before stock option deductions and utilization of deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents  and investments were million  an increase of million from the million at december  cash provided by operating activities in was million and resulted primarily from an increase in net income  an increase in unearned maintenance revenue related to prepaid maintenance co ntracts  additions to net income for depreciation and amortization expense and income tax benefit from stock options offset by an in crease in accounts receivable  an increase in deferred tax  and an increase in prepaid expenses 
cash used by investing activities i n totaled million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures  cash paid for acquisitions  and the net sale and maturi ty of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities in was million  consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of common stock under the employee and non employee director stock purchase pla n

cash provided by financing activities in was million  consisting of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  and the issuance of common stock under t he employee and non employee director stock purchase plan  offset in part by the cost to repurchase common stock 
our capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in our primary capital expenditures during these years were for research and development equipment  demonstration and training equipment  enhancements to our internal network and business systems  leasehold improvements on lea sed property  and furniture 
the increase in capital expenditures in over the levels in and was primarily due to larg e internal information technology infrastructure and systems projects  as well as expenditures incurred to improve and furnish ou r new office in kirkland  washington 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased million of our common stock 
we anticipate that our present cash balances  together with internal ly generated funds and credit lines  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures throughout  which are anticipated to be approximately million 
other matters european monetary union 
on january   of the member coun tries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
these count ries have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency from that date 
these countries will issue sovereign debt exclusivel y in euro and will re denominate outstanding sovereign debt 
effective on this date  these countries no longer control their o wn monetary policies by directing independent interest rates for the legacy currencies 
instead  the authority to direct monetary po licy  including money supply and official interest rates for the euro  is exercised by the new european central bank 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in these countries a s a denomination of the euro between january  and january  during this transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis 
however  conversion rates no longer will be computed directly from one legacy currency to another 
instead  a triangulation process will b e applied whereby an amount denominated in one legacy currency first will be converted into an amount denominated in euro  and the resultant euro denominated amount is converted into the second legacy currency 
we have made the necessary interim changes to our internal business sy stems to support transactions denominated in the euro  including establishing euro price lists for affected countries 
in w e will complete the system changes required to fully implement euro reporting requirements 
we have evaluated the impact the conv ersion to the euro will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on this evaluation to date  we currently do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of the euro conversion recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  staff accou nting bulletin sab no 
was issued to provide staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to rev enue recognition in financial statements 
sab is effective no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this statement and evaluated the impact of this bulletin on our consolidated financial statem ents and believe it did not and will not have a material impact on our results of operations or equity 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issu ed statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sf as no 
as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  establishes accoun ting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives and now may meet the definition of a derivative 
additionally  this standard will require us to re cord all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are hedges  changes in the fair value of derivatives will be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments 
we have adopted this standard ef fective january  and have evaluated the impact of adopting this statement on the consolidated financials statements an d believe it will not be material to the results of our operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  which  among other things  addresse d accounting consequences of a modification that reduces the exercise price of a fixed stock option award otherwise known as repricin g 
if the exercise price of a fixed stock option award is reduced  the award must be accounted for as variable price stock plan fro m the date of the modification to the date the award is exercised  is forfeited  or expires unexercised 
the exercise price of an option award has been reduced if the fair value of the consideration required to be paid by the grantee upon exercise is les s than or potentially less than the fair value of the consideration that was required to be paid pursuant to the award s original t erms 
the requirements about modifications to fixed stock option awards that directly or indirectly reduce the exercise price o f an award apply to modifications made after december   and will be applied prospectively as of july  the adoption of this interpretation did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ establi shed policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable sec urities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than three years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  report ed in a separate component of stockholder s equity 
foreign currency risk 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due from and the net assets of selected subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies main ly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward foreign exchange contract s for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contract s as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on foreign exchang e contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
if an underlying hedge d transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exch ange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign curre ncy denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
our forward contracts generally have an origin al maturity of three months 
the total notional values of forward contracts purchased and forward contracts sold in were million and million  respectively 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on financi al results see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that inflation has not had a significant impact o n the price of our products  the cost of our materials  or our operating results for each of the three years ended december
