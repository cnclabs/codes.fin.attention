consolidated results of operations autonation  inc is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated approximately new vehicle franchises from dealership locations in major metropolitan markets in states  predominantly in the sunbelt 
our dealerships offer new and used vehicles for sale 
we also offer financing for vehicle purchases  extended service contracts and other finance and insurance products  as well as other aftermarket products such as vehicle accessories  upgraded sound systems and theft deterrent systems

in addition  within management s discussion and analysis  we have also expanded our disclosures to provide revenue and gross margin detail by line of business 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation 
the following is a summary of our consolidated income statements both in gross dollars and on a diluted per share basis for the periods indicated in millions  except per share data gross diluted gross diluted gross diluted dollars per share dollars per share dollars per share income loss from continuing operations

the following factors have impacted our financial condition and results of operations and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results o growth through acquisitions from through  we expanded our automotive retail operations through the acquisition of franchised automotive dealerships as discussed under the heading business acquisitions and divestitures 
o spin off of anc rental corporation in june  we completed the tax free spin off of our former automotive rental businesses 
these businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations as further discussed under the heading discontinued business segments 
o sale of republic services  inc in  our former solid waste services business completed an initial public offering of of its common stock 
in  we sold substantially all of our remaining interests in republic services to the public 
see further discussion under the heading discontinued business segments

o share repurchases since the inception of our board authorized share repurchase programs in  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of billion through march  see further discussion under the heading financial condition 
unless otherwise stated  the following discussions will focus on the results of continuing operations  which consists of our automotive retail business 
same store operating data our historical operating results include the results of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition for acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
due to our expansion through acquisitions as well as the impact of divestitures  year over year comparisons of our reported operating results do not necessarily provide a meaningful representation of our internal performance 
accordingly  we have presented below our operating results for the years ended december  and on a same store basis to better reflect our internal performance 
the following table sets forth the components of same store revenue  with component percentages of total revenue  the components of same store gross margin  with gross margin percentages of applicable same store revenue  same store selling  general and administrative expenses  same store performance  and retail vehicle same store unit sales for the years ended december in millions revenue new vehicle   used vehicle   fixed operations   finance and insurance other   gross margin new vehicle used vehicle fixed operations finance and insurance other s  g a store   store performance retail vehicle unit sales new   used   same store revenue was billion for the year ended december  compared to billion for the year ended december   an increase of

same store gross margin as a percentage of same store total revenue was for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  the primary components of same store revenue and gross margin increases are described below 
our new vehicle same store revenue increased to billion during the year ended december  due to price increases of offset by a decrease in volume of 
new vehicle same store gross margin increased to million during the year ended december  new vehicle same store gross margins for and were of same store new vehicle revenue 
in  the automotive retail industry experienced strong new vehicle unit sales until the fourth quarter when new vehicle demand dramatically slowed 
we expect lower new vehicle demand to continue in  which will likely result in significantly lower new vehicle revenue and gross margin 
the used vehicle market was softer in compared to due in part to strong manufacturer incentives for new vehicles  especially light trucks 
same store used vehicle revenue decreased to billion during the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to lower volume of offset by higher average prices 
despite the decline in revenue  used vehicle same store gross margin increased slightly to million during the year ended december  due to an expansion in gross margin of basis points to fixed operations same store revenue increased to billion during the year ended december  driven primarily by volume 
same store fixed operations gross margin increased to million during the year ended december   as a result of higher revenue coupled with margin expansion of basis points to 
same store finance and insurance revenue and gross margin increased to million during the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a higher percentage of our customers buying finance and insurance products 
same store selling  general and administrative expenses were billion during the year ended december  versus billion for the year ended december  same store selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of same store total revenue were for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the impact of cost cutting initiatives and overall leveraging of the store cost structure 
same store performance was million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  same store performance margins as a percentage of same store total revenue were for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  the increases in same store performance margins in aggregate dollars and as percentages of same store revenue are primarily due to decreases in s  g a  coupled with gross margin expansion in used vehicles and fixed operations

we incurred million of property carrying costs during the year ended december  we expect these costs to be less than million in discontinued business segments on june   we completed the spin off of our former automotive rental businesses  which have been organized under anc rental corporation  by distributing of anc rental s common stock to autonation s stockholders as a tax free dividend 
as a result of the spin off  autonation stockholders received one share of anc rental common stock for every eight shares of autonation common stock owned as of the june  record date

see note  discontinued operations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of these discontinued operations 
business acquisitions and divestitures from through  we aggressively expanded our automotive retail operations through the acquisition of franchised automotive dealerships 
however  we did not complete in and do not expect to complete in acquisitions at the same pace as we have in the past 
future acquisitions will primarily target single dealerships or small dealership groups focused in key existing markets 
during the year ended december   we acquired various automotive retail businesses 
we paid approximately million in cash for these acquisitions  all of which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
during  we also paid approximately million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions 
at december   we accrued approximately million of deferred purchase price due to former owners of acquired businesses 
as described below under the heading restructuring activities  we have been divesting of certain non core franchised automotive dealerships 
during  we received approximately million of cash from the divestiture of certain dealerships 
we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our flemington dealer group 
we expect to complete the sale in the second quarter of following the sale of the flemington group  we will have substantially completed our non core dealership divestiture plan 
in november  we completed the divestiture of our outdoor media business for a purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with the sale  we entered into a prepaid million advertising agreement and therefore  we received net proceeds of million 
a pre tax gain of million was recognized on the sale 
during the year ended december   we acquired various automotive retail businesses 
we paid approximately million in cash for these acquisitions  all of which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
during  we also paid approximately million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions 
during  we received approximately million of cash from the divestiture of various automotive dealerships

during  we received approximately million of cash from the divestiture of various automotive dealerships 
see note  business acquisitions and divestitures  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of business combinations 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we approved a plan to restructure certain of our operations 
the restructuring plan was comprised of the following major components exiting the used vehicle megastore business  and reducing the corporate workforce 
the restructuring plan also included divesting of certain non core franchised dealerships 
approximately  positions were eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan of which  were megastore positions and were corporate positions 
these restructuring activities resulted in pre tax charges of million in of which million appears as asset impairment charges recoveries  net in our consolidated income statement 
these pre tax charges include million of asset impairment charges  million of reserves for residual value guarantees for closed lease properties  million of severance and other exit costs  and million of inventory related costs 
the million asset impairment charge consists of million of megastore and other property impairments  million of goodwill impairment reserves for the divestiture of certain non core franchised automotive dealerships  and million of information systems impairments 
of the million restructuring reserve recorded  million of severance was paid in and million of asset impairments and write offs were recorded during the fourth quarter of we intend to complete the sale of our flemington dealer group during the second quarter of as described under the heading  business acquisitions and divestitures  resulting in the substantial completion of our non core dealership divestiture plan 
we continue to dispose of our closed megastores and other properties through sales to third parties 
although we are aggressively marketing these closed properties  the ultimate disposition will not be substantially completed until late revenue for the operations disposed or to be disposed was million  billion and billion during  and  respectively 
operating income for the operations disposed or to be disposed was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following summarizes activity in the restructuring and impairment reserves for the year ended december  deductions balance amounts charged balance reserve december  credited to income cash non cash december  asset reserves asset impairment inventory accrued liabilities property lease residual value guarantees severance and other exit costs finance lease residual value write down includes million of reserves that had been established on these properties prior to the restructuring and impairment charges recorded 
the following summarizes the components of the million amount credited to income during the year ended december  properties placed back net gain on additional into service or retained sold properties impairment charges other total asset reserves asset impairment accrued liabilities property lease residual value guarantees severance and other exit costs finance lease residual value write down during  certain events occurred which caused us to re evaluate our plans with respect to various retail properties 
as a result  certain megastore properties were placed back in service and we decided to retain certain dealerships that had been held for sale 
accordingly  based on our re evaluation of the fair value of the properties  we determined that the asset impairment and lease residual value reserves for these properties were no longer necessary and we were required to reverse the related estimated reserves totaling million back into income 
an additional impairment charge of million was recognized primarily related to a decision in to close one additional megastore property as part of the overall restructuring plan 
during  we also recognized an impairment charge totaling million associated with the deterioration in residual values of finance lease receivables 
we discontinued writing finance leases in mid and the majority of the leases terminate in late non operating income expense floorplan interest expense floorplan interest expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increases are due to higher floorplan debt associated with higher inventory levels and higher interest rates 
in  we expect to take numerous steps to reduce inventory levels and related floorplan interest expense 
other interest expense other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
other interest expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increases are due to higher average borrowings along with higher interest rates 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to lower cash and investment balances on hand 
the increase in was the result of interest earned on funds temporarily invested from the proceeds of the sale of substantially all of our interest in republic services 
other income  net other income  net  for the year ended december   was million and primarily included gains of approximately million on the sale of approximately million shares of common stock of our former solid waste subsidiary  republic services  and a gain of approximately million on the sale of our former outdoor media business  offset by a million valuation write down related to an equity method investment in a privately held auto salvage and parts recycling business 
income taxes the provision for income taxes from continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was and for the years ended december  and although we reported a pre tax loss from continuing operations in  an income tax provision of million was recorded due to the effect of certain non deductible expenses primarily associated with the restructuring and impairment charges 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will increase to between and in financial condition at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities in place in the aggregate of billion under which million was outstanding 
the unsecured revolving credit facilities may be used for general corporate purposes 
one facility provides billion of financing under a multi year structure and matures april the other  a million day facility was amended prior to its scheduled maturity in march to provide million of capacity until the earlier of september  or the early renewal of the multi year facility 
we also have been negotiating with several of the vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries to provide mortgage backed credit facilities for specific dealership properties 
we finance our vehicle inventory through secured financings  primarily floorplan facilities  with vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries as well as independent financial institutions and  until recently  a bank sponsored commercial paper conduit facility that matured january   and was not renewed 
as of december   committed capacity of the facilities was approximately billion 
we are the lessee under a lease facility that was established to acquire and develop our former megastores properties 
as originally structured  the facility had been accounted for as an operating lease and included residual value guarantees 
in  certain properties under the facility were reflected as capital leases 
in connection with our restructuring activities previously described  as of december   we accrued an estimate of the liability under the residual value guarantee totaling approximately million 
in september  we funded the remaining lease residual value guarantee obligation to the lessor  reduced the facility size from million to million and amended the terms of the facility through the notification of our intention to exercise the option to purchase the leased properties at the end of the term 
as a result of the amendment  all of the leases have now been accounted for as capital leases  with the property and related debt included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
at december   million was outstanding under this facility and is included in long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
of the million outstanding  million is associated with operating properties and million is attributable to properties held for sale 
the facility matures april we securitize installment loan receivables through a billion commercial paper warehouse facility with certain financial institutions 
in september  we decreased the capacity of the commercial paper warehouse facility from billion to billion 
during the year ended december   we securitized approximately million of loan receivables under this program  net of retained interests 
at december   we have approximately million outstanding under this program  net of retained interests 
we have entered into certain interest rate derivative transactions with certain financial institutions to manage the impact of interest rate changes on securitized installment loan receivables 
proceeds from securitizations are primarily used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we also securitize installment loan receivables through the issuance of asset backed notes through a non consolidated special purpose entity under a billion shelf registration statement 
through december   billion  net of retained interests  has been issued and approximately million remains to be issued under this program 
proceeds from these notes are used to refinance installment loans previously securitized under the warehouse facility and to securitize additional loans held by us 
we provide credit enhancement related to these notes in the form of over collateralization  a reserve fund and a third party surety bond 
we retain responsibility for servicing the loans for which we are paid a servicing fee 
during  approximately million in additional asset backed notes were issued  net of retained interests  and at december   billion was outstanding under this program 
we intend to provide for additional capacity through an additional or subsequent shelf registration 
installment loans sold under these programs are nonrecourse beyond our retained interests 
see note  asset securitizations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we expect to continue to securitize installment loan receivables under these facilities and or other programs 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock  par value 
per share  under our board authorized share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we repurchased million shares of common stock during for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
we repurchased million shares of common stock during for an aggregate purchase price of million 
through december   an aggregate of million shares of common stock had been repurchased under our share repurchase programs  authorized by our board of directors in and  for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
as of march   we repurchased an additional million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  leaving approximately million available for share repurchases under the latest authorized program 
we expect to continue repurchasing shares under this program 
repurchases are made pursuant to rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
we will evaluate share repurchases in based upon financial and other investment considerations 
in connection with the anc rental spin off  we made certain capital contributions to anc rental prior to the spin off 
these contributions include cash of approximately million and the net assets of an insurance subsidiary 
we also entered into various agreements with anc rental that set forth the terms of the distribution and other agreements governing our relationship with anc rental after the spin off 
as a result of the spin off  our equity as of december   was reduced by the net assets of anc rental totaling million 
the equity adjustment resulting from the spin off is subject to further adjustment resulting from changes in estimated shared assets and liabilities of autonation and anc rental and certain other matters 
however  such adjustments  if any  are not expected to be significant 
in connection with the spin off  we agreed to continue to provide anc rental with guarantees and other credit enhancements with respect to certain indebtedness and certain property and vehicle lease obligations 
we receive fees for providing these guarantees commensurate with market rates 
to the extent that anc rental is not able to meet its obligations  we would be likely to be called on to perform under guarantees and credit enhancements provided by us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated results of operations  financial condition and or cash flows 
we have taken steps during to further strengthen our balance sheet  including selling non core assets and redeploying proceeds into our core business 
during we entered into a sale leaseback financing of our corporate headquarters facility resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  during we sold an office building which is occupied by anc rental  resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
as previously described  in november we completed the sale of our outdoor media business and expect to complete the sale of our flemington dealer group in the second quarter of at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax liabilities 
we provide for deferred income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
over the past four years we have engaged in certain transactions that are of a type that the internal revenue service has recently indicated it intends to challenge 
we believe that our tax returns appropriately reflect such transactions 
at the present time  it is impossible to predict the outcome of any challenge if the irs determines to challenge the tax reporting of such transactions 
we believe that we have sufficient operating cash flow and other financial resources necessary to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased decreased by million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the major components of these changes are discussed below 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities include purchases of vehicle inventory  which are separately financed through secured vehicle financings 
accordingly  we measure our operating cash flow including net proceeds under these secured vehicle financings which totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
including net proceeds under these secured vehicle financings  we generated operating cash flow of million  million and million during the years ended  and  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash provided by used in business acquisitions and divestitures  capital additions  property dispositions  net activity of installment loan receivables and other transactions as further described below 
cash used in business acquisitions was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in business acquisitions was primarily due to our shift in to acquire single dealerships or small dealership groups focused in key existing markets 
cash used in business acquisitions during includes million in deferred purchase price for certain prior year automotive retail acquisitions

capital expenditures were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures in is due to the megastore closures and fewer acquisitions 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and assets held for sale were million  million and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the sales of megastore and other properties held for sale and the sale of the building occupied by anc rental 
cash received from business divestitures was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in july  our former solid waste subsidiary  republic services  completed an initial public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately billion 
in may  we sold substantially all of our interest in republic services in a public offering resulting in proceeds of approximately billion 
proceeds from the offerings were used to repay non vehicle debt  finance acquisitions  acquire shares under our share repurchase programs and invest in our business 
during  we sold substantially all of our remaining common stock of republic services  resulting in proceeds of approximately million 
funding of installment loan receivables  net of collections  totaled million   million and million in  and  respectively

during the year ended december   we repaid approximately of debt obligations primarily related to amounts financed under a million lease facility amended september from the original capacity of million 
see note  notes payable and long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
during  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving our corporate headquarter facility which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
we will continue to evaluate the best use of our operating cash flow between capital expenditures  share repurchases and acquisitions 
cash flows from discontinued operations cash used in provided by discontinued operations was as follows during the years ended december automotive rental solid waste services cash used in our former automotive rental business during consists primarily of cash used to replace maturing letters of credit which provide credit enhancement for anc rental s vehicle financing 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitute forward looking statements 
all items described are non trading 
our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
these derivatives consist of interest rate swaps  caps and floors which are entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at december   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps 
we have entered into a series of interest rate caps and floors contractually maturing through to manage the impact of interest rate changes on securitized installment loan receivables 
expected maturity dates for interest rate caps and floors in the tables below are based upon the estimated repayment of the underlying receivables after considering estimated prepayments and credit losses 
average rates on interest rate caps and floors are based upon contractual rates 
at times  we use variable to fixed interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate revolving credit and vehicle inventory financing facilities 
expected maturity dates for variable rate debt and interest rate swaps in the tables below are based upon contractual maturity dates 
average pay rates under interest rate swaps are based upon contractual fixed rates 
average interest rates on variable rate debt and average variable receive rates under interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement 
the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
the fair value of interest rate swaps  caps and floors is determined from dealer quotations and represents the discounted future cash flows through maturity or expiration using current rates 
the fair value is effectively the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements

amounts outstanding under this commercial paper facility were million and billion at december  and  respectively 
seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year in part due to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where dealerships may be subject to harsh winters 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative instrument s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  to the extent effective  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas  as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid instruments 
we have adopted sfas as of january  by requiring the use of fair value accounting  adoption of sfas could cause increased volatility in earnings in future periods 
we continue to enter into derivative contracts  which we believe will help minimize this volatility 
in addition  we are evaluating other instruments that would effectively hedge our floating rate debt which we believe will qualify for hedge accounting

sfas revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures
