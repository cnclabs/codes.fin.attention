all of the above is described in more detail in the following paragraphs 
the illinois facility was relocated to provide a more efficient workflow for the operations as well as improved access to the company s distribution channels 
the then existing lease  which was scheduled to expire in june   was with a related party who was in the process of selling the building 
based on a review of the current market demand for the area  it was estimated that the building would be sold by december  therefore  although there was no assurance the building would be sold by december   million representing rent charges to december  were recorded as part of restructuring and other expense in the statement of operations

the ohio facility was vacated and combined with another operation at a site that the company is leasing in connection with an acquisition of a business in cincinnati in september the consolidation of operations is taking place because the company operates three businesses in the cincinnati area and the plan called for locating all three businesses at one site that has excess capacity thereby reducing costs and better coordinating the company s efforts in the mid east regional marketplace

however  the demand for short run products was not as great as management expected 
as a result  the press was idle and a write down of million was taken in the impairment charge 
the remaining net book value is at a level that the company believes it could sell the press for in the used equipment market 
the press was sold at a price in excess of its net book value in june in addition  two high end workstations with a net book value of million were determined to no longer be in use and were written off 
the technology that the workstations used was no longer state of the art and was not as efficient or versatile as more advanced equipment that the company used at that time 
therefore  the salvage value was determined to be negligible 
the balance of the impairment charge relates to over one hundred individual pieces of equipment or software that for the most part were obsolete due to the fast pace of change in technology in the graphics arts industry 
these items were replaced by more modern equipment and as a result  were determined to have a negligible salvage value and were therefore written off completely

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on the company s variable rate debt outstanding at december   a change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately assuming similar interest rates volatility in the future  a near term months change in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
foreign exchange exposure the company has foreign operations that exposes it to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
since changes in translation risk are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity  a change in the foreign exchange rate would not have material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
