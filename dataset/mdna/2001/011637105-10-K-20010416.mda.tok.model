item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of alaris medical and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
overview alaris medical is a holding company for alaris medical systems 
alaris medical also identifies and evaluates potential acquisitions and investments  and performs various corporate functions 
as a holding company  alaris medical currently has no revenues to fund its operating and interest expense and relies on its existing cash  cash generated from operations of alaris medical systems and external financing to meet its obligations 
capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is a leading provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the united states hospital market  with the largest installed base of pump delivery lines channels 
the company is also a leader in the international infusion systems market 
based on installed base of infusion pumps  the company has a number one or two market position in seven western european countries  the number three market position in three countries  the largest installed base of infusion pumps in australia and canada and a developing position in latin america and asia 
the company s infusion systems  which are used to deliver one or more fluids  primarily pharmaceuticals or nutritionals  to patients  consist of single and multi channel infusion pumps and dedicated and non dedicated disposable administration sets ie  plastic tubing and pump interfaces 
in addition  the company is a leading provider of patient monitoring products that measure and monitor temperature  pulse  pulse oximetry and blood pressure  with the largest installed base of hospital thermometry systems in the united states 
the company sells a full range of products through a worldwide direct sales force consisting of over sales persons and through more than distributors to over  hospitals worldwide 
sales by the company s international business unit represented of the company s total sales for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company had sales of million and adjusted ebitda of million 
historically  the company s results of operations have been affected by the cost containment pressures applicable to health care providers 
notwithstanding cost containment pressures  unit sales volume of the company s disposable administration sets increased in every year since  primarily as a result of the growth in its worldwide installed base of infusion pumps 
however  uncertainty remains with regard to future changes within the healthcare industry 
the trend towards managed care and economically motivated buyers in the us may result in continued pressure on selling prices of products and compression on gross margins 
the us marketplace is characterized by consolidation among healthcare providers and purchasers of medical products 
the company s profitability is affected by the use of group purchasing organizations gpos which are better able to negotiate favorable pricing from providers of infusion systems  such as the company  and which insure compliance with exclusive buying arrangements for their members 
these buying arrangements  in certain situations  also may result in the gpo requiring removal of the company s existing infusion pumps 
as a result  gpos may have an adverse effect on the company s future profitability 
finally  the enactment of national health care reform or other legislation affecting payment mechanisms and health care delivery could affect the company s future results of operations 
it is impossible to predict the extent to which the company may be affected by any such change in legislation

liquidity and capital resources alaris medical expects to continue to meet its liquidity needs during  including capital expenditure requirements  with cash flow from operations of alaris medical systems 
alaris medical systems will continue to use its funds primarily for operating expenses  including planned expenditures for new research and development programs  capital expenditures and scheduled payments on outstanding indebtedness 
at december   the company had outstanding indebtedness of million 
alaris medical systems has a credit facility with a group of banks and other lenders consisting of term loans and a revolving credit facility the credit facility 
indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at floating rates based  at the company s option  on eurodollar or prime rates 
the indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of alaris medical systems and is guaranteed by alaris medical 
at december   outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility was million 
in addition to indebtedness under the credit facility  at december   alaris medical systems also had outstanding million of senior subordinated notes due the notes and alaris medical had outstanding million of convertible subordinated debentures due january  the convertible debentures 
in addition  alaris medical had outstanding million including accretion of senior discount notes due the senior discount notes 
interest accruing on the senior discount notes is added to the outstanding principal balance through july  interest accruing subsequent to july  is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on february and august  commencing february  the company projected not meeting certain financial covenants contained in the credit facility agreement 
as a result  in april the company obtained an amendment the amendment to the terms of the credit facility 
the amendment included the following i a provision providing for changes to certain financial performance covenants for each applicable period from march  through december  ii a provision providing for increases to the interest rates on each of the debt tranches see note to the consolidated financial statements  iii a provision providing for a decrease in the line of credit from million to million  and iv a provision allowing alaris medical systems to borrow as part of the credit agreement or otherwise up to an additional million from a lender it must first locate and to use the funds so borrowed to repurchase convertible debentures 
the million is the maximum that can be borrowed by alaris medical systems under the terms of the notes and used for this purpose 
the changes to the financial performance covenants were developed based on the company s strategic plans and were designed to allow the company access to the million credit line 
the credit facility and the indenture governing the notes the notes indenture permit alaris medical systems to fund interest payments on the convertible debentures in the case of the credit facility  so long as there exists no default or event of default thereunder 
however  both the credit facility and the notes indenture prohibit alaris medical systems from making those distributions to alaris medical which would enable it to fund such repayment  unless alaris medical systems has achieved certain financial performance targets 
since management does not believe that alaris medical systems will meet such tests  it is exploring various alternatives under which those repayment obligations could be satisfied 
for example  management has had preliminary discussions with the administrative agent under the credit facility and has been informed that certain lenders have expressed interest in lending the allowed million to alaris medical systems as part of the credit agreement 
management believes that the terms provided in the amendment for this borrowing should be sufficient to obtain this borrowing 
however  since no lender has yet actually agreed to do so  there can be no assurance that alaris medical systems will be able to borrow the million it is seeking 
in any event  a default by alaris medical on all or any portion of its million outstanding principal payment obligations under the convertible debentures  whether as a result of the company s failure to obtain the funds necessary to purchase  or repay  all outstanding convertible debentures  or otherwise  would likely result in an event of default under  and possible acceleration of the obligations under  the credit facility  the notes and the senior discount notes 
management believes that if the company can successfully arrange for the repayment or purchase of the convertible debentures at  or prior to  maturity  it will generate cash flow from operations  together with its existing cash  sufficient  on both a long and short term basis  to fund its operations  make planned capital expenditures and make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments under the credit facility and interest payments on the notes 
however  on a long term basis  the company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled interest payments on the senior discount notes beginning in  repay the notes at maturity in  or to repay the senior discount notes at maturity in accordingly  the company may have to seek to refinance the notes and the senior discount notes at or prior to maturity or sell assets or raise equity capital to service its indebtedness in the long term 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in such efforts 
based on current interest rates and debt outstanding as of december   the company is required over the next twelve months  to make principal and interest payments under its credit facility in the amount of million and interest payments on the notes and the convertible debentures in the amount of million and million  respectively 
annual principal amortization of the company s indebtedness is million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in addition  the company s ability to fund its operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled principal and interest payments and to meet the financial performance covenants in the amended credit facility will depend on the company s future operating performance  which is itself dependent on a number of factors  many of which the company cannot control  including conditions affecting the company s foreign operations  prevailing economic conditions  availability of other sources of liquidity  and financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the company s business and operations

health care reform heightened public awareness and concerns regarding the growth in overall health care expenditures in the united states may result in the enactment of legislation affecting payment mechanisms and health care delivery 
legislation which imposes limits on the number and type of medical procedures which may be performed or which has the effect of restricting a provider s ability to select specific devices or products for use in administrating medical care may adversely impact the demand for the company s products 
in addition  legislation which imposes restrictions on the price which may be charged for medical products may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which the company or the health care industry in general may be adversely affected by the aforementioned in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments the company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
as of december   the company had completed the preparatory steps to initiate a foreign exchange risk management program commencing with the upcoming fiscal period 
under the program  the company will utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
consistent with its action in to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility as described in preceding paragraphs  the company continued its use of interest rate swap derivatives during the swap agreement entered into in expired in and a new swap agreement was entered into during the second quarter of with a term extending through january of the company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
foreign exchange risk management as part of the plan to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations  the company anticipates entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases  receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging is to minimize the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cashflows the company receives from its foreign subsidiaries 
all foreign currency contracts are denominated in the currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as investment grade by a major rating agency 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of these exposures are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
the company also enters into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
any gains realized on such options that qualify as hedges are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
premiums on foreign currency options are amortized over the period being hedged 
foreign currency transactions that would not qualify as hedges would be marked to market on a current basis with gains and losses recognized through income and reflected in foreign exchange gains and losses 
in addition  any previously deferred gains and losses on hedges which are terminated prior to the transaction date would be recognized in current income when the hedge is terminated 
as a matter of policy  the company will only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an investment grade or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
the company does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
management believes the risk of loss related to counterparty default is remote and in any event  would not be material 
the contracts will have varying maturities with none exceeding twelve months 
costs associated with entering into contracts are not expected to be material to our financial results 
the company does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   there were no outstanding foreign currency option or forward contracts 
interest rate risk management during the second quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate protection agreement swap covering approximately of its term loan borrowings through february  the swap fixed the interest rate charged on credit facility term borrowings resulting in a weighted average interest rate of as of december  during the second quarter of  the company entered into a new swap with a notional amount of million  expiring in february of the new swap effectively changed the company s interest rate exposure on its floating rate credit facility term debt  resulting in a weighted average interest rate as of december  of 
a increase approximately one percentage point in the applicable interest rate would result in a million annual increase in interest expense 
as noted  the company enters into interest rate protection agreements swaps to convert a portion of floating rate credit facility term debt to fixed rate 
the present swap is an instrument that exchanges floating rate for fixed rate interest rate payments through january of amounts currently due to or from the swap are recorded in interest expense in the period in which they accrue 
the agreement affects interest payments for million of principal of the outstanding credit facility term debt 
market risk the company will incur option premium cost in connection with its foreign currency hedging activities 
the option premium cost represents the entire risk associated with these derivatives 
option premium costs are amortized over the life of the option contract 
the company has not incurred any direct cost in connection with the swap agreement 
however  since entering into the agreement  the fair value of the swap has become negative 
at december  the negative market value of the swap is million 
should the company terminate the swap in advance of expiration  the cost to the company could be material 
euro transition on january   the eleven member countries of the european union began the transition to a common currency  the euro 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies were fixed irrevocably as of january  with the participating national currencies to be removed from circulation between january and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage 
the company is currently evaluating the effect of this transition and at the present time  management does not believe the euro transition will have a materially adverse impact on its business 
accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s fiscal quarter beginning january  date of transition and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if certain conditions are met  where the derivative instrument has been designated as a fair value hedge  the hedged item may also be marked to market through earnings  thus creating an offset 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument may be recorded on the balance sheet as other comprehensive income 
the new accounting standard has not significantly affected the company s approach to managing interest rate and foreign currency risk 
the company plans to hedge against these exposures using forward exchange contracts  foreign currency options  interest rate swaps and options 
these contracts have been designated as hedges of anticipated future cashflows and accordingly  will be marked to market through other comprehensive income balance sheet adjustment until such time as the related anticipated transactions affect earnings 
no foreign exchange hedging instruments were outstanding during the interest rate protection agreement entered into in had a negative market value of million at december   which would be the cost for the company to terminate the swap as of that date 
under sfas no 
 a derivative designated as a hedge must meet an effectiveness test 
if a hedged liability contains provisions permitting pre payment  the effectiveness test must be based on the long method 
alaris uses the long method effectiveness test and has determined the swap is a highly effective hedge 
consequently  changes in the swap fair value will be reflected on the balance sheet as other comprehensive income 
additional information on market risk is set forth under the subcaption liquidity and capital resources contained under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item
