sab  as amended in june  which summarizes the staffs views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company adopted sab during the fourth quarter of the adoption did not have a significant effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when all criteria outlined in statement of position sop software revenue recognition as amended are met 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
where software arrangements involve multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the relative fair values of each element in the arrangement  in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
the company s vsoe used to allocate the sales price to services and maintenance is based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
license revenues are recorded based on the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements when there is vsoe of the fair values of all the undelivered elements  and all revenue recognition criteria of sop  as amended  are satisfied 
under the residual method any discount in the arrangement is allocated to the delivered element 
sop specifies that extended payment terms in a software licensing arrangement may indicate that the software license fees are not deemed to be fixed or determinable 
in addition  if payment of a significant portion of the software license fees is not due until more than twelve months after delivery  the software license fees should be presumed not to be fixed or determinable  and thus should be recognized as the payments become due 
however  sop specifies that if the company has a standard business practice of using extended payment terms in software licensing arrangements and has a history of successfully collecting the software license fees under the original terms of the software licensing arrangement without making concessions  the company overcomes the presumption that the software license fees are not fixed or determinable 
thus  the company should recognize the software license fees when all other sop revenue recognition criteria are met

provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are first determined  in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract 
as of december  no such estimated losses were identified

revenues from maintenance and services are recognized over the life of the maintenance agreement or at the time that services are rendered 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable

impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  market risk the dollar cost of fundtech s operations in israel is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is or is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
inflation in israel will have a negative effect on the profitability to fundtech of contracts under which fundtech is to receive payment in dollars or dollar linked nis while incurring expenses in nis linked to the israeli cpi  unless such inflation is offset by a devaluation of the nis 
for some time until  inflation in israel exceeded the devaluation of the nis against the dollar and fundtech experienced increases in the dollar cost of its operations in israel 
this trend was reversed during and in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation was 
in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation was 
in  israel experienced inflation at the rate of as well as a devaluation of the dollar against the nis at the rate of 
in  the rate of inflation was and the rate of devaluation of the dollar against the nis was at the rate of 
a devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar would have the effect of decreasing the dollar value of any asset of fundtech that consists of nis or receivables payable in nis unless such receivables are linked to the dollar 
such a devaluation would also have the effect of reducing the dollar amount of any expenses or liabilities of fundtech which are payable in nis unless such expenses or payables are linked to the dollar 
conversely  any increase in the value of the nis in relation to the dollar would have the effect of increasing the dollar value of any unlinked nis assets of fundtech and the dollar amounts of any unlinked nis liabilities and expenses of fundtech 
because exchange rates between the nis and the dollar fluctuate continuously albeit with a historically declining trend in the value of the nis  exchange rate fluctuations and especially larger periodic devaluations will have an impact on fundtech s profitability and period to period comparisons of fundtech s results 
such impact is recorded in fundtech s financial statements as financial income or expense 
to date  fundtech has not engaged in currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on fundtech s results of operations
