the following should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations overview we derive our revenues primarily from providing investment management  distribution and administrative services to the funds and managed institutional and separate accounts 
investment management fees  our most substantial source of revenue  are based on the amount of assets under management and are affected by sales levels  financial market conditions  redemptions and the composition of assets 
underwriting and distribution revenues consist of sales charges and commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products  distribution fees  as well as advisory services of legend 
the products sold have various sales charge structures and the revenues received from sales of products vary based on the type and amount sold 
rule b distribution fees earned for distributing certain mutual fund shares are based upon a percentage of assets and fluctuate based on sales  redemptions  and financial market conditions

the deferred selling costs related to the w r funds class b shares in the amount of million pre tax were written off on november  concurrent with the necessary approvals for share conversion 
by offering additional classes of mutual fund shares and closing funds with non industry standard structures  our mutual funds are more consistent with that of the industry  provide our clients with more choices and greater value  and accommodate additional changes for strategic distribution flexibility

this agreement added million of asset based fees to revenues in payments are continuing but the validity and duration of that agreement has been challenged by uilic in a complaint filed in may  in the circuit court of jefferson county  alabama in which we have subsequently named torchmark as a third party defendant in a tortious interference claim 
uilic has taken the position that regardless of the validity of the compensation agreement  the compensation payable pursuant to this agreement terminates on april  management believes that the company will prevail on the merits of the litigation and that compensation pursuant to the july compensation agreement will continue  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  as long as the variable annuity policies assets are in place and the variable annuity policies in question are in force 
moreover  we do not foresee any additional risk to existing variable policy assets and anticipate continued growth in sales of variable annuity products

recent accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  with the instruments measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
this statement was amended in june with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas 
the fasb encourages early adoption of sfas  however  the provisions of the standard should not be retroactively applied to financial statements of periods prior to adoption 
the adoption of sfas  as amended  is not expected to have a material impact on us 
in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which among other guidance  clarifies certain conditions to be met in order to recognize revenue 
sab summarizes some of the sec interpretations of generally accepted accounting principles relating to revenue recognition 
in june  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
b which delayed the implementation of sab until the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  and the provisions are to be retroactively applied to the entire year 
the implementation of sab did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
fin clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb for certain issues 
it does not address any issues related to the application of the fair value method set forth in financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
among other issues  fin clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying apb  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting effects of modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
for those issues that affect us  fin was effective july  we do not expect that the application of fin will have a material impact on the financial statements 
seasonability and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations 
risk factors there may be adverse effects on our revenues  earnings and prospects if the securities markets decline 
our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors  including the level of the securities markets 
we have benefited from the favorable performance of the securities markets in recent years that has attracted a substantial increase in the investments in the securities markets 
a decline in the securities markets  failure of the securities markets to sustain their recent levels of growth or short term volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment  either of which could adversely affect our revenues  earnings and growth prospects 
because our revenues are  to a large extent  investment management fees based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of these assets would adversely affect our revenues 
our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets  and in an adverse economic environment  this may prove difficult 
our growth rate has varied from year to year and there can be no assurance that the average growth rates sustained in the recent past will continue 
the combination of adverse markets effecting sales and investment management fees could compound on each other and materially effect earnings 
adverse conditions in the us domestic stock market are particularly material to us due to high concentration of assets under management in that market 
there may be adverse effects on our revenues and earnings if our funds performance declines 
success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts 
good relative performance stimulates sales of the funds shares and tends to keep redemptions low 
sales of the funds shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues 
good relative performance also attracts private institutional accounts 
conversely  poor relative performance results in decreased sales  increased redemptions of the funds shares and the loss of private institutional accounts  resulting in decreases in revenues 
failure of our funds to perform well could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
there may be an adverse effect on our business if our investors remove the assets we manage on short notice 
a majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with our funds that are terminable on days notice 
each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund s board or its shareholders 
some of these investment management agreements may be terminated or not renewed  and new agreements may be unavailable 
in addition  mutual fund investors may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without any prior notice 
investors can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
the decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we face increased competition in hiring and retaining key personnel and financial advisors 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct our fund management and investment advisory business 
the market for qualified fund managers  investment analysts  and financial advisors is extremely competitive and has grown more so in recent periods because of the growth in the industry 
we are dependent on our sales force and select third party distributors to sell our mutual funds and other investment products 
our growth prospects will be directly affected by the quality and quantity of financial advisors we are able to successfully recruit and retain 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel 
we face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  online and internet investment sites and other financial institutions 
many of these companies not only offer mutual fund investments and services but also offer other financial products and services 
many of our competitors have more products and product lines  services  and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
many larger mutual fund complexes have developed relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks  which may enable these fund complexes to reach broader client bases 
in recent years  there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than us 
there has also been a trend toward online internet financial services 
if existing customers stop investing with us and instead invest with our competitors  or if potential customers decide to invest with our competitors  it would cause our market share  revenues and income to decline 
potential misuse of funds and information in the possession of our advisors could result in liability to our clients 
our financial advisors handle a significant amount of funds and financial and personal information for our clients 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate or that taking or misuse by our employees can be prevented 
we could have liability in the event of a taking or misuse by our employees and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions 
although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any future liability 
there are no assurances that we will pay future dividends 
our board of directors currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on both our class a and class b common stock 
the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board 
any determination as to the payment of dividends  as well as the level of such dividends  will depend on  among other things  general economic and business conditions  our strategic plans  our financial results and condition and contractual  legal  and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and  as such  our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash 
there can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends in any future period 
regulatory risk is substantial in our business 
our investment management business is heavily regulated 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against us  including fines and censures  suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations would adversely affect our reputation  prospects  revenues and earnings 
in addition  changes in current laws or regulations or in governmental policies could adversely affect our operations  revenues and earnings 
provisions of our organizational documents could deter takeover attempts 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without action by our stockholders  to fix certain terms and issue shares of our preferred stock  par value per share 
actions of our board of directors pursuant to this authority may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of the company 
other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and in our bylaws impose procedural and other requirements that could be deemed to have anti takeover effects  including replacing incumbent directors 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes  each of which is to serve for a staggered three year term after the initial classification and election and incumbent directors may not be removed without cause  all of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board 
in addition  as a delaware corporation we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
with certain exceptions  section imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our voting stock 
our stockholders rights plan could deter takeover attempts 
in we adopted a stockholders rights plan pursuant to which rights attached to each share of our then outstanding class a and class b common stock 
generally  the rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of the voting power as represented by our class a and class b common stock 
under certain conditions  the rights entitle the holders to receive shares of our class a common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right 
our stockholders rights plan could impede the completion of a merger  tender offer or other takeover attempt even though some or a majority of our stockholders might believe that a merger  tender offer or takeover is in their best interests and even if such transactions could result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares of our stock over the then current market price of our stock 
the terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations 
there are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital 
we have entered into a loan agreement for a million  day revolving line of credit facility with various lenders 
the facility is expandable to million  whereby the banks could  at their option upon our request  increase the loans by million 
at december   there was no balance outstanding under this line of credit 
in august  we also began utilizing a money market loan program  which functions similarly to commercial paper 
at december   the outstanding balance was million 
the terms and conditions of the revolving credit facility and the money market loan program impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur debt  make capital expenditures  merge  sell assets  make distributions or create or incur liens 
availability of our credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants 
our ability to comply with the covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that comply with the provisions of the credit agreement 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility 
in the event of a default  the banks could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility  all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that borrowings from our existing revolving credit facility  the refinancing of our revolving credit facility  and or cash provided by operating activities  will provide sufficient funds to finance anticipated development plans  meet our operating expenses and service our debt requirements as they become due 
however  in the event that we require additional capital  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our current credit facility upon its maturity or on favorable terms 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
there are no assurances that the combination of our two classes of common stock will be approved or that the expected effects will occur 
our stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to merge the company and a wholly owned subsidiary that will effect the combination of our two classes of common stock into a single class of stock 
if the merger is approved  we anticipate that the combination of our two classes of common stock will have no effect on our business or operations  as currently conducted or afterwards  neither we nor the stockholders will recognize taxable gain or loss upon the conversion of the class b stock and the aggregate tax basis in  and the holding period of  the newly issued shares of class a common stock will be the same as the shares of class b common stock exchanged  the merger will not have any material impact on our stock option plans  other benefit plans or our rights agreement  except for technical amendments to the agreement to eliminate any references to the class b common stock  there will not be any effect on earnings per share or book value per share  the analysis and valuation of a single class of stock will be facilitated  and it will enhance interest in our stock and increase liquidity and trading efficiency 
however  we cannot guarantee or insure that the merger will be approved or  if approved  that any of the anticipated effects  including an increase in liquidity and trading efficiency of the single class of common stock  will occur 
systems failure may disrupt our business 
our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems  including our mutual fund transfer agency system maintained by a third party service provider 
we are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and also on the proper functioning of computer systems of third parties 
we rely heavily on financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
if any of these do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to expand could be affected 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot insure that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by a fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  act of war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
we may have difficulty executing our acquisition strategy 
we have adopted a strategy to selectively pursue acquisitions and alliances that will add new products or alternative distribution systems 
there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to realize our acquisition strategy or be successful in entering into definitive agreements for desired acquisitions 
in addition  we have limited experience in finding  acquiring and integrating other companies and we may not be successful in the integration of acquired companies 
an acquisition may not prove to add new products or distribution systems or otherwise be advantageous to us 
the restructuring of our mutual fund products to enhance our competitiveness and distribution channels may not be successful 
in october  we commenced restructuring our mutual fund products by offering additional classes of mutual fund shares and closing non industry standard classes in an effort to enhance our competitiveness and strategic distribution alternatives and favorably impact our distribution margin 
we anticipate that the product restructuring will result in our product line being more consistent with the industry  providing our clients with more choices and greater value  and accommodating additional changes for strategic distribution flexibility 
there can be no assurances that the restructuring of our mutual fund products will enhance our competitiveness and distribution channels or that it will favorably impact our distribution margin 
our holding company structure results in structural subordination and may affect our ability to make payments on our senior unsecured notes 
on january   we completed a universal shelf offering of million principal amount of senior notes due the notes represent senior unsecured obligations exclusively of waddell reed financial  inc we are a holding company and  accordingly  substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flow and our ability to service our debt  including the notes  is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries 
in addition  we are dependent on the distribution of earnings  loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities 
our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances to by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization  and therefore the right of the holders of the notes to participate in those assets  would be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors 
in addition  even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries  our rights as a creditor would subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
our cash equivalents and short term investments and our outstanding short term debt bear variable interest rates 
we have not used derivative instruments to offset the exposure to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
as noted in item  our revenues and net income are based in part on the value of the investment portfolios managed 
accordingly  financial market declines will negatively impact our assets under management and  in turn  its revenues and profitability
