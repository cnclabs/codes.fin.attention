the net loss for was  or per share 
for   of the loss is due to the non cash allocation of heartland s losses 
heartland s losses are allocated to the owners capital accounts until the accounts have a zero balance 
losses are then allocated to the remaining partners with positive balances

electronics business dependence on debt financing 
the company is dependent on existing sources of debt financing 
the cash outflows used in the recent activities  require that borrowings be available under existing lines of credit for day to day cash requirements 
if the current trends in the industry or significant fluctuations in operations and results continue  or if the company is unable to adapt the business to meet industry needs  the company will continue to rely on lines of credit for its operating cash needs  or for any acquisitions 
if the lines of credit are insufficient to meet operating cash requirements  or if the ability to borrow under the lines of credit becomes restricted in any way  the company will be unable to meet day to day cash needs for the business 
the inability to meet day to day cash requirements for the business will adversely affect the company s business or financial results 
losses 
the results are principally attributable to the following factors a decline in orders from pg s largest customers and continuing operating losses of zecal 
as a result of these factors  the company incurred a  loss after taxes for dependence on customers 
a large percentage approximately of sales comes from two customers 
the company does not have long term contracts with any of these large customers 
efforts are being made to diversify the product lines and to reduce customer concentration through the addition of new customers and acquisitions 
however  sales to a few large customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenues 
the company has lost nec as a customer  and could lose other customers and the loss of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
also  economic and other conditions may cause customers to cancel  reduce or delay orders 
acquisition integration 
the company s electronics business operations consist of pg  solder and zecal 
the company acquired all of these businesses within the past three years 
the businesses acquired have different cultures  procedures and organizational structures 
the company expects future acquisitions to have the same kinds of differences 
the company may have difficulties managing growth if it integrates new operations  adds customers and expands 
failure to manage growth  or to control expenses related to growth  may materially affect the business and financial results 
leverage  access to financing 
the company is highly leveraged  must maintain certain minimum ratios  and is prohibited from taking certain actions  under existing credit arrangements 
throughout  the company was unable to meet minimum ratios and other financial covenants required under existing credit agreements 
as a result  the company sought and received a waiver from lsnb for such covenants 
in november  we received notification from wfbc demanding payment in full by march  of all obligations due 
management has been seeking financing sources for pg 
the high level of debt  or the restrictions imposed by the debt  may adversely effect financial results or the company s ability to operate its business  including making future acquisitions 
any future acquisition is expected to require additional financing 
the company may not be able to find additional financing sufficient to make any or all of the desired acquisitions 
even if financing is obtained  the terms may be less favorable than the current financing terms 
the inability to borrow additional money  or to borrow on terms as favorable as the current terms may adversely effect the business and financial results 
in addition  if the company continues to experience the current market trends or negative operating results  it may continue to fail to comply with financial covenants under the existing credit agreements 
the company may not be able to obtain waivers from its lenders for future non compliance with the credit agreements  and may lose the existing financing as a result 
any loss or reductions of the existing financing would adversely affect the business and financial results 
dependence on key employees and management 
the company has realigned its management structure so that it does not rely significantly on any one individual 
however  the loss of key employees may adversely affect the short term business or financial results 
dependence on computer industry 
the company provides products and services principally to the computer segment of the electronics manufacturing industry 
the focus is on the high margin segments in the electronic manufacturing and printed circuit board industries 
a decline in demand for these products or services will adversely affect the business or financial results 
new products and services are being developed and the company is pursuing acquisitions  to diversify business beyond the computer segment of the electronic manufacturing industry  to keep up with the pace of change in the computer industry and to grow and diversify the business 
failure to successfully develop new products and services demanded by the industry may adversely affect the business and financial results 
proprietary rights 
zecal has patented technology for the plating of copper circuits on a ceramic substrate and has non patented trade secrets relating to z strate r and devices manufactured with z strate r as well 
the z strate r patents are licensed to another company  zecal does not receive any payments from this license 
competition 
the electronic manufacturing business is very competitive 
many customers are sensitive to prices and also demand high quality products using the most advanced technologies 
if a competitor offers a superior product or service  it will adversely affect the company s ability to compete in the industry 
competitors may have superior resources  research and development and other capabilities 
any advantage a competitor has may adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
also  customers could vertically integrate or otherwise decide to compete with the company 
zecal s z strate r patents are licensed to a competitor 
new products and technological change 
the company s customers compete in markets with rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuously improving products and services 
these characteristics create short product life cycles 
the company s success depends upon its customers ability to develop and market new products successfully in this changing environment 
in addition  the company s success depends on its ability to provide products and services that customers need to develop and market new products 
if efforts and strategies to create and sell new products and services and to enter new markets fail to keep up with constantly changing technology  or if customers fail to develop successful new products and services  it may adversely affect the company s financial efforts 
fluctuations in results 
the company s operations and financial results can fluctuate significantly due to the level and timing of customer orders 
the company s results may also vary due to product life cycle changes and acquisition activities 
future performance and profitability are difficult to predict because of these fluctuations 
variations in results could result in the company having insufficient cash to pay for expected operating expenses  debt amortization payments  or capital expenditures 
real estate business economic  and other conditions generally 
global  national and local conditions and events affect the real estate industry 
the industry is also highly cyclical 
developers face many uncontrollable risks 
the real estate market  demographics  weather  government interference  unexpected increases in expenses and availability and cost of land  materials and labor may adversely affect the partnerships business or financial results 
any negative impact on the partnerships may materially effect our financial results 
leverage 
the partnerships are highly leveraged 
the partnerships borrowings at december  were  under credit arrangements for existing indebtedness  the partnerships must maintain certain minimum ratios  and are prohibited from taking certain actions 
the restrictions imposed by the partnerships existing debt  may adversely affect the partnerships financial results and ability to operate  which would have a material effect on our financial results 
access to financing 
the real estate business is capital intensive and requires expenditures for land and infrastructure development  housing construction and working capital 
funds currently available to the partnerships may not be sufficient to fund future needs 
accordingly  the partnerships expect to borrow additional money to fund their activities 
the partnerships may need additional funding in the form of equity or debt financing 
additional funding may be unavailable on terms favorable to the partnerships  or at all 
if the partnerships are not successful in funding the implementation of their business strategy and other expenditures  they may delay or abandon development projects 
delay or abandonment of development projects may adversely affect our business or financial results 
period to period fluctuations 
the partnerships real estate projects are long term in nature 
sales activity varies from period to period 
the ultimate success of any development cannot be determined from short term results 
short term results are unpredictable 
the timing and amount of revenue varies considerably from period to period 
if the partnerships fail to manage their cash flows effectively  it may adversely affect our financial results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates because portions of the company s outstanding indebtedness are at variable rates 
the company has approximately  of long term debt at variable rates based on the prime interest rate 
for every change in the prime rate  the company s annual interest rate would change by approximately  based on the outstanding indebtedness as of december  the company has approximately  of long term debt at a fixed rate of and  of long term debt at a fixed rate of 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on this fixed rate debt because market rates may decrease  which would be unfavorable to the company 
the company does not have any other financial instruments for which there is a significant exposure to interest rate changes
