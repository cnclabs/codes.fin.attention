these comparative changes in average deposits and borrowed funds include the effects of the merger with kings river  discussed earlier 
in  average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  from million for interest income in was million  an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in interest income was the result of volume increases in investment securities and loans partially as a result of the kings river acquisition and an increased rate environment

the increase was partially caused by a higher rate environment and the addition of interest expense from kings river 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from in to in net interest income was million for  which represented an increase from the prior year of million  or 
the net interest spread percentage  which represents the difference between the rate earned on average interest earning assets and the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities  decreased to for the year ending december   compared to in the decrease in net interest spread is due to the large increase in short term borrowed funds as well as the addition of the trust preferred debt in a period of rising interest rates 
net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets  or the net interest margin  decreased to in compared to in the decrease in net interest margin is primarily attributable to a shift to higher cost liabilities

the cost of total interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from in to in net interest income  as a percent of earning assets  fell from in to in a lower interest rate environment  the shift in the deposit mix towards the higher interest bearing categories and the issuance of the capital securities  offset by the relatively greater increases in interest earning assets than in interest bearing liabilities were the primary reasons for the comparative decrease in yield for both the net interest spread and the net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of changes attributable to changes in average balances volume or changes in average interest rates 
the variances attributable to both balance and rate changes have been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each category

non accrual loans include loans that are past due days or more as to principal or interest  or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collectibility 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income in the current period 
interest collections on non accrual loans are generally credited to interest income when received 
however  if ultimate collectibility of principal is in doubt  interest collections are applied as principal reductions 
interest accruals cease on commercial  mortgage and consumer loans  excluding home equity loans  when they are days past due 
at that time  previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against income 
these loans are charged off when they are days past due

as a percent of total loans  the allowance was at year end and 
at year end at year end  the allowance was million or 
of total loans 
management believes the allowance at december   was adequate based on present economic conditions and its ongoing evaluation of the risks inherent in the subsidiary banks loan portfolios 
although the subsidiary banks seek to avoid concentrations of loans to a single industry or based upon a single class of collateral  real estate and agricultural associated businesses are among the principal industries in the subsidiary banks market areas 
as a result  the subsidiary banks loan and collateral portfolios are  to some degree  concentrated in those industries 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses the company considers the special risks involved in agriculture because the agriculturally related loans in the imperial  coachella and central valleys are dependent upon the success of their agricultural businesses 
these risks include fluctuations in commodity prices which do not necessarily match the general rate of inflation  dependence of the agricultural community on the export market and the adverse impact which the dollar s strength against other currencies has had on such exports  variability of production costs  weather and climatic changes  and the fact that  in any downturn in the economy  agriculture is usually one of the last sectors of the economy to recover 
furthermore  agricultural businesses are extremely sensitive to actions of governmental agencies regarding price supports  subsidies and import or export policies  the impact of which cannot be predicted 
the subsidiary banks have an established standard process for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in addition to reviewing the inherent risks of their respective loan portfolios  consideration is given to exposures such as economic conditions  credit concentrations  collateral coverage  the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in delinquencies 
specific allocations are identified by individual loans with general allocations assigned to the various loan categories 
loans classified by the subsidiary bank s internal review or by the regulatory authorities are included in the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
this process seeks to maintain an allowance level adequate to provide for potential losses 
the provision for credit losses was million in and million in the provision expense in was million 
net charge offs were million  or 
of average loans  in as compared to million or  in in net charge offs were million  or 
of average loans 
net charge offs are projected to be million in based upon the known risks in the subsidiary bank portfolios as well as historical trends  of the projected net charge offs are anticipated to be commercial and agricultural  are anticipated to be real estate construction loans  and are anticipated to be installment loans to individuals 
at december   the subsidiary bank loan portfolios were not subject to any known significant risks except the non performing loans previously identified 
the company s subsidiary bank loan portfolios at december  did not have any outstandings in international loans and  accordingly  did not have any direct risk associated with currency fluctuations in mexico

the increase in tax expense was primarily attributable to both the acquisition of kings river and to an increase in the company s effective tax rate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate increase was primarily the result of increases in non deductible intangible asset amortization and a general increase in operating income at marginal rates 
income tax expense for the year ending december  was million as compared with million for  a decrease of 
million  or 
the decrease in tax expense was primarily attributed to a decrease in the company s effective tax rate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate decrease was primarily the result of a million increase in non taxable income from municipal securities  partially offset by increases in non deductible intangible asset amortization and non deductible merger and related non recurring expenses

under regulatory guidelines  capital adequacy is measured as a percentage of risk adjusted assets in which risk percentages are applied to assets on as well as off the balance sheet 
at december   the tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  the current minimum regulatory guidelines for tier i and total risk based capital ratios are and  respectively 
the leverage ratio  which is a measure of average tier i capital to adjusted average assets was at december   compared to at year end the leverage ratio at december  was 
the company s leverage ratio exceeds the current regulatory minimum of 
the company s capital ratios exceed all regulatory minimums and support future planned growth  but may not be adequate to support additional acquisitions 
liquidity and liability management the company s consolidated liquidity position remains adequate to meet future contingencies 
at december  the company had million in net federal funds purchased and fhlb advances outstanding 
this compared to million in net federal funds outstanding at december  since december   net federal funds purchased and fhlb advances have decreased million 
the company s consolidated liquidity ratio at december  was 
this ratio represented a decrease from at december  the company and its subsidiary banks asset liability committees alco function is to oversee the maintenance of liquidity and the preservation of net interest income when subjected to fluctuations in market interest rates 
the ability to meet existing and future funding commitments is the measure of liquidity 
liquidity is also required to meet borrowing needs  deposit withdrawals and asset growth 
the company and its subsidiaries develop liquidity through deposit growth  maturities and repayments of loans and investments  net interest income  fee income and access to purchase funds through correspondent banks or other entities 
the alco s manage the interest rate sensitivity or repricing characteristics of their respective assets and liabilities 
the primary source of earnings for the subsidiaries is net interest income  which is subject to movements in interest rates 
to minimize the effect of changes in rates  the balance sheet requires structuring in order that the repricing opportunities for both assets and liabilities exist in nearly equivalent amounts and at approximately similar time intervals 
interval differences may exist at times creating interest sensitivity gaps  which represent the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
these gaps are static in nature and do not consider future activity 
as such  these gap measurements serve best as an indicator for potential interest rate exposure 
the sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations is measured in several time frames 
various strategies such as liability cost administration and redeployment of asset maturities are utilized to preserve interest income from the effect of changes in interest rates 
the gap positions are monitored as a function of the asset and liability management process 
the monitoring process includes the use of periodic simulated business forecasts  which incorporate various interest rate environments 
financial modeling is utilized to assist management in maintaining consistent earnings in an environment of changing interest rates 
the following table sets forth the relative maturities of the commercial  agricultural and construction loan portfolios and provides a breakout relative to fixed and variable rate loan maturities over one year but less one year than over or less five years five years total loans s commercial and agricultural     real estate construction     real estate other     consumer     total     loans with predetermined fixed interest rates     loans with variable floating interest rates     total     the following schedule sets forth the maturities of time certificates of deposit over  and their relative mix balance percent s of total less than three months  three months through six months  seven months through twelve months  over twelve months  total  the company s subsidiaries do not maintain trading accounts for any class of financial instrument nor do they engage in hedging activities or purchase high risk derivative instruments 
furthermore  the subsidiaries are not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
in addition to gap measurement  the alco s are further responsible for the measurement of interest rate risk  ie  the risk of loss in value due to changes in interest rates 
the alco s monitor and consider methods of managing interest rate risk by monitoring changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the alco s attempt to manage the various components of their respective balance sheets to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company and its subsidiaries exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a periodic basis by their respective boards of directors and alco 
if potential changes to npv and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate swings are not within the limits established by the board  the board may direct management to adjust its assets and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
the company and its subsidiary banks utilize interest rate sensitivity analysis to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in npv of cash flows from assets and liabilities within a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market rate sensitive instruments in the event of sudden and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates ranging from one hundred to three hundred basis points 
the company and its subsidiary banks boards of directors have adopted interest rate risk policies  which establish a maximum limit of decrease in the npv in the event of sudden and sustained increases  and decreases in market interest rates 
the following tables present the company s projected changes in npv and net interest income for the various rate shock levels as of december  change in net portfolio value at december  net portfolio actual percentage change in interest rates value s change s change basis point rise   basis point rise   basis point rise   base rate scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline   basis point decline   change in net interest income at december  net interest actual percentage change in interest rates income s change s change basis point rise  basis point rise  basis point rise  base rate scenario  basis point decline  basis point decline   basis point decline   certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods within which they will reprice  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
there may also be repayment risk if interest rates rise on loans 
computation of forecasted effects of hypothetical interest rate changes should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to change in interest rates 
the company is a legal entity  separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
although there exists the ability to raise capital on its own behalf such as the recent private placement of trust preferred securities or borrow from external sources  the company may obtain additional funds through dividends paid by  and fees for services provided to  its subsidiaries 
regulations limit the amount of dividends as well as service fees paid by subsidiaries 
the company s expenses have been primarily covered by fees charged to and dividends received from vib and it is anticipated that the company will be able to continue to rely on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its separate operations and obligations 
the company may not always be able to rely solely on its current or future subsidiaries to meet its obligations  including obligations under the trust preferred securities  or to maintain its separate liquidity 
under such circumstances  the company would be forced to seek other means to raise capital 
at december  the company had adequate liquidity to meet its anticipated funding needs 
inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on an industrial concern  primarily because its assets and liabilities consist largely of monetary items 
the relatively low proportion of the company s fixed assets to total assets of at december   and at december   reduces both the potential for inflated earnings resulting from understated depreciation changes  and the potential for significant understatement of absolute asset values 
however  financial institutions are affected by inflation s impact on non interest expenses  such as salaries and occupancy expense  and to some extent  by inflative impact on interest rates
