item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition at december   the company was affected by a change in its method of accounting for revenue recognition for leasing transactions in compliance with sab this change was adopted as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  effective as of january  approximately million in previously recognized leasing commissions were removed as a result of this accounting change 
such leasing commissions will be realized in the future upon the fulfillment of conditions to commission payment 
the company s total assets increased by approximately million to million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the following items i a million increase in cash attributable to the record transaction levels in the commercial services businesses in combination with million of life insurance proceeds  ii investment in property and equipment and real estate interests  and iii a million increase in deferred tax assets 
conversely  assets were lowered by a million decline in receivables  which is the net effect of a million increase in uncollected commissions on executed lease transactions and the reduction of approximately million in commissions receivables eliminated by sab in addition  the company s total assets included costs in excess of net assets of acquired businesses of million and million at december  and  respectively  resulting from business acquisitions substantially comprised of goodwill 
liabilities increased by approximately million to million at december  this reflects a million increase in accrued incentives resulting from exceptional operating performance  a million increase in acquisition payables related to the full achievement of all remaining uk purchase consideration payable in march  borrowings of million on available credit facilities and approximately million of borrowings on real estate mortgage notes principally to fund internet initiatives and real estate development activities

results of operations accounting change the company s financial results for were affected by the change in its method of accounting for revenue recognition for leasing commissions in compliance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the adoption of sab is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  under sab  the company s leasing commissions that are payable upon certain events such as tenant occupancy or payment of rent will be recognized upon the occurrence of such events 
historically  insignia generally recognized leasing commissions upon execution of the underlying lease  unless significant contingencies existed

the effect of retroactive application of the accounting change to january  lowered service revenues by million  net ebitda by million and income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change by million  or per share  for the year 
on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the change retroactive to january   the company would have reported service revenues of million  net ebitda of million  and net income of million for the year 
actual results reported for included service revenues of million  net ebitda of million and net income of million

s 
and european commercial real estate services operations and full year contributions from douglas elliman acquired in june and st 
quintin acquired in march

these results were achieved despite the lowering effects of the sab accounting change on certain leasing transactions 
the company s net earnings for were favorably impacted by income of million from life insurance proceeds and million in foreign currency transaction gains  principally from facility borrowings in declining european currencies 
conversely  income for was adversely affected by pre tax internet losses totaling million and including million in impairment write downs of the company s internally developed businesses and certain third party investments

as a result of the foregoing  the company reported income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million for  representing a significant increase of over million for on a per share basis  such earnings represented for compared to for the company reported a net loss of million for  after the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect lowered earnings per share by to for the year 
the comparative results for the year were marked by the first quarter shortage of brokerage transactions in the aftermath of the late capital markets turmoil and the million million net of tax benefit provision for merger related expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of st 
quintin and its merger with regl 
weighted average fully diluted common shares increased for due to the assumed conversion of convertible preferred stock issued in february  along with the additional dilutive effect of assumed stock option and warrant exercises resulting from a rise in the company s stock price during the year

such internal operating costs were net of a realized gain of  from the sale of stock in homestore 
com and interest income of  earned on cash holdings of edificerex prior to its de consolidation 
the company s internet initiatives have been a disappointment  primarily due to adverse market conditions during the second half of that resulted in the evaporation of equity financing for internet technology initiatives 
therefore  the company has substantially ceased financing of internal and third party internet businesses and does not expect to invest materially in internet technology initiatives  other than certain internet related platforms developed or invested in by project octane 
a driving force behind this decision was the company s desire to eliminate all on going exposure to the financial requirements associated with such internet based initiatives 
at december   insignia held remaining equity investments of approximately million after approximately million of impairment write offs in third party internet related businesses 
insignia s equity ownership in these businesses ranges from to 
while these businesses continue to operate  their future performance is highly dependent upon the ability to raise incremental capital to fund the on going development of their business plans 
if they are unsuccessful in raising the necessary capital  insignia could incur further losses from impairment write offs

in comparison  foreign currency gains totaled  for the year

quintin and douglas elliman and further borrowings of million in to finance internet initiatives 
depreciation and amortization of intangibles from real estate service operations excluding property operations and internet based businesses increased  in the aggregate  from million in to million in this increase is the result of substantial capital investments in property and equipment see also liquidity and capital resources and the full year impact of purchased intangible amortization for the acquisitions of st 
quintin and douglas elliman 
the comparative results for the year were adversely affected by the million million net of tax benefit non recurring charge for merger related expenses in connection with the march acquisition of st 
quintin and its subsequent combination with regl 
the one time charge was substantially composed of the costs to vacate excess office space and  to a lesser extent  corresponding severance costs

all excess office space was subleased and severance costs were incurred prior to december  also  certain excess office space was subleased on more favorable terms than originally estimated  resulting in a million pre tax income credit in the fourth quarter of income taxes for declined compared to  despite higher income  due primarily to the non taxable nature of the previously mentioned income of million from life insurance proceeds

realty one reported an ebitda decline of to million in this decrease reflected the effects of the year over year decline in first quarter results attributable to the reversion to a more normal seasonal sales pattern in compared to the record level experienced in the first quarter of and the impact of rising interest rates on sales volume 
insignia residential group reported an ebitda decline of from  in to  in as a result of higher lease expense and support costs  compared to real estate principal investment activities the commercial operations of insignia esg also included the property operations of the three wholly owned real estate properties that were consolidated in the company s financial statements for these properties produced revenues and pre tax losses of approximately million and  respectively 
the results of operations for these properties were excluded from service ebitda and included in ffo from real estate operations

interest expense increased by million over levels to million for the year 
the increase was due principally to interest charges on credit facility borrowings of approximately million to finance the acquisitions of lynch murphy  st 
quintin and douglas elliman 
interest expense for was attributable solely to asset financing consisting of realty one borrowings  principally under its warehouse line used in the origination of mortgage loans for sale  and regl borrowings substantially secured by restricted cash deposits 
the results for do not include any interest expense allocation from the indebtedness of former parent 
depreciation and amortization of intangibles exclusive of property operations increased from million in to million in these increases were the result of increased capital investments in property and equipment and acquisitions substantially comprised of purchased intangibles 
results for were adversely affected by the million million net of tax benefit non recurring charge for merger related expenses in connection with the march acquisition of st 
quintin and its subsequent combination with regl 
as previously noted  the one time charge was substantially composed of the costs to vacate excess office space and  to a lesser extent  corresponding severance costs 
the one time charge included provisions for rent expense during the period from vacancy to sublease  costs of improvements required for sublease  free rent concessions  excess rent over sublease terms and severance 
all excess office space was subleased and severance costs were incurred prior to december  also  certain excess office space was subleased on more favorable terms than originally estimated  resulting in a million pre tax income credit in the fourth quarter of earnings for were adversely affected by the one time impairment charge of million for the write down of the company s investment in its italian subsidiary  insignia cagisa  to the then estimated disposition value of approximately million 
the company completed the disposition of its interest in this subsidiary in march  realizing a gain of approximately  income taxes declined to million in  in comparison to  as a result of lower income 
liquidity and capital resources insignia s liquidity and capital resources consist of its unrestricted cash on hand  available credit under its million revolving credit facility and cash provided by operations 
the company utilizes cash holdings and available credit for general corporate purposes  expansion of the service platform through acquisitions and office openings and to fund ongoing real estate investment activities 
unrestricted cash at december  totaled approximately million 
however  in march  a substantial portion of this cash is to be used for payment of approximately million in incentive compensation and million for remaining purchase consideration for the uk operation 
the company s total debt at december  and consisted of the following in thousands credit facility borrowings   notes payable to sellers of acquired businesses  secured by restricted cash holdings   other debt of subsidiaries   notes payable   mortgage warehouse line of credit   real estate mortgage notes payable   total debt   the real estate mortgages  mortgage warehouse line and cash secured acquisition indebtedness are all self liquidating from the related assets and do not affect insignia s liquidity and capital resources 
other debt of million  together with approximately million in letters of credit supporting real estate investments  represent the outstanding obligations under facilities aggregating approximately million 
approximately million in unused credit was available at december  insignia believes that its cash on hand  available credit and anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient for its short term and long term operating and capital requirements 
for  insignia has budgeted approximately million in capital expenditures  has a range of million allocated for potential acquisitions or geographic expansions and expects to allocate up to million to real estate activities 
with million in credit available and in excess of million in cash from operations expected in  no further external capital is anticipated 
the million revolving credit facility matures in october insignia has commenced the process to renew this facility for another three years and expects to complete the renewal process during the second quarter of during  cash provided by operations of approximately million which included million of non recurring life insurance proceeds was supplemented by million borrowed under insignia s credit facility  million from a private placement of preferred stock and more than million in proceeds from employee stock purchases 
the principal uses of this cash were internet investments of approximately million  capital expenditures of more than million  acquisition payments of million and net real estate investments of approximately million 
the remainder is included in cash at december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective as of january  for the company and its implementation will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of operations of insignia in recent years and is not anticipated to have a significant negative impact in the foreseeable future 
insignia s exposure to market risk from changing prices consists primarily of fluctuations in rental rates of properties managed  market interest rates on residential mortgages and debt obligations  real estate property values and foreign currency fluctuations of its european operations 
the revenues associated with the commercial services business are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates  lease rates  real property values and the availability of space and competition in the market place 
commercial service revenues are derived from a broad range of services that are primarily transaction driven and are therefore volatile in nature and highly competitive 
the revenues of the property management operations with respect to rental properties are highly dependent upon the aggregate rents of the properties managed  which are affected by rental rates and building occupancy rates 
rental rate increases are dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environments in the respective locations of the properties 
employee compensation is the principal cost element of property management 
changes in market interest rates on residential mortgage loans and changes in real property values in northern ohio and new york city impact the revenues of the company s residential brokerage and mortgage origination businesses 
increases in mortgage interest rates during  which resulted in a weak environment for single family home sales in the northern ohio marketplace  adversely affected the revenues and profits of realty one s home brokerage and mortgage origination business 
consequently  realty one reported year over year declines in revenue and ebitda of million and million  respectively  for the year compared to nature of operations revenues from tenant representation  investment sales  debt placements  agency leasing and residential brokerage  which collectively comprise a substantial portion of insignia s service revenues  are transactional in nature and therefore subject to seasonality and business and capital market conditions 
such seasonal and other factors materially impact the company s quarterly results  particularly revenues  earnings and cash flows 
consistent with the industry in general  the commercial services segment has historically experienced its lowest quarterly operating results in the first quarter of each year as a result of the desire of clients to complete transactions by calendar year end 
this phenomenon generally results in higher revenues and income in the last half of the year and a gradual slowdown in transactional activity and corresponding operating results during the first quarter 
the sab accounting change may affect seasonality 
the residential services segment is materially impacted by the seasonal factors of realty one s home brokerage and mortgage origination business 
due to the geographic location of realty one s operations in ohio  weather conditions have historically had an adverse effect on single family home sales resulting in operating losses during the first quarter of each year 
the volume of realty one s home brokerage and mortgage transactions typically peak during the spring and summer months  coinciding with both favorable weather conditions and the increased tendency for moving between school years  resulting in higher revenues and earnings during the second and third quarters of each year 
a significant portion of the expenses associated with transactional activities in the commercial and residential segments is directly correlated to revenue 
as a consequence of the seasonality of revenues  the company s income is normally expected to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
insignia continues to believes that its large  diversified client base  geographical reach  overall size and number of annual transactions help to minimize the impact of seasonality and other changes in business and capital market conditions on annual revenues and earnings
