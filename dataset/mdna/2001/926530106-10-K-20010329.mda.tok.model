item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of vidamed s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with vidamed s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements presented at the beginning of part i of this form k and certain important factors at the end of this section 
overview since our founding in  we have been engaged in the design  development and marketing of urological systems used to treat the enlarged prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia  commonly referred to as bph 
we commenced international sales of our patented tuna system in late  and in october  after receiving fda clearance  we began marketing and selling the tuna system to office based urology practices in the us  assuming that after receiving fda clearance  third party reimbursement  including medicare  would be approved for those locations 
in mid  medicare announced that approval of any new office based or ambulatory surgery center procedures would be delayed until at least mid due to year compliance issues 
as a result  medicare reimbursement for the tuna procedure was made available only for procedures performed in hospital based settings  on a reasonable cost basis  and required individual state by state approval 
starting in late and through  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on obtaining the required individual state medicare reimbursement approvals and implementing a new us hospital based fee per use sales and marketing model 
as of march   states had approved hospital based medicare reimbursement coverage for the tuna procedure 
under the reasonable cost basis method of reimbursement  we charged the hospital a fee per use charge of approximately  for each tuna procedure performed  and combined with other direct and indirect overhead costs the hospital incurs in conducting the tuna procedure  the hospital was reimbursed by medicare for these reasonable costs 
in addition to the hospital  the urologist that performs the tuna procedure was reimbursed by medicare approximately per procedure 
in august the us health care financing administration  or hcfa  which administers medicare reimbursement  replaced the reasonable cost basis reimbursement for outpatient hospital based procedures  like the tuna procedure  with a new fixed rate or prospective payment system 
under this new method of reimbursement  a hospital receives a fixed reimbursement of approximately  for each tuna procedure performed in its facility  although this rate can be higher or lower depending on a wage index factor for each hospital 
the urologist performing the tuna procedure continues to be reimbursed approximately per procedure 
with this change in reimbursement  we continue to market and sell the tuna procedure to hospitals on a fee per use basis  but our fee per use pricing has been reduced 
in july  hcfa published new medicare payment rates and a schedule for implementing minimally invasive heat therapies for the treatment of bph in the urologist s office 
coverage of the tuna procedure was included in the ruling  which became effective in january the approximate reimbursement rate inclusive of physician s fee for the tuna procedure in the urologist s office is  in and  in we anticipate that the demand for the tuna procedure will increase as we expand the tuna treatment from the outpatient hospital setting to the convenience and control of physicians offices 
our goal is to establish the tuna system as a global standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is to continue to support our existing hospital based customers  aggressively promote our product to the physician office based market and focus our marketing and sales efforts on patient education and physician support 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses through the end of the year as we expend funds on marketing and sales activities  clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  and research and development 
our future profitability will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving market acceptance of the tuna procedure in the physician s office  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the extent to which medicare and other healthcare payors continue to reimburse costs of the tuna procedures performed in hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers and physicians offices and the amount of reimbursement provided 
results of operations revenues 
net revenues for increased million  or  to million in  over net revenues of million 
this was the direct result of a increase in us disposable cartridge sales from  units in to  units in this was primarily due to the strength of our us hospital based fee per use program where disposable cartridge sales increased to  units in from units in the volume increase in the us was offset by the procedure price reduction which became effective on august   with the implementation of hcfa s new prospective payment system 
worldwide disposable cartridge sales increased by  from  in to  in net revenues for increased million or nearly five times over revenues of million 
in  we recognized sales reserves of million to adjust for the impact of a delay in office based medicare reimbursement 
cost of sales and gross margins 
cost of product sold increased to million in from million in  due primarily to higher product sales resulting from our fee per use sales model 
cost of product sold decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to the implementation of our fee per use sales model and the increased unit sales of disposable cartridges versus higher cost generators 
due to increased fee per use sales in the united states  we continued to recognize significant increases in gross margin in under the fee per use program  we place the tuna capital equipment with hospitals at no charge and sell single use cartridges for each tuna procedure performed 
we amortize the cost of the tuna equipment to cost of sales and recognize the cost of each cartridge upon shipment 
gross profit was million or of revenues 
gross profit was million or of revenues 
gross profit in was a negative million 
as a result of low volume and after adjusting for the million in sales reserves recorded in  required because of medicare s delay in approving reimbursement for the tuna procedure  gross profit was million or of adjusted revenues of million 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  and down from million in research and development expenditures in increased slightly from as we prepared for the launch of our next generation physician office product 
the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to reduced clinical activity in  resulting from the completion of fda clinical trial studies and the completion of research and development expenditures for our provu tuna system in research and development expenses include expenditures for regulatory compliance and clinical trials 
clinical trial costs consist largely of payments to clinical investigators  product for clinical trials  and costs associated with initiating and monitoring clinical trials 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and down from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative costs in was a result of expenditures in sales training and sales tools in anticipation of the opening of the physician office market 
the higher selling  general and administrative costs in compared to were due primarily to a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts  which was in addition to the million sales reserve  necessitated by the length of time involved in obtaining medicare coverage  a charge incurred in the transition to a new chief executive officer  and non routine legal expenses related to patent defense 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the level of interest income is directly related to the average level of cash  cash equivalents  and other investment balances and the rate of interest earned thereon 
interest and other expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in was due to the reduced balance of our equipment term loan during the year 
total comprehensive loss 
total comprehensive loss for was  compared to a net loss of  total comprehensive loss and net loss for was  total comprehensive loss and net loss for was  for the year  the difference between total comprehensive loss and net loss was a result of two factors 
in august  we received  shares of common stock in rita medical systems  inc  a then private company  pursuant to a cross licensing agreement 
at the time of the agreement  the value of the common stock was assigned a value equal to our basis in the licensed technology  which was essentially zero 
in july  rita successfully completed an initial public offering of its common stock 
as a result  we are now accounting for the investment as a short term investment and have recorded the security at its fair market value of  resulting in an unrealized gain during in the same amount 
additionally  the ability to sell the common stock in rita medical systems was restricted by a lockup period  which expired january at december   we had available for sale securities  consisting of commercial paper and corporate bonds with maturities of greater than ninety days and less than one year  that had unrealized gains of  income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carry forwards of approximately   and  respectively 
additionally  we had foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  the federal net operating loss carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
the california net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change rules provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses before utilization 
fluctuation in operating results 
our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future from year to year as well as from quarter to quarter 
revenues may fluctuate as a result of actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters and the extent to which the tuna system gains market acceptance 
operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of several factors  including 
the timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  
costs of clinical activities  and 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the potential growth of our organization 
fluctuations in our operating results could have a material adverse affect on our business by  among other things  disrupting our cash flow  limiting our ability to attract investors  and impairing our ability to implement long range plans 
as a result  there can be no assurance as to when or whether we will achieve profitability 
if profitability is achieved  there can be no assurance such profitability will continue in the future 
liquidity and capital resources as we began fiscal  we believed that our current cash balances  projected cash flows from operations  including our fee per use program  and cash available under our transamerica financing facility would be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements through the end of reduced pricing resulting from the implementation of the prospective payment system by hcfa  which became effective in august  and additional sales and marketing costs incurred in connection with the anticipation of physician office reimbursement becoming effective in january  required us to obtain additional financing in to meet our operating and capital requirements 
in november  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for per share  or an aggregate of  to accredited investors  including several existing stockholders 
we have debt financing with transamerica technology finance  a division of transamerica corporation 
this facility is secured by our assets and consists of a revolving accounts receivable based credit line of up to million and a million equipment term loan 
the term loan was funded in full as of december   at an interest rate of per year 
repayment of that loan is amortized over a three year period  with the first monthly payment having been made in december as of december   we owed  on this equipment term loan 
as of december   we borrowed approximately  against the revolving accounts receivable based line at a rate of per year 
the revolving credit line has a minimum interest payment of  per year 
upon initiation of this financing  transamerica received a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in october  we entered into an amendment and waiver agreement with transamerica 
under that agreement  transamerica waived an event of default under our loan and security agreement resulting from the inclusion of a going concern uncertainty paragraph in an updated opinion from our independent auditors regarding our fiscal financial statements 
in consideration for the waiver  we paid transamerica a  fee and issued it a warrant to acquire to  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of per share 
in january  we renewed our debt financing with transamerica and in consideration of this renewal paid a  fee and issued a warrant to acquire an additional  shares of common stock for a purchase price of per share 
in january  our debt financing with transamerica automatically renewed 
management believes that the proceeds of our november equity financing together with existing cash and anticipated revenues from both the existing hospital and the new physicians office market  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels through the end of year recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which is required to be adopted for the year ending december  management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our operating results or financial position 
in december  the sec issued sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
in october  the sec issued a frequently asked questions document on sab to provide further definitive guidance on its implementation 
sab is effective for years beginning after december  and was required adopted by us in the quarter ended december   retroactive to the beginning of the year 
sab did not have a significant effect on our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies certain elements of apb opinion no 
 including the definition of employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as non compensatory  the accounting consequences of whether modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that have occurred after either december  or january  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our operating results  financial position or cash flows in the year ended december certain important factors in addition to the factors identified above  there are several important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by us or which are reflected in any of our forward looking statements 
these factors  and their impact on the success of our operations and our ability to achieve our goals  include the following we have incurred substantial losses since our inception  and if physicians do not purchase and use our tuna system and the related disposables in sufficient quantities  we may be unable to achieve and maintain profitability 
we incurred a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   and have incurred substantial losses since our inception from costs relating to the development and commercialization of our tuna system 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near future as we expend funds on sales and marketing activities  clinical trials in support of reimbursement approvals and research and development 
our future profitability depends upon our ability to sell sufficient quantities of our tuna system and the related disposables to generate revenue in excess of our planned expenditures 
our ability to sell sufficient quantities of our tuna system and the related disposables depends upon numerous factors  including 
our success in achieving market acceptance of the tuna system  
our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances and approvals  
the extent to which medicare and other healthcare payors continue to reimburse the costs of tuna procedures and the amounts of reimbursement provided  and 
our success in expanding our sales and marketing efforts to sell the tuna system into urologists offices 
we depend upon our tuna system  which is our only product  for all of our revenues 
all of our revenues are derived from sales of our tuna system 
as a result  our success is solely dependent upon the success of our tuna system 
we began selling the tuna system in late to date  our tuna system has not received widespread market acceptance 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our tuna system  such as competition or technological change  would significantly harm our business 
our tuna system consists of a radio frequency generator  a reusable handle  a disposable cartridge and an optical telescope 
if a material problem develops with any one or more of those components  our revenues would suffer 
possible problems that we may experience with our tuna system include 
malfunctions  
failure to comply with or changes in governmental regulations  
product recalls  
product obsolescence  
patent infringement claims  
inability to protect our intellectual property  and 
shortages of one or more of the components of the system 
we outsource almost all of our manufacturing and rely upon several single source suppliers to manufacture two of the four major components to our tuna system 
the termination of these relationships or the failure of these manufacturers to supply us components on a timely basis or in significant quantities would likely cause us to be unable to meet customer orders for our tuna system and harm our business 
we outsource all of our manufacturing  except for the assembly of the reusable handle 
we obtain components to the reusable handle from a number of different suppliers  including a few single source suppliers 
we are aware of a few other qualified suppliers for many of these components 
we contract with humphrey systems  a division of carl zeiss  inc  and circon corporation to manufacture the disposable cartridge  telo electronics  a subsidiary of sanmina mpd  to manufacture the radio frequency generator  and karl storz in germany to manufacture the telescope 
we have not qualified any alternative sources of supply for our radio frequency generator or telescope 
we have written agreements with humphrey systems and circon corporation to manufacture the disposable cartridge 
either party may terminate these agreements for any reason upon at least days prior written notice 
we do not have any other supply agreements with these suppliers or any of our other suppliers that require them to supply us with components to our tuna system 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  product recalls  quality control and assurance  component supply and lack of qualified personnel 
if any of our manufacturers experience production problems  we may not be able to locate an alternate manufacturer promptly 
identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers of components takes time and involves significant additional costs and may delay the production of the tuna system 
the fda requires us to identify any supplier we use 
the fda may require additional testing of any component from new suppliers prior to our use of these components 
the termination of our relationships with these single source suppliers or the failure of these parties to supply us with the components to the tuna system on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities would likely cause us to be unable to meet customer orders for our products in a timely manner or within our budget and harm our business 
the tuna procedure is a new therapy and may not be accepted by physicians  patients and healthcare payors  which would significantly harm our business 
physicians will not recommend the tuna procedure unless they conclude  based on clinical data and other factors  that it is an effective alternative to other methods of enlarged prostate treatment  including more established methods 
in particular  physicians may elect not to recommend the tuna procedure until the long term duration of the relief provided by the procedure has been established 
clinical data for assessing the durability of relief provided by the tuna therapy does not extend beyond five years 
some physicians may consider five years of clinical data to be sufficient evidence of durability and others may not 
as time passes since the first tuna procedures were performed  and as more procedures are performed  the clinical data will continue to be developed 
we are in the process of conducting multi year patient follow up studies to assess the durability of the relief provided by the tuna procedure 
we cannot assure you that these studies will support the durability of the relief provided by the tuna procedure 
even if the clinical efficacy of the tuna procedure is established  physicians may elect not to recommend the procedure unless acceptable reimbursement from healthcare payors is available 
healthcare payor acceptance of the tuna procedure will require evidence of its cost effectiveness compared with other therapies for an enlarged prostate  which will depend in large part upon the duration of the relief provided by the tuna procedure 
patient acceptance of the procedure will depend in part upon physician recommendations and on other factors  including the degree of invasiveness and the rate and severity of complications associated with the tuna procedure compared with other therapies 
patient acceptance of the tuna procedure will also depend upon the ability of physicians to educate these patients on their treatment choices 
our marketing strategy must overcome the difficulties inherent in the introduction of new technology to the medical community 
we depend upon several of our executive officers and key employees  and if we are unable to retain these individuals  our business could suffer 
our ability to grow and our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the continued contributions of our senior management and key employees  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  randy d 
lindholm  joined vidamed in many other members of our management and key employees have been with vidamed for a number of years and have extensive experience with other medical technology companies 
the success of our business is dependent upon the ability  experience and performance of these individuals and our ability to retain these individuals 
we do not have key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly qualified managerial  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  especially in the silicon valley area where our principal executive office is located 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining these personnel 
our inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  particularly managerial  technical and sales and marketing personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  which would harm our business 
there is intense competition for skilled sales and marketing employees  especially for individuals who have experience selling medical devices 
we may be unable to hire skilled individuals to sell our tuna system  which could harm our business 
if we fail to compete successfully in our market  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected and we may not achieve future growth 
although there is a large market for the treatment of men suffering from enlarged prostate  there are a number of therapies competing for market share 
competition in the market for minimally invasive devices to treat this condition is primarily two competitors  urologix  inc and johnson johnson 
both of these competitors have 
better name recognition  
more widely accepted products and broader product lines  
greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and 
more established relationships with some of our existing and potential customers 
johnson johnson also has significantly greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs and facilities than us 
our competitors will likely continue to improve their products and develop new competing products 
other competitors will likely also emerge 
we may be unable to compete effectively with our competitors if we cannot keep up with existing or new alternative products  techniques  therapies and technology in the treatment of bph market 
our competitors may commercially introduce new technologies and products that are more effective than our products or render our products obsolete 
competition in our market may also result in pricing pressures that may decrease the sales prices for our products 
if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products or if we are sued for violating the intellectual property rights of others  we may be unable to gain market share or operate our business profitably 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  copyrights  know how  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
these legal means  however  afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our patents and trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation would likely result in substantial expense and divert our attention from implementing our business strategy 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that others have not developed or will not develop similar products or manufacturing processes  duplicate any of our products or manufacturing processes  or design around any of our patents 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are aware of patents held by other participants in our market  and we cannot assure you that we will not in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings 
intellectual property litigation would likely result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us 
if we lose one of these proceedings  a court  or a similar foreign governing body  could require us to pay significant damages to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our products  or prevent us from manufacturing  using or selling our products 
in addition to being costly  protracted litigation regarding our ability to incorporate intellectual property into our products could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation 
our future revenues depend upon our customers receiving third party reimbursement 
the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability 
in the united states  given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform  including the reform of medicare and medicaid systems  and on the cost of medical products and services 
our ability to commercialize the tuna system successfully will depend in part upon the extent to which the users of our product obtain appropriate reimbursement for the cost of the tuna procedure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our excess cash in marketable securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as of december   our investments consisted of commercial paper and corporate bonds with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of greater than days and less than one year and common stock in rita medical systems  inc if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   such a change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our commercial paper and government securities portfolio as of that date 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
additionally  our ability to sell our common stock in rita medical systems was restricted by a lockup period  which expired january
