item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
in fiscal  we generated of our gross revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national spot advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network advertising  event revenue and rental income from tower sites 
we include revenues recognized under a time brokerage agreement or a similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations in net revenues  while we reflect operating expenses associated with these stations in station operating expenses 
consequently  there is no difference in the method of revenue and operating expense recognition between a station operated by us under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement and a station owned and operated by us 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase listenership and arbitron ratings 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any increased ratings and therefore increased advertising revenues tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional spending 
we calculate same station growth by comparing the performance of stations operated by us throughout the relevant period to the comparable performance in the prior year s corresponding period  adjusted for significant changes to sports contracts  excluding the effect of barter revenues and expenses 
for purposes of the following discussion  pro forma net income represents historical income before income taxes and extraordinary item adjusted as if we were treated as a c corporation during all relevant periods at an effective tax rate of  applied to income before income taxes and extraordinary item and the effect of the adjustment to reflect indexing of the convertible subordinated note the amount of this adjustment is not tax deductible 
results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
historically  we operated with an october st to september th fiscal year 
effective january   we changed for financial reporting purposes from a fiscal year ending september th to a fiscal year ending december st

the amount of the deferred pro forma income tax expense was million and million for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we use a significant portion of our capital resources to consummate acquisitions 
these acquisitions are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our bank facility described below  the sale of securities  the swapping of our radio stations in transactions which qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code  and internally generated cash flow 
our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   were heavily impacted by our acquisition of radio stations from sinclair in and operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the year ended december  and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
changes in our net cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily a result of changes in advertising revenues and station operating expenses  which are affected by the acquisition and disposition of stations during those periods 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities were positively affected primarily by the acquisition of radio stations from sinclair radio stations on december   including one station under a time brokerage agreement that we subsequently acquired in  and three radio stations on july   excluding the station we acquired from sinclair and immediately sold and other radio station acquisitions  offset by the required divestiture of two radio stations in kansas city  excluding the station we acquired from sinclair and immediately sold  and an increase in accounts receivable on acquired stations  net of the kansas city divestiture 
investing and financing activities net cash flows used by investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the year ended december  and the twelve months ended december   respectively  as a result of the net impact of acquisitions  divestitures and capital expenditures 
net cash flows used by financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of million and million for the year ended december  and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
the cash flows for the year ended december   reflect acquisitions and investments consummated and the related borrowings and the proceeds from the disposition of the kansas city stations 
the cash flows for the year ended december   reflect acquisitions consummated and the related borrowings  net proceeds from our initial public offering and the related payment of long term debt  net proceeds from our october class a common stock and tides offerings and the related payment of long term debt  and the distribution to our s corporation shareholders of million primarily from the funds available from the sale of our tampa stations 
our business generally does not require substantial investment of capital 
our capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   as compared to million and million in the year ended december  and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
despite an increase in the average number of radio stations owned throughout this year as compared to the average number of radio stations owned throughout the prior year  primarily from the acquisition of radio stations from sinclair  and despite the continued consolidation and relocation of studio facilities in certain markets  our capital expenditures declined in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
on february   upon the consummation of our initial public offering  we received net proceeds of million  after deducting expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions 
we used these proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under our former credit facility and to pay other corporate obligations 
shortly after reducing indebtedness under our former credit facility  in february we borrowed approximately million to purchase three boston radio stations from cbs 
on october   we completed our class a common stock and tides offerings and received million and million in proceeds  respectively  after deducting discounts  commissions  fees and expenses 
the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
we used the net proceeds from our october class a common stock offering and the tides offering  together with cash on hand and proceeds from our bank facility  to finance the million in cash to consummate the purchase of stations from sinclair on december  in addition to debt service and quarterly distributions under the tides  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and  if appropriate opportunities arise  acquisitions of additional radio stations 
for fiscal year  we estimate that capital expenditures will be between million and million 
the estimated amount for capital expenditures includes a million commitment as of december   to fund construction of a studio relocation 
we are also committed to fund certain strategic investments in the amount of approximately million as of december   for which we are existing equity partners 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with available revolving and term credit borrowings under our bank facility  should be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations 
however  we may require additional financing for future acquisitions  if any  and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
as of december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under our bank facility in addition to an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of million  of which most of the outstanding debt was assumed in connection with the acquisition of the radio stations from sinclair 
upon closing the sinclair acquisition on december   our effective tax rate increased from to as a result of adding stations in additional states which on average have higher income tax rates than in those states in which we were already operating 
for the year ended december   we also recorded a non cash deferred income tax expense of approximately million to reflect the increase in the effective tax rate and its effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
we entered into our bank facility  dated as of december   with a syndicate of banks for million in senior secured credit consisting of million in a reducing revolving credit facility  and million in a multi draw term loan that was fully drawn as of september  our bank facility was established to refinance our existing indebtedness  provide working capital  and fund corporate acquisitions 
at our election  interest on any outstanding principal accrues at a rate based on either libor plus a spread which ranges from to or on keybank na s base rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
although we may borrow  repay and re borrow under the revolving credit facility  the aggregate maximum amount that we can have outstanding at any one time is reduced on a quarterly basis beginning on september  in amounts that vary from million to million for each loan 
under the bank facility  the reducing revolving credit facility and multi draw term loan mature on september  our bank facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios that are defined terms within the agreement 
we believe we are in compliance with the covenants and leverage ratios 
we expect to use the credit available under the revolving credit facility to fund pending and future acquisitions 
our bank facility also provides that at any time prior to december  we may solicit additional incremental loans of up to million  and we will be governed under the same terms as the term loan 
however  there can be no guarantee that  upon request  we will receive commitments for any of the incremental loans 
the amount available under the bank facility was million as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  which are collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  will be required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated in a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recorded in other comprehensive income oci and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
sfas no 
defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as on going effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge will be marked to fair value through earnings 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
which extended the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 an amendment to sfas no 
as of january   we will record a million loss as an accumulated transition adjustment to earnings relating to derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
in addition  as of january   we will record a million loss as an accumulated transition adjustment to earnings and a million loss as an accumulated transition adjustment to oci for designated cash flow hedges 
we calculated the transition adjustment in accordance with tentative accounting guidance issued by the derivatives implementation group  and therefore  the guidance could be subject to change 
the derivatives implementation group is a committee appointed by the fasb and assigned the responsibility of answering implementation and interpretation questions related to this new accounting standard 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  sab entitled  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended  effective as of october   which summarizes the commission s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
the adoption of this bulletin had no effect on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
entitled accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  which provides clarification to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this interpretation is effective on a prospective basis from july  the adoption of this interpretation had no effect on our financial statements 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages  and equipment 
although the exact impact is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations 
risk factors many statements contained in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following integrating acquisitions is difficult 
we have acquired radio stations since january  and we expect to make acquisitions of other stations and station groups in the future 
the integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired stations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management that might be acquired in the future 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new business do not meet expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the new business 
we may not be successful in identifying and consummating future acquisitions  which is an important element of our business strategy 
we pursue growth  in part  through the acquisition of individual radio stations and groups of radio stations 
our consummation of all future acquisitions will be subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under federal and state antitrust laws 
our future acquisitions may be  subject to notification under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and to a waiting period and possible review by the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on us and result in the abandonment of all or part of attractive acquisition opportunities 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or what the consequences will be of any acquisitions 
depending on the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
radio broadcasting is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions is uncertain 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including the following satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which could result in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on the financial condition and results of operations of our company 
we have substantial indebtedness that could have important consequences to you 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity 
at december   we had long term indebtedness of million and shareholders equity of million 
in addition to our obligations on our long term indebtedness  we have quarterly interest obligations on the debentures held by the trust that fund distributions on the tides 
these obligations are substantial in amount and could have a substantial impact on you 
for example  these obligations could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including funding future expansion and ongoing capital expenditures  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
moreover  we may borrow up to an additional million under our existing bank facility 
in addition  at any time prior to december   we may solicit incremental loans up to million 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our indebtedness and the associated risks 
the covenants in our credit facility restrict our financial and operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our bank facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our bank facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
we also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
because of our holding company structure  we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow  and our access to this cash flow is restricted 
we operate as a holding company 
all of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries 
entercom radio  our wholly owned subsidiary  is the borrower under our credit facility and all of our station operating subsidiaries are subsidiaries of entercom radio 
further  we guaranteed entercom radio s obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis 
our obligations on the tides  which were purchased by the trust that sells the tides  are subordinated to our obligations on this guarantee 
as a holding company  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  including corporate overhead and other trade payables  are distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow 
we currently expect that the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations  including servicing their debt obligations  before distributions are made to us 
even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us  we cannot assure you that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including the dividend covenants contained in our credit facility  would permit such dividends or distributions 
we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  priorities of advertisers  fluctuations in operating costs  technological changes and innovations  changes in labor conditions  new laws  including proposals to eliminate the tax deductibility of certain expenses incurred by advertisers  changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the united states department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc  and the requirement to pay fees for the use of sound recordings in internet streaming 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
dependence on seattle radio stations 
the radio stations we own or operate in seattle generated approximately of our net revenues and approximately of our broadcast cash flow for the fiscal year ended december  accordingly we have greater exposure to any operating difficulties that may arise at our seattle stations or to adverse events or conditions that affect the seattle economy than if we were more geographically diverse 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer effectively controls our company  and members of his immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in us 
their interests may conflict with yours 
as of march   joseph m 
field  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
as of march   david j 
field  our president  chief operating officer  one of our directors and the son of joseph m 
field  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our outstanding class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
collectively  joseph m 
field and david j 
field beneficially own all of our outstanding class b common stock 
other members of the field family also own shares of class a common stock 
shares of class b common stock are transferable only to joseph m 
field  david j 
field  certain of their family members or trusts for any of their benefit 
upon any other transfer  shares of our class b common stock convert automatically into shares of our class a common stock on a share for share basis 
shares of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes only when they are voted by joseph m 
field or david j 
field  subject to certain exceptions where they are restricted to one vote 
joseph m 
field generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to the vote of shareholders and  therefore  is able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters where the shares of our class b common stock are only entitled to one vote and those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws or applicable law  including  without limitation  the election of the two class a directors 
without the approval of joseph m 
field  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which investors might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act of we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
for example  in connection with the sinclair kansas city acquisition we were required to dispose of three radio stations in kansas city 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues 
our radio broadcasting stations are in a highly competitive business 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change  and any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market 
while we already compete in some of our markets with other stations with similar programming formats  if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations  if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key executives  including joseph m 
field  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david j 
field  our president and chief operating officer  john c 
donlevie  esq  our executive vice president  secretary and general counsel  and stephen f 
fisher  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
we believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our bank facility requires us to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
as a result  we have entered into various interest rate transactions with various banks  which we call the rate hedging transactions  designed to mitigate our exposure to significantly higher floating interest rates 
these transactions are referred to as a collar and a swap 
a collar consists of a rate cap agreement that establishes an upper limit or cap for the base libor rate and a rate floor agreement that establishes a lower limit or floor for the base libor rate 
collar agreements covering a rate cap and a rate floor have been entered into simultaneously with the same bank 
swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pay to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of february   we have rate hedging transactions in place for a total notional amount of million 
based upon the variable rate debt at december   a basis point change in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately million 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
all of the rate hedging transactions are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these rate hedging transactions is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation for each of the rate hedging transactions 
the three month libor rate at december  was marginally higher than the rate at december  an unrecognized loss resulted from a combination of a benefit from an increase in interest rates offset by a reduction in the remaining term under each of the transactions
