 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met wherein gains and losses are reflected in shareholders equity until the hedged item is recognized 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations 
management believes that the company is well positioned with its mix of oil and gas reserves to take advantage of future price increases that may occur 
however  the uncertainty of oil and gas prices continues to impact the domestic oil and gas industry 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices  the company  from time to time  has used derivative hedging and may do so in the future as a means of controlling its exposure to price changes 
the swap component of the contracts discussed in the following paragraphs was treated as a hedge for accounting purposes only 
the company had entered into three crude oil premium swap contracts related to its production for calendar year two of the contracts provided for payments based on daily nymex settlement prices 
these contracts related to  bbls per day and  bbls per day and had trigger prices of per bbl and per bbl  respectively  and both had knockout prices of per bbl 
these two contracts entitled the company to receive settlements from the counterparties in amounts  if any  by which the settlement price for each nymex trading day was less than the trigger price  provided the nymex price was also greater than the per bbl knockout price 
if a daily settlement price was per bbl or less  then neither party had any liability to the other for that day 
if a daily settlement price was above the applicable trigger price  then the company would owe the counterparty for the excess of the settlement price over the trigger price for that day 
payment was made monthly under each of these contracts  in an amount equal to the net amount due to either party based on the sum of the daily amounts determined as described in this paragraph for that month 
the third contract related to  bbls per day and provided for payments based on monthly average nymex settlement prices 
the contract entitled the company to receive monthly settlements from the counterparty in an amount  if any  by which the arithmetic average of the daily nymex settlement prices for the month was less than the trigger price  which was per bbl  multiplied by the number of days in the month  provided such average nymex price was also greater than the per bbl knockout price 
if the average nymex settlement price for the month was per bbl or less  then neither party would have any liability to the other for that month 
if the average nymex settlement price for the month was above the trigger price  then the company would pay the counterparty an amount equal to the excess of the average settlement price over the trigger price  multiplied by the number of days in the month 
the net effect of these premium swap contracts was a per bbl reduction in the average crude oil price realized by the company in the company has treated the swap component of these contracts as a hedge for accounting purposes only  at swap prices ranging from per bbl to per bbl  which existed at the dates it entered into these contracts 
in addition  the company has separately accounted for the premium component of these contracts by marking them to market  resulting in a gain of  recorded in other income for the year ended december  in addition to the premium swap crude oil hedging contracts  the company had entered into crude oil costless collar hedges from january  to april  for volumes of  bbls per day 
these costless collars had a floor price ranging from per bbl to per bbl and a cap price ranging from per bbl to per bbl 
these costless collar contracts entitled the company to receive settlements from the counterparties in amounts  if any  by which the monthly average settlement price for each nymex trading day during a contract month was less than the floor price 
if the monthly average settlement price was above the applicable cap price  then the company would owe the counterparties for the excess of the monthly average settlement price over the applicable cap price 
if the monthly average settlement price fell between the applicable floor and cap price  then neither party would have any liability to the other party for that month 
payment  if any  was made monthly under each of the contracts in an amount equal to the net amount due either party based on the volumes per day multiplied by the difference between the nymex average price and the cap  if the nymex average price exceeded the cap price  or if the nymex average price was less than the floor price  then the volumes per day multiplied by the difference between the floor price and the nymex average price 
the net effect of these costless collar hedges was a 
per bbl reduction in the average crude oil price realized by the company in the company had no oil or gas hedging contracts for future production as of december  during and  the company had no oil or gas hedging transactions for its production 
ngm  from time to time  employs hedging arrangements in connection with its purchases and sales of production 
while most of ngm s purchases are made for an index based price  ngm s customers often require prices that are either fixed or related to nymex 
in order to establish a fixed margin and mitigate the risk of price volatility  ngm may convert a fixed or nymex sale to an index based sales price such as by purchasing an index based futures contract obligating ngm for delivery of production 
due to the size of such transactions and certain restraints imposed by contract and by company guidelines  as of december   the company had no material market risk exposure from ngm s hedging activity 
the company has a million credit agreement see note debt  to the consolidated financial statements which exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
at december   there was million borrowed against the credit facility which has a maturity date of december  the interest rate is based upon a eurodollar rate plus a range of to basis points 
all other company long term debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
on june   the company entered into a new million day credit agreement with certain commercial lending institutions 
this agreement  which is based upon a eurodollar rate plus to basis points depending upon the percentage of utilization  expired in without ever having been utilized 
the company does not invest in foreign currency derivatives 
the us dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the company s international operations 
transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into us dollars and recorded in the financial statements 
translation gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis 
such gains or losses are included in other expense on the income statement 
however  certain sales transactions are concluded in foreign currencies and the company  therefore  is exposed to potential risk of loss based on fluctuation in exchange rates from time to time
