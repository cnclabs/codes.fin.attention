item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in this report  unless the context requires otherwise  references to we  us  our  or the company are intended to mean kinder morgan  inc a kansas corporation and formerly known as k n energy  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
specifically  as discussed in notes  and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we have engaged in acquisitions including the october acquisition of kinder morgan delaware  inc  a delaware corporation and the indirect owner of the general partner interest in kinder morgan energy partners  lp  a publicly traded master limited partnership  referred to in this report as kinder morgan energy partners  and divestitures including the discontinuance of certain lines of business and the transfer of certain assets to kinder morgan energy partners that may affect comparisons of financial position and results of operations between periods 
business strategy on october   we completed the acquisition of kinder morgan delaware  inc  a delaware corporation and the sole stockholder of the general partner of kinder morgan energy partners 
to effect that acquisition  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of kinder morgan delaware 
upon closing of the transaction  richard d 
kinder  chairman and chief executive officer of kinder morgan delaware  was named chairman and chief executive officer  and we were renamed kinder morgan  inc in accordance with previously announced plans  we implemented and have continued to pursue our back to basics strategy 
this strategy includes the following key aspects i focus on fee based midstream assets that are core to the energy infrastructure of growing markets  ii increase utilization of existing assets while controlling costs  iii leverage economies of scale from incremental acquisitions  iv maximize the benefits of our unique financial structure and v continue to align employee and shareholder incentives 
during  we implemented plans to dispose of our non core businesses and as of december   we have effectively completed the disposition of these assets and operations  all as more fully described in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cash proceeds from these dispositions were largely used to retire debt  contributing to the reduction in outstanding indebtedness during and in addition to sales of non core assets to third parties  we made significant transfers of assets to kinder morgan energy partners at the end of and the end of that  in total  have over billion of fair market value 
by contributing assets to kinder morgan energy partners that are accretive to its earnings and cash flow  we can receive fair market value in the contribution transaction  while still maintaining an indirect interest in the earnings and cash flows of the assets through our limited and general partner interests in kinder morgan energy partners 
as of december   we owned approximately million limited partner units of kinder morgan energy partners  representing approximately of the total units outstanding 
as a result of our general and limited partner interests in kinder morgan energy partners  at the current level of distribution including incentive distributions to the general partner  we currently are entitled to receive approximately of all distributions from kinder morgan energy partners 
the actual level of distributions received by us in the future will vary with the level of distributable cash determined by kinder morgan energy partners partnership agreement 
by increasing our stake in kinder morgan energy partners  we expect to receive additional future cash distributions from kinder morgan energy partners through incremental general partner incentive distributions as well as increased limited partner distributions due to our ownership of additional common units received as compensation in the transfers 
after the dispositions discussed above  our largest business unit and our primary source of operating income is natural gas pipeline company of america ngpl  a major interstate natural gas pipeline system that runs from natural gas producing areas in west texas and the gulf of mexico to its principal market area of chicago  illinois 
in accordance with our strategy to increase operational focus on core assets  we have worked toward agreements to fully utilize the transportation and storage capacity of natural gas pipeline company of america with the result that natural gas pipeline company of america sold out its capacity through the year winter season 
natural gas pipeline company of america continues to pursue opportunities to connect its system to power generation facilities and  in addition  has announced plans to extend its system into the metropolitan east area of st 
louis anchored by a contract with dynegy marketing and trade 
our other remaining business operations consist of the retail distribution of natural gas to approximately  customers in several western and midwestern states and the construction and operation of electric power generation facilities 
our retail natural gas distribution properties are located  in part  in areas where significant growth is occurring and we expect to participate in that growth through increased natural gas demand 
the nation s demand for additional electric power generation is significant and immediate 
our power generation business has a beneficial master turbine purchase agreement that it plans to utilize in constructing a number of natural gas fired electric generation facilities to help meet this need 
these power projects  in addition to generating income in their own right  are expected to increase natural gas pipeline company of america s throughput as described above 
even though we have made significant progress to date  we believe that opportunities remain for increasing shareholder value through cost reductions and other efficiency improvements with respect to both existing assets and future acquisitions 
one measure intended to increase shareholder value is the all employee stock option plan implemented in october through this plan  virtually all employees  with the exception of richard d 
kinder and william v 
morgan each of whom is currently a major shareholder  have received options to purchase shares of our common stock 
richard d 
kinder  our chairman and chief executive officer  and william v 
morgan  our vice chairman and president  each receive only per year in salary and do not receive bonuses 
by aligning employee incentives with shareholder value  we expect to increase employee productivity  retention and satisfaction 
we believe these factors ultimately contribute to increased earnings and overall shareholder value 
to reduce debt and provide funds for future growth  we reduced the regular quarterly common dividend from per share to per share in the fourth quarter of and have maintained it at that level 
the final aspect of our strategy is benefiting from accretive acquisitions and business expansions  primarily by kinder morgan energy partners 
kinder morgan energy partners has a multi year history of making accretive acquisitions  which benefit us through our limited and general partner interests 
this acquisitive strategy is expected to continue  with the population of potential acquisition candidates being driven by consolidation in the energy industry  as well as rationalization of asset portfolios by major corporations 
in addition  we expect to  within strict guidelines as to rate of return and risk and timing of cash flows  expand natural gas pipeline company of america s pipeline system  acquire natural gas distribution properties that fit well with the current profile and build and acquire incremental power generation facilities

our results for  in comparison to  reflect an increase of million in operating revenues  a decrease of million in gross margin and an increase of million in operating income before merger related and severance costs 
the increase in operating revenues is principally due to i increased natural gas sales volumes and prices on the kinder morgan texas pipeline  lp system transferred to kinder morgan energy partners in december  ii weather related increases in natural gas sales and transportation volumes on kinder morgan retail s system and iii increased storage service revenues and operational gas sales from natural gas pipeline company of america  partially offset by the exclusion from results of the operations of kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc 
kinder morgan interstate gas transmission was contributed to kinder morgan energy partners at december   while kinder morgan texas pipeline was contributed to kinder morgan energy partners at december  these transactions are described in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in gross margin that occurred from to  despite the increased operating revenues  was principally due to the fact that results do not include the results of kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc

results of operations we manage our various businesses by  among other things  allocating capital and monitoring operating performance 
this management process includes dividing the overall company into business units so that performance can be effectively monitored and reported for a limited number of discrete businesses 
currently  we manage and report our operations in the following business units business unit business conducted referred to as natural gas pipeline company of america and certain affiliates major interstate natural gas pipeline and storage system natural gas pipeline company of america retail natural gas distribution the regulated sale of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers and non utility sales of natural gas to certain utility customers under the choice gas program kinder morgan retail power generation and other the construction and operation of natural gas fired electric generation facilities  together with various other activities not constituting separately managed or reportable business segments power and other in previous periods  we owned and operated other lines of business  which we discontinued during in addition  our direct investment in the natural gas transmission and storage business has significantly decreased as a result of i the december  sale of kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc  referred to in this report as kinder morgan interstate  to kinder morgan energy partners and ii the december sale of kinder morgan texas pipeline  lp  referred to in this report as kinder morgan texas pipeline  to kinder morgan energy partners 
the results of operations of these two businesses are included in our financial statements until their disposition  which is discussed under general in this portion of the form k and in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies applied in the generation of business unit information are generally the same as those described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  except that items below the operating income line are either not allocated to business units or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business unit performance 
an exception to this is that power  which routinely conducts its business activities in the form of joint operations with other parties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  includes its equity in earnings of these investees in its business unit operating results 
these equity method earnings are included in other income and expenses in our consolidated income statement 
in addition  certain items included in consolidated operating income such as merger related and severance costs and general and administrative expenses are not allocated to individual business units 
with adjustment for these items  we currently evaluate business unit performance primarily based on operating income in relation to the level of assets employed 
sales between business units are accounted for at market prices

these negative impacts were partially offset by i increased revenues in due to higher transportation rates under the terms of the general rate case and ii reduced depreciation expense in resulting from the assets of kinder morgan interstate being classified as assets held for sale effective november   at which time further depreciation of these assets was suspended in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

partially offsetting this increase were i an increase in cash used for working capital of million and ii january payments associated with december gas supply purchases

net cash flows from financing activities net cash flows used in provided by financing activities decreased from approximately billion in to million in  a decline of approximately million 
this decrease was principally due to the first quarter repayment of the billion substitute note as discussed preceding  partially offset by increased short term borrowings during the same period  as well as reduced cash payments for dividends in net cash flows used in provided by financing activities decreased from a net inflow of billion in to a net outflow of billion in this decrease was principally the result of the financings associated with the acquisition of midcon corp 
and the repayment of the substitute note in  in each case as described following 
in addition  we retired million of long term debt in  compared to million in the long term debt retired in included million of debt assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of kinder morgan delaware 
our principal sources of short term liquidity are our revolving bank facilities 
as of december   we had available a million day facility dated october   and a million amended and restated five year revolving credit agreement dated january  these bank facilities can be used for general corporate purposes  including backup for our commercial paper program 
at december   we had million of bank borrowings and commercial paper which is backed by the bank facilities issued and outstanding 
the corresponding amount outstanding was million at february  after inclusion of applicable letters of credit  the remaining available borrowing capacity under the bank facilities was million and million at december  and february   respectively 
the bank facilities include covenants that are common in such arrangements 
for example  the million facility requires consolidated debt to be less than of consolidated total capitalization 
the million facility requires that upon issuance of common stock to the holders of the premium equity participating security units at the maturity of the security units november  consolidated debt must be less than of consolidated total capitalization 
both of the bank facilities require the debt of consolidated subsidiaries to be less than of our consolidated debt and require the consolidated debt of each material subsidiary to be less than of our consolidated total capitalization 
the million facility requires our consolidated net worth inclusive of trust preferred securities be at least billion plus percent of consolidated net income earned for each fiscal quarter beginning with the last quarter of the million facility requires our consolidated net worth inclusive of trust preferred securities be at least billion plus percent of consolidated net income earned for each fiscal quarter beginning with the last quarter of our short term debt of million at december  consisted of i million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  ii the million of reset put securities that are scheduled to be either remarketed or retired as of march   iii the million of senior notes  due november and iv million of miscellaneous current maturities of long term debt 
we expect to retire the reset put securities at march  utilizing a combination of cash on hand and incremental short term borrowings  which will result in an extraordinary loss on early extinguishments of debt expected to total approximately million 
we expect that the million of senior notes will be retired at maturity with a portion of the million of cash to be received from the issuance of common stock upon maturity of the premium equity participating securities  which occurs concurrently as discussed following 
apart from these items  our current assets and current liabilities are approximately equal 
given our expected cash flows from operations and our unused debt capacity  including our five year revolving credit facility  we do not expect any liquidity issues in the foreseeable future 
in september  we established an accounts receivable sales facility that provided up to million of additional liquidity 
in accordance with this agreement  we received proceeds of million on september  cash flows associated with this facility are included with cash flows from operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
in february  we reduced our participation in this receivables sales program by million  principally as a result of our then pending disposition of our wholesale gas marketing business 
on april   we repaid the residual balance and terminated the agreement 
in november  we sold million principal amount of premium equity participating securities in a public offering 
the proceeds from the security units offering was used to purchase us treasury notes on behalf of the security unit holders  which notes are the property of the security unit holders and will be held as collateral to fund the obligation of the security unit holders to purchase our common stock at the end of a three year period 
in november  the maturity of these securities will result in our receipt of million in cash as discussed above and  based on the market price of our common stock as of november   the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
the cash proceeds are expected to be used to retire the million of senior notes that mature concurrently with the premium equity participating securities and to repay a portion of short term borrowings then outstanding 
in march  we issued million shares million shares after adjustment for the december three for two stock split of common stock in an underwritten public offering  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
also in march  we issued billion principal amount of debt securities of varying maturities and interest rates in an underwritten public offering  receiving net proceeds of approximately billion 
the net proceeds from these two offerings were used to refinance borrowings under the midcon corp 
acquisition financing arrangements and to purchase us government securities to collateralize a portion of the substitute note assumed in conjunction with the acquisition 
in april  we sold million of capital securities due april   in an underwritten offering  with the net proceeds of million used to purchase us government securities to further collateralize the substitute note 
in november  we completed the underwritten public offering of million of three year senior notes concurrently with the million principal amount of premium equity participating security units discussed above 
the million of net proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to retire a portion of our then outstanding short term borrowings 
for additional information on each of these financings  including terms of the specific securities and the associated accounting treatment  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
on january   we repaid the billion substitute note payable to occidental petroleum as part of the midcon corp 
acquisition 
the note was repaid using the proceeds of approximately billion from the sale of us government securities that had been held as collateral  with the balance of the funds provided by an increase in short term borrowings 
capital expenditures and commitments capital expenditures in were million and million for continuing operations and discontinued operations  respectively 
the capital expenditure budget totals approximately million  before expenditures which may be made on the horizon pipeline project 
we expect that funding for the budget will be provided from internal sources and  if necessary  incremental borrowings 
approximately million of this amount had been committed for the purchase of plant and equipment at december  additional information on commitments is contained in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation and environmental our anticipated environmental capital costs and expenses for  including expected costs for remediation efforts  are approximately million  compared to million of such costs and expenses incurred in a substantial portion of our environmental costs are either recoverable through insurance and indemnification provisions or have previously recorded liabilities associated with them 
refer to notes a and b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pending litigation and environmental matters 
we believe we have established adequate reserves such that the resolution of pending litigation and environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
regulation see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory matters 
risk management the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information on our risk management activities 
to minimize the risk of price changes in the natural gas and associated transportation markets  we use certain financial instruments for hedging purposes 
these instruments include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange  the kansas city board of trade and over the counter markets including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts and fixed price swaps 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments but  given their existing credit ratings  we do not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
pursuant to a policy approved by our board of directors  we are to engage in these activities only as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with i pre existing or anticipated physical gas sales  ii physical gas purchases and iii system use and storage in order to protect profit margins  and not to engage in speculative trading 
commodity related activities of the risk management group are monitored by our risk management committee  which is charged with the review and enforcement of the board of directors risk management policy 
the risk management committee reviews the types of hedging instruments used  contract limits and approval levels and may review the pricing and hedging of any or all commodity transactions 
all energy futures  swaps and options are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of these risk management instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts 
market quotes are available for substantially all financial instruments we use 
through december   gains and losses on hedging positions have been deferred and recognized as gas purchases expense in the periods in which the underlying physical transactions occur 
on january   we began accounting for derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  after amendment by sfas and sfas  the statement 
as discussed preceding  our principal use of derivative financial instruments is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas 
the statement allows these transactions to continue to be treated as hedges for accounting purposes  although the changes in the market value of these instruments will affect comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and any ineffectiveness in the risk mitigation performance of the hedge will affect net income currently 
the change in the market value of these instruments representing effective hedge operation will continue to affect net income in the period in which the associated physical transactions are consummated 
adoption of the statement has resulted in million of deferred net loss as of january   being reported as part of other comprehensive income in  as well as subsequent changes in the market value of these derivatives prior to consummation of the transaction being hedged 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas and natural gas liquids markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the marked to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of percent for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a percent probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
instruments evaluated by the model include forward physical gas  storage and transportation contracts and financial products including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
during  value at risk reached a high of million and a low of million 
value at risk at december   was million and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
as a result of our recent divestiture of certain lines of business  including our wholesale natural gas and liquids marketing and natural gas gathering  processing and associated businesses  we expect that our portfolio of financial instruments held for the purposes of hedging  and corresponding exposure to loss from such instruments  will be smaller in the future 
given our portfolio of businesses as of december   our principal uses of derivative financial instruments will be to mitigate the risk associated with market movements in the price of natural gas associated with i the sale of in kind fuel recoveries in excess of fuel used on natural gas pipeline company of america s pipeline system and ii the purchase of natural gas by kinder morgan retail to serve its customers in the choice gas program 
from time to time  our treasury department manages interest rate exposure utilizing interest rate swaps  caps or similar derivatives within board established policy 
none of these interest rate derivatives is leveraged 
we are currently not hedging our interest rate exposure resulting from short term borrowings 
the market risk related to short term borrowings from a one percent change in interest rates would result in a million annual impact on pre tax income  based on short term borrowing levels as of february  significant operating variables our principal exposure to market variability is related to the variation in natural gas prices and basis differentials  which can affect gross margins in our natural gas pipeline company of america and kinder morgan retail segments 
basis differential is a term that refers to the difference in natural gas prices between two locations or two points in time 
these price differences can be affected by  among other things  natural gas supply and demand  available transportation capacity  storage inventories and deliverability  prices of alternative fuels and weather conditions 
in recent periods  additional competitive pressures have been generated in midwest natural gas markets due to the introduction and planned introduction of additional supplies into the chicago market area  although incremental take away capacity has also been constructed 
we have attempted to reduce our exposure to this form of market variability by pursuing long term  fixed rate type contract agreements for capacity on natural gas pipeline company of america 
in addition  as discussed under risk management elsewhere in this document and in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we utilize a comprehensive risk management program to mitigate our exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas and associated transportation
