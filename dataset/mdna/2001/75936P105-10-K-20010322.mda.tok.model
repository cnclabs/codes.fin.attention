inflation substantially all of wellsford capital s and wellsford whitehall s office leases provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measures 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
a substantial majority of the leases at the company s multifamily properties are for a term of one year or less which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of apartment units 
such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
net cash flow the company considers net cash flow to be an important measure of its performance  to be considered in addition to net income predicated on generally accepted accounting principles 
net cash flow  for the company s purposes  represents net income  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  the provision for impairment and depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures offset by accumulated depreciation on assets sold 
included in such cash flow is the company s share of undistributed cash retained by the unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures for continuing investment in lieu of future fundings 
net cash flow should not be considered a replacement for net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the following table reconciles net income and net cash flow for the years ended december  net income    add depreciation and amortization    provision for impairment a  accumulated depreciation on assets sold  share of jv depreciation and amortization    net cash flow    note the number of shares that should be used for determining net cash flow per share  basic and diluted  are the same number of shares used for net income per share  basic and diluted
