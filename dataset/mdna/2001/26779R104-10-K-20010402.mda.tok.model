overview fairmarket develops and delivers e business selling and marketing solutions for traditional retailers  distributors and manufacturers and for internet portals and web communities primarily engaged in e commerce 
these hosted  scalable solutions  built upon our proprietary dynamic pricing software  are designed to help clients maximize price yield and promote their brands 
we work with customers at any point along the demand chain 
our software is designed for rapid deployment and integrates with existing customer web sites and back office systems 
our services are used in four primary areas retail and discount clearance  business to business surplus  promotions and interactive marketing  and outsourced auctions and e commerce to portals and other web communities 
we provide a broad suite of dynamic pricing formats  including auctions  our primary format  as well as fixed and falling price formats  and integrated cross sell and up sell capability  to create a comprehensive e business selling and marketing service offering 
because we host our customer s dynamic pricing sites on our central operating systems  we have the ability to aggregate listings of goods and services available for sale on our customers commerce sites and make those listings available for display and sale on other fairmarket customer sites 
we refer to this network of customer sites as the fairmarket network 
fairmarket was formed in february from our inception through may  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to our initial business model of matching buyers and sellers of computer products and peripherals utilizing our own internet auction web site 
in december  we began to execute our current business model involving the offering of outsourced  private label auction solutions as described above  which we have since expanded to include additional transaction pricing and extended marketing and distribution capabilities 
we ceased operating our own auction site during the third quarter of recent developments in march  we sold  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering 
the proceeds to us from the initial public offering were million  net of offering expenses 
as described above under business  over the past year we have launched a number of new pricing formats as well as new features and tools which substantially enhance our ability to integrate our customers dynamic pricing sites with their back end systems and improve our customers ability to upload product catalogs and process orders  and have also extended our marketing and distribution capabilities 
we believe our success is dependent in large part on increasing our customer base and further developing the breadth and functionality of our service offerings 
we intend to continue to invest in the further development of our service offerings and technology  in the marketing and promotion of our service offerings  and in our services organization 
while it is our stated goal to increase revenue for the year by to compared to total revenue for the year and to achieve operating cash flow break even during the first quarter of  we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses and significant negative operating cash flows for the first quarter of  which we expect will decrease during the rest of during  we expanded our international operations by opening a full service office in london  england  early in the year  opening an office in australia during the summer of and opening an office in germany at the end of the year  and forming uk  australia and german subsidiaries 
in june  we announced the launch of the fairmarket network uk 
we may expand our operations to serve other countries in the future 
expansion into international markets requires significant management  financial  development  sales  marketing and other resources 
in addition  there are risks inherent in doing business internationally  including  among others  fluctuating currency exchange rates  differing legal and regulatory requirements and differing accounting practices 
for the year ended december   revenue under contracts with customers outside the us was less than of our total revenue 
from december  to december   our employee base grew from to employees  and subsequently grew to employees at september   with most of that growth having occurred in the first quarter of in october  as part of our plan to implement cost cutting measures  we eliminated positions at our massachusetts facility  representing of our total employee base 
after giving effect to this workforce reduction  we had employees worldwide 
we paid all expenses related to this workforce reduction including severance expenses by the end of the fourth quarter of and recognized a charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of for the costs related to the workforce reduction 
this workforce reduction required the dedication of management and other resources that temporarily detracted from attention to the daily business of the company and may have caused a disruption of our business activities  which in turn may have had an adverse effect on our operating results for the fourth quarter of we experienced some attrition prior to and following the workforce reduction and believe that we may experience additional attrition in the future 
our ability to maintain or increase revenue will depend in part upon our ability to hire  retain and train qualified personnel 
as of december   we had full time employees 
on january   we implemented a one time employee incentive program under which employees had the opportunity to exchange  on a one for one basis  their outstanding employee stock options with exercise prices of or above for new options with an exercise price of  the closing price of our common stock on the january  exchange date 
options held by executive officers and directors were not included in the exchange 
under this program  options covering approximately  shares of our common stock were exchanged for options covering an equal number of shares 
options granted under this program have special terms  with the options vesting over two years  quarterly  beginning on the three month anniversary of the date of grant  if the option exchanged was unvested  or vesting on the six month anniversary of the grant date  if the option exchanged was vested  and having a term of two and one half years 
for accounting purposes  the exchange constituted a repricing of the existing options and will require variable accounting for the new options granted in the exchange 
as a result  we will recognize a non cash compensation charge each quarter  beginning with the first quarter of  if and to the extent that the per share fair market value of our common stock at the end of the quarter exceeds  the per share exercise price of the new options 
as a result  there is a potential for such a non cash charge in each quarter until all of the new options are exercised or until the date the options expire july  or otherwise terminate 
because of our limited operating history  there is limited operating and financial data about our business upon which to base an evaluation of our performance 
period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future operating results 
sources of revenue we derive revenue from application fees  which consist of site implementation and fixed monthly hosting  support and operating fees  transaction fees  and professional services fees  which include fees for the development of business applications  technical customization and integration including as part of the site implementation process  and e marketing  usability and other consulting services 
we generally charge a one time set up fee for the design  development and implementation of a customer s dynamic pricing site 
implementation of a customer site also frequently entails customization and other professional services  for which we charge a professional services fee 
the set up fee and implementation related professional services fees vary depending on the nature of the site and the anticipated complexity of the site 
fixed monthly fees are generally charged to customers and cover hosting services  direct customer support services  end user customer support services  services for online billing and collection of fees for community sites and other monthly operating services 
fixed monthly fees vary by customer depending on the number of software modules employed  the required level of services and the anticipated level of site activity 
we also offer our customers a range of business application  technical customization  integration  e marketing  usability and other consulting services related to our product offerings for which we may charge either a one time or a monthly professional services fee  depending on the nature of the service 
transaction fees consist of our share of success fees charged to sellers upon a completed sale  listing fees  and enhanced listing fees  which are fees charged for the prominent display of a particular seller listing such as under a list of featured listings 
merchant customers pay transaction fees at varying percentages based on the gross proceeds from the sale of their listed products and services  whether sold on their sites or on other fairmarket network sites 
community customers pay transaction fees calculated in one of two ways 
generally  under contracts entered into before  these fees are calculated based on a percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale of the items that are listed through the community site and sold either on the community site or on other fairmarket network sites 
the fee percentages vary by customer depending on the anticipated level of activity on the customer s site and the level of the fixed monthly fees 
these communities receive a percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale of items that are listed directly on other sites in the fairmarket network and sold through the community site 
contracts entered into starting in early generally provide for payment by the community customer of transaction fees with respect to the sale of listings that are placed on the community site that are calculated as a percentage of the success fee that the community charges to its end users  similarly  for listings that are listed directly through other sites in the fairmarket network and sold through the community site  the community site receives a percentage of the transaction fee that the listing site charges to the listing site s end user when the listing sells 
we record revenue net of amounts shared with our customers 
of our total revenue for  excluding one time business development fees  revenues related to application fees represented approximately of total revenue  revenues related to transaction fees represented approximately of total revenue and professional services fees represented approximately of total revenue 
with the launch of our professional services group during the fourth quarter of  we believe that professional services fees will increase as a percentage of total revenue during at no point during the sale process do we take possession of either the products being sold or the buyers payment for the item 
because merchants and individual sellers  rather than fairmarket  sell the items listed  we have no cost of goods sold  procurement  or carrying or shipping costs and no inventory risk related to the items sold 
results of operations for the years ended december   and for the years ended december   and  our net loss was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net loss of approximately million from to was primarily due to an increase in total operating expenses of approximately million over such periods  partially offset by an increase in revenue of approximately million and an increase in interest income of million 
the increase in net loss of approximately million from to was primarily due to an increase in total operating expenses of approximately million over such periods  partially offset by an increase in revenue of approximately million and an increase in interest income of  revenue total revenue increased to million in from million in and  in the increase in revenue of million from to was primarily due to an increase in monthly service revenue generated from new customers added during the latter half of and throughout in addition  in the second half of fairmarket recognized  of one time  business development revenues 
during  our revenue was derived primarily from transaction fees charged to sellers of computer equipment and peripherals on our former auction web site 
in december  we began offering an outsourced  private label auction solution to merchant customers and online community customers  deriving our revenue from monthly service fees and a share of fees from transactions completed on auction sites participating in the fairmarket network 
we ceased operating our own auction site during the third quarter of the increase in revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in monthly service revenue generated from new customers in the one time set up fees we charge for the implementation of customer sites and implementation related professional services are deferred and recorded as revenue over the term of the related contracts 
at december  and  there was  and  of deferred revenue  respectively  relating to set up fees 
we also defer recognition of transaction fee revenue arising from our auction services agreement with microsoft corporation 
in  we also deferred recognition of transaction fee revenue under our original auction services agreement with excite  inc total deferred revenue under these contracts was  at december  and  at december  during the latter half of  we shifted our sales focus away from outsourced e commerce for portals and traffic building applications for dot coms to providing demand chain sell side solutions  such as enabling the web based sale of retail and discount clearance items and business to business surplus and hosting interactive marketing promotions for larger retailers and manufacturers with higher brand awareness and greater financial resources 
because the sales cycle for larger retailers and manufacturers is generally longer than the sales cycle for companies engaged purely in e commerce  and because the implementation period for larger retailers and manufacturers tends to be longer than the implementation periods we experience with companies engaged purely in e commerce  we believe that this change in focus has caused the rate of our revenue growth to moderate from prior periods 
as a result of this shift in business mix and partially as a result of a general price increase that we effected in early  approximately customer contracts were terminated  either by us or by the customer  during as of december   we had approximately customers 
also as a result of this shift in business mix and a general price increase we implemented early in  average annual revenue per customer excluding one time business development revenues increased from  for to  for we expect revenue to increase during as we add new customers and sell new services 
average revenue per customer for future periods will depend on a number of factors such as our customer mix  the mix of our service offerings  technological changes  our pricing strategies and pricing competition 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
cost of revenue was not material during cost of revenue consists of costs for both direct customer support and support to end users of our customers sites  depreciation of network equipment  fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and monthly fees paid to third party network providers 
the million increase in cost of revenue from to resulted primarily from the continued development and expansion of our customer support and end user customer service organizations and costs related to our us and international data centers  including depreciation of network equipment and fees paid for bandwidth and third party network providers 
the increase in cost of revenue from to was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses relating to the increase in our employee base across all functions to support our anticipated growth  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in costs for the provision and maintenance of the fairmarket network 
gross profit increased to for compared to for this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue at a higher rate than the increase in cost of revenue over these periods 
the gross profit reported above is not necessarily indicative of gross profit for future periods 
while gross profit is expected to increase in the future  actual gross profit may vary significantly depending on  among other things  customer mix  product mix  price competition  technological changes and extraordinary costs 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in and  in the million increase in sales and marketing expenses from to was primarily due to an increase in advertising expense  an increase in salaries and related expenses resulting from an increase in the average number of sales and marketing employees over that period  an increase in fees paid to outside contract service providers and expanded marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses for include million for advertising services purchased from excite  inc under the terms of our original auction services agreement with excite  now known as at home corporation 
in connection with the restructuring of our relationship with at home in december  we purchased an incremental  for advertising services from at home as part of the termination of the original excite agreement 
the million increase in sales and marketing expenses from to resulted primarily from the building of a sales and marketing organization and the commencement during the second half of of a significant increase in advertising and promotional activities 
sales and marketing expenses for include million for advertising services purchased from excite under the terms of the original excite agreement 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will decrease in compared to primarily as a result of the termination of the original auction services agreement with excite and the resulting elimination of our obligation to purchase million per quarter in banner advertising from excite 
development and engineering development and engineering expenses increased to million in from million in and  in the million increase in development and engineering expenses from to was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses resulting from an increase in the number of development and engineering employees in compared to the increase of million from to was primarily due to the hiring of additional engineering personnel and other engineering costs incurred to enhance and scale our online auction system and the fairmarket network 
we believe that development and engineering expenses will decrease in compared to primarily as a result of slightly lower headcount in as compared to our policy is to capitalize development and engineering costs associated with the design and implementation of our operating systems  including internally and externally developed software  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
accordingly  costs capitalized were  and  in and  respectively 
these costs are being amortized over months  which is the expected useful life of the software 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and  in the million increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses of million resulting from an increase in the average number of employees in our finance and accounting  human resources and legal departments  an increase in depreciation on property and equipment of million  an increase in facility costs of million related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters in the first quarter of and costs associated with our new international offices  an increase in legal  accounting and tax fees of million  an increase in fees paid to outside contract service providers of  an increase in insurance costs of  and an increase in bad debt expense of  the allowance for doubtful accounts at the beginning of was  during  we recognized a charge to earnings of million to increase the allowance and wrote off  of uncollectible accounts 
the million increase in total general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to building finance and human resources departments combined with external recruiting contractor costs supporting all functional areas 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will decrease during due to further cost containment measures that we plan to take during the allowance for doubtful accounts at the beginning of was during  we recognized a charge to earnings of  to increase the allowance and wrote off  of uncollectible accounts 
equity related charges equity related charges consist of the amortization of deferred stock compensation resulting from the grant of stock options to employees at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date and the fair value of warrants issued to strategic partners and shares of series d convertible preferred stock issued to strategic partners at prices below their fair value 
at december   deferred stock compensation  which is a component of deferred compensation and equity related charges in stockholders equity  totaled approximately million  net of million relating to stock options canceled in and amortization of approximately million in and million in this amount is being amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the applicable stock options  typically four years  with vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and the balance vesting quarterly thereafter 
we expect to incur equity related compensation expense of at least million in  million in  million in and  in at december   equity related charges  which is a component of deferred compensation and equity related charges in stockholders equity  totaled approximately million  net of amortization of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
this amount is being amortized ratably over the terms of the related agreements  from three to five years 
we expect to incur equity related charges of at least million in  million in  million in and million in interest income  net interest income increased to million in from  in and  in the million increase in interest income from to was primarily due to a higher average cash balance during compared to the increase is primarily the result of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments  particularly interest earned on the million in net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our series d convertible preferred stock in august and september described below  combined with interest earned on the million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in march the increase in interest income of  from to was primarily due to a higher average cash balance during compared to the average cash balance increased in compared to primarily due to the sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock  partially offset by increases in the use of cash in operations and in investing activities 
in february  we completed the sale of approximately  shares of our series c convertible preferred stock  the net cash proceeds of which totaled approximately million  and in august and september  we completed the sale of  and  shares  respectively  of our series d convertible preferred stock  the net cash proceeds of which totaled approximately million 
microsoft and excite contracts our auction services agreement with microsoft  which we entered into in july  provides that  if microsoft drives more than a specified number of internet users to the fairmarket network through the microsoft internet portal sites  we will guarantee a minimum level of transaction fee revenue regardless of actual transaction fee revenue earned by microsoft 
if microsoft meets its minimum annual traffic guarantee but such increase in traffic does not produce sufficient revenue to meet the minimum guaranteed revenue  we will have a financial obligation to microsoft 
this obligation will be an amount equal to the difference between the minimum guaranteed payment and microsoft s portion of fees actually collected 
our agreement with microsoft provided for minimum guaranteed revenue of million for the first contract year and provides for minimum guaranteed revenue of million  million  million and million for the second  third  fourth and fifth contract years  respectively 
microsoft did not meet its minimum annual traffic guarantee for the first contract year and therefore no payment was required 
while we do not expect that we will be required to make any payment under the minimum guaranteed revenue provisions for the second contract year based on results of the first contract year  any payments we have to make to satisfy the minimum guaranteed revenue levels under this agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we defer recognition of revenue on our share of transaction fees under the microsoft agreement until microsoft receives the minimum guaranteed revenue or until it fails to meet its performance targets 
at december   we had deferred  of transaction fee revenue related to the agreement with microsoft 
in december  we restructured our relationship with excite  now known as at home corporation  by terminating our original auction services agreement with excite and entering into a new outlet center agreement 
under the termination agreement  fairmarket purchased an incremental  in banner advertising from at home during the fourth quarter of  which is reflected as an expense in the quarter  and also licensed a permission based email marketing database from an affiliate of at home for million  which was paid during the fourth quarter of and is being amortized over its useful life in as a result of the termination of the original excite agreement  we were released from our obligation to purchase a remaining million of online banner and other advertising services under the original agreement  and we released any exclusive rights to provide auction services to consumers on the excite network 
under the new outlet center agreement  which has an initial term of months  we have agreed to provide an excite branded version of our outlet center service  on which auction  falling price and fixed price listings of our merchant customers are made available for display to and purchase by users of the excite network 
our original agreement with excite also contained a provision similar to the provision in the microsoft agreement described above  except that the agreement with excite provided for minimum guaranteed revenue of million for the first contract year 
excite did not meet its minimum annual traffic guarantee for the first contract year and therefore no payment was required 
at december   we had deferred  of transaction fee revenue from microsoft and excite under these agreements 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in march  we financed our operations primarily through private sales of capital stock  the net proceeds of which totaled approximately million as of december  in march  we sold  shares of common stock in our initial public offering 
the proceeds to us from the initial public offering were million  net of offering expenses 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash related to a lease deposit totaled approximately million 
cash used in operating activities was approximately million for and million for net cash flows from operating activities in reflect a net loss of million reduced by non cash charges for advertising of million and amortization of deferred compensation and equity related charges of million 
net cash flows from operating activities in reflect a net loss of million reduced by non cash charges for advertising of million and amortization of deferred compensation and equity related charges of million 
to a lesser extent  net cash flows from operating activities for each period reflect an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets and a change in accounts payable  offset in part by increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses 
included in the increase of prepaid expenses and other current assets for is million paid during the fourth quarter of to license a permission based email marketing database from an affiliate of at home 
this amount will be amortized over the useful life of the asset in cash used in investing activities was million in and million in net cash used in investing activities for and includes million and million  respectively  for the purchase of marketable securities  net  and million and million  respectively  for the purchase of property and equipment  net of capital lease obligations of  at december  during and  we purchased computers and servers at a total cost of million and million  respectively  to support the expansion of the fairmarket network both domestically and internationally including the opening of data centers in england and australia and to provide computers and equipment for new employees  as well as furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements at a total cost of million and  for and  respectively  primarily in connection with the buildout and relocation of our corporate headquarters during the first quarter of we expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in  primarily for the purchase of computer related equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in includes proceeds of million from our initial public offering  net of expenses of million 
in addition  in connection with our initial public offering  excite paid to us million in accordance with a stock purchase agreement in which excite purchased  shares of our series d convertible preferred stock for cash consideration of million in the third quarter of  which payment was withheld as a prepayment against our obligation to purchase advertising from excite 
the cash consideration withheld was recorded as a subscription receivable in the stockholders equity section of the accompanying balance sheet as of december  the subscription receivable was reduced by excite s payment of million in connection with our initial public offering and by the advertising we purchased from excite totaling million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in consists of the proceeds from private sales of shares of our convertible preferred stock 
we expect our operating expenses to decrease in compared to and expect to fund these expenses primarily from available cash 
in addition  we may utilize our cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next year 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
if additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all 
factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of you can identify forward looking statements by the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume and other similar expressions which predict or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters 
you should not rely on forward looking statements  because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that might cause these differences include those set forth below 
you should carefully review all of these factors  and you should be aware that there may be other factors that could cause these differences 
these forward looking statements were based on information  plans and estimates at the date of this form k  and we do not promise to update any forward looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors  new information  future events or other changes 
risks related to our business because we have only been in business for a short time  our business is difficult to evaluate  our business strategy may not successfully address risks we face and your basis for evaluating us is limited 
we were formed in february and we began to execute our current business model involving the offering of outsourced  private label auction solutions in december  which we have since expanded to include additional transaction pricing and extended marketing and distribution capabilities 
while a high percentage of our operating expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the short term  our operating expenses are largely based on unpredictable revenue trends 
because of our limited operating history  our business strategy may not successfully address all of the risks we face  and you have limited operating and financial data about our business upon which to base an evaluation of our performance 
we face the following risks  expenses and difficulties as a company seeking to develop a new internet based service if we fail to attract and retain quality customers we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our business  if we fail to attract and retain qualified sales  engineering and other personnel we may be unable to maintain and expand our business  if we fail to maintain and upgrade our service offerings and technology to keep pace with the rapidly growing internet market we serve we may be unable to compete effectively  and if we fail to raise additional capital if and when we need it we may be unable to develop or sustain our business 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the near future 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of approximately million  which represented approximately of our revenue for the same period 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have not achieved profitability and we will continue to incur net losses until we can produce sufficient revenues to cover our costs  which may not occur 
while it is our goal to achieve operating cash flow breakeven during the first quarter of  even if we achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future because we intend to continue to invest in the further development of our service offerings and technology  in the marketing and promotion of our service offerings and in our services organization 
any such investment will depend on the availability of funds 
we expect to continue to have negative operating cash flow in the near future which may require us to seek additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain 
we expect to continue to experience significant negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to make significant investments in the further development of our service offerings and technology  in the marketing and promotion of our service offerings and in our services organization 
we expect that we will fund these expenditures primarily from available cash 
we believe that  with the proceeds of our march initial public offering  we have sufficient capital to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
while it is our goal to achieve operating cash flow breakeven during the first quarter of  we cannot assure you that we will meet that goal or achieve profitable operations 
depending on future cash flow  we may need to raise additional capital in the future to meet our cash requirements 
we may not be able to find additional financing  if required  on favorable terms or at all 
we may not be able to continue attracting new customers 
the success of our business model depends in large part on our ability to increase our number of customers 
the market for our services may grow more slowly than anticipated or become saturated with competitors  many of which may offer lower prices or broader distribution 
some potential customers may not want to join the fairmarket network because they are concerned about the possibility of their products being listed together with their competitors products 
during the second half of  we increased our sales focus on larger retailers and manufacturers with higher brand awareness and greater financial resources 
the sales cycle for larger retailers and manufacturers is generally longer than the sales cycle for companies engaged purely in e commerce  and the implementation period for larger retailers and manufacturers tends to be longer than the implementation periods we experience with companies engaged purely in e commerce 
if we cannot continue to bring new customers to the fairmarket network on a timely basis or at all  or if we cannot maintain our existing customer base  we may be unable to offer the benefits of the network model at levels sufficient to attract and retain customers and sustain our business 
our customers may not successfully drive user traffic from their main web sites to their dynamic pricing sites 
our success will also depend in part on increases in the amount of traffic and the number of transactions on our customers fairmarket powered sites 
for this to occur  our existing customers must drive sufficient numbers of users to their auction and other dynamic pricing sites  they must devote sufficient resources to making their sites attractive to buyers and sellers and there must be demand for the products being offered on those sites 
we cannot assure you that our customers will be successful in accomplishing any of these objectives and their failure to do so could impede our growth and adversely affect our business 
buyers and sellers might not adopt online auction or other dynamic pricing solutions as a means for buying and selling goods and services 
online auction and other dynamic pricing solutions are relatively new methods of buying and selling that market participants may not adopt at levels sufficient to sustain our business 
traditional purchasing is often based on long standing relationships or familiarity with sellers 
for online dynamic pricing solutions to succeed  buyers and sellers must adopt new purchasing practices 
buyers must be willing to rely less upon traditional relationships in making purchasing decisions  and merchants and internet communities must be willing to offer products for sale through online dynamic pricing solutions 
we cannot assure you that buyers  merchants or internet communities will choose to utilize online dynamic pricing solutions at levels sufficient to sustain our business 
because our industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry  we may not be able to effectively compete 
the us market for e commerce services is extremely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
in addition to competition from internally developed solutions by individual organizations  our primary direct competitors are the following providers of hosted auction services bid 
com  bidland  dealdeal 
com and siebel systems opensite 
we also face competition for customers from third party providers in the following areas software providers and application service providers such as ariba  auction broker  commerce one  moai technologies and siebel systems opensite  destination auction and auction aggregation sites such as amazon 
com  andale  auctionwatch 
com  auctionworks  ebay  goto auctions and yahoo auctions  and e commerce vendors such as atg  broadvision  ibm and openmarket who either have or may extend their offerings to incorporate capabilities similar to those offered by our services 
the principal competitive factors are the quality and breadth of services provided  potential for successful transaction activity and price 
e commerce markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product and service introductions 
we may fail to introduce new online pricing formats and features on a timely basis or at all 
if we fail to introduce new service offerings or to improve our existing service offerings in response to industry developments  or if our prices are not competitive  we could lose customers  which could lead to a loss of revenues 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the e commerce market  competition from other established and emerging companies may develop in the future 
many of our competitors may also have well established relationships with our existing and prospective customers 
increased competition is likely to result in fee reductions  reduced margins  longer sales cycles for our services and a decrease or loss of our market share  any of which could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
many of our competitors have  and new potential competitors may have  more experience developing internet based software applications and integrated purchasing solutions  larger technical staffs  larger customer bases  more established distribution channels  greater brand recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop products and services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater customer acceptance 
we cannot assure you that the e commerce solutions offered by our competitors now or in the future will not be perceived as superior to ours by either businesses or consumers 
our business will suffer if we are unable to attract  train or retain key personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  on attracting  training and retaining qualified management  marketing and technical personnel 
we do not know whether we will be successful in hiring  training or retaining qualified personnel 
the industry in which we compete has a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
in october  we implemented a workforce reduction in which we eliminated positions 
we experienced some attrition in personnel prior to and following the workforce reduction and we may experience additional attrition in the future 
our inability to hire and adequately train qualified personnel on a timely basis  or the departure of key employees  could harm our existing business and ability to expand our operations 
we may not be able to successfully expand in international markets 
a component of our strategy is to expand internationally by attracting customers outside the us for the year ended december   revenue under contracts with customers outside the us was less than of our total revenue 
we believe that significant opportunities exist in international markets  and it is our intention to compete in certain of these markets 
during  we opened offices in england  australia and germany 
we may expand our operations to serve other countries in the future 
expansion in our existing international markets and into new international markets requires significant management  financial  development  sales  marketing and other resources 
we have limited experience in localizing our services  and some of our competitors have expanded or are undertaking expansion into foreign markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in expanding in international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and expand our international presence  there are risks inherent in doing business internationally  including  among others different legal and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  fluctuating currency exchange rates  problems in collecting accounts receivable  legal uncertainty regarding liability  ownership and protection of intellectual property  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activity  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political instability 
any of the above factors could adversely affect the success of our international operations 
to the extent we expand our international operations  we will become more exposed to the above risks 
to the extent we have increasing portions of our revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we will become subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we cannot assure you that one or more of the factors discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our ability to expand our business and increase our revenue 
we may enter into strategic alliances or license technologies to expand our business or service offerings but may not be successful in doing so 
in addition to internal development of new technologies  our future success may depend to a certain degree on our ability to enter into and implement strategic alliances to expand our product and service offerings and our distribution channels and or to jointly market or gain market awareness for our service offerings 
for example  during the first quarter of we announced that we are expanding our auction service in the us to provide customers with the opportunity to list  manage and transact sales through ebay  with this offering expected to be available early in the second quarter of we may enter into similar relationships with other online service providers 
we may also expand our service offerings by licensing or purchasing complementary technologies from third parties 
for example  during the first quarter of we announced that we have licensed certain real time e business infrastructure software from tibco software inc to enable us to provide real time messaging infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying or developing such alliances and relationships or that such alliances and relationships will achieve their intended purposes 
we may acquire other businesses or technologies  which could result in dilution to our stockholders  or operational or integration difficulties which could impair our financial performance 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we may acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe will be useful in the growth of our business 
we do not currently have any commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition 
we may not be able to identify  negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully 
even if we do succeed in acquiring a business  technology  service or product  the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may require significant attention from our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we have not made any acquisitions  have no experience in integrating an acquisition into our business and may never achieve any of the benefits that we might anticipate from a future acquisition 
if we make future acquisitions  we may issue shares of stock that dilute other stockholders  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which might harm our financial results and cause our stock price to decline 
any financing that we might need for future acquisitions may only be available to us on terms that restrict our business or that impose on us costs that reduce our revenue 
our business may suffer if we are not able to protect important intellectual property 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our industry will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and systems designs 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
further  our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
we applied for patents on aspects of our technology and processes and those applications are pending with the us patent and trademark office 
we do not know whether any patents will be issued 
even if some or all of these patents are issued  we cannot assure you that they will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated  that they will adequately protect our technology and processes or that they will result in commercial advantages for us 
we have also applied for trademark registrations for some of our brand names and our marketing materials are copyrighted  but these protections may not be adequate 
effective patent  trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country where we provide services 
we may  at times  have to incur significant legal costs and spend time defending our copyrights and  if issued  our service marks and patents 
any defense efforts  whether successful or not  would divert both time and resources from the operation and growth of our business 
we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary knowledge 
we rely  in part  on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition by adversely affecting our ability to compete 
others may assert that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights 
we believe that our technology does not infringe the proprietary rights of others 
however  the e commerce industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and litigation based on allegations of patent infringement and violation of other intellectual property rights 
as the e commerce market and the functionality of products in the industry continues to grow and overlap  we believe that the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us will increase 
for example  we may inadvertently infringe a patent of which we are unaware  or there may be patent applications now pending of which we are unaware which we may be infringing when they are issued in the future  or our service or systems may incorporate third party technologies that infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we have been and expect to continue to be subject to alleged infringement claims 
the defense of any claims of infringement made against us by third parties  whether or not meritorious  could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time from our business operations 
either of these consequences of an infringement claim could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement  we may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay royalties to continue to use our technology 
we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or if these licenses are costly  our operating results may suffer either from reductions in revenues through our inability to serve customers or from increases in costs to license third party technologies 
our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to license software that is necessary for our service offering 
through distributors  we license a variety of commercially available microsoft technologies  including our database software and internet server software  which is used in our services and systems to perform key functions 
as a result  we are to a certain extent dependent upon microsoft continuing to maintain these technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by the microsoft technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of that functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our systems infrastructure may not keep pace with the demands of our customers 
interruptions of service as a result of a high volume of traffic and or transactions could diminish the attractiveness of our services and our ability to attract and retain customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our service  or that we will be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner 
we currently maintain separate systems in the us  england and australia  we plan to relocate our australia system to the us during the second quarter of any failure to expand or upgrade our systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing or interrupting revenue flow and by limiting our ability to attract new customers 
any such failure could also have a material adverse effect on the business of our customers  which could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability 
the majority of the server capacity of our systems for each of the countries named above is currently not utilized 
a system failure could cause delays or interruptions of service to our customers 
service offerings involving complex technology often contain errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial implementation of new services or enhancements to existing services 
although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before implementation  our systems are not error free 
errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or cancellation of customer agreements and may expose us to litigation and potential liability 
in the past  we have discovered errors in our software or software of others used in our operating systems after its incorporation into our systems 
we cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future services will not be discovered or that known errors considered minor by us will not be considered serious by our customers 
we have experienced periodic minor system interruptions  which may continue to occur from time to time 
most of our contracts provide for the payment or credit to the customer of specified money damages based on the monthly service fee paid by the customer if we are unable to maintain specified levels of service based on downtime of either their fairmarket hosted sites or our centralized service over a specified period  typically one month 
the total dollar amount of our potential payment or credit obligations under these provisions if the service levels specified in all of those agreements were not met over the typical one month measurement period could be material 
in addition  certain of our contracts also provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract if we are unable to maintain a minimum specified level of service 
performance problems in our technology could also damage our reputation which could reduce market acceptance of our services and lead to a loss of revenues 
the functioning of our systems or the systems of third parties on which we rely could be disrupted by factors outside our control 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems 
substantially all of our computer hardware for operating our us service is currently located at the facilities of navisite  inc in andover  massachusetts  and substantially all of our computer hardware for operating our australia and uk services are located at third party hosting centers in those countries 
we plan to relocate our australia system to navisite in the us during the second quarter of these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
we do not currently have a backup system in place for any given system  however  any one of our systems could temporarily be utilized as a backup system if a disaster should occur on any of our other systems 
despite any precautions we take or plan to take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at any third party hosting facility could result in interruptions in our services 
in addition  if any third party hosting service fails to provide the data communications capacity we require  as a result of human error  natural disaster or other operational disruption  interruptions in our service could result 
any damage to or failure of our systems could result in reductions in  or terminations of  our service  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business may suffer if buyers and sellers do not make payments or deliver goods 
our future success will depend to some extent upon sellers on customer sites reliably delivering and accurately representing their listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price 
our customers have received in the past  and we anticipate that they will receive in the future  communications from sellers and buyers who did not receive the purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged 
neither we nor our customers have the ability to require end users to make payments or deliver goods or otherwise make end users whole 
our customers also periodically receive complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we are unaware of any complaints that have materially impacted our customers businesses in a detrimental manner 
neither we nor our customers have the ability to determine the level of such complaints that are made directly between buyers and sellers 
we expect that both we and our customers will continue to receive requests from end users requesting reimbursement or threatening legal action against either our customers or us if no reimbursement is made 
we may have to monitor or control activities on customer sites 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of users of their services is currently unsettled in the us and in other countries 
our service automatically screens by key word all listings submitted by end users for pornographic material 
we also have notice and take down procedures related to infringing and illegal goods 
these procedures are not foolproof and goods that may be subject to regulation by us local  state or federal authorities or local foreign authorities could be sold through our service 
these goods include  for example  firearms  alcohol and tobacco 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent the unlawful exchange of goods on our service or that we will successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service 
the potential imposition of liability for unlawful activities of end users of our customers could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require us  among other things  to spend substantial resources and or to discontinue one or more of our service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of such liability or asserted liability would harm our results of operations 
future government regulation of auctions and auctioneers may add to our operating costs 
numerous us jurisdictions have laws and regulations regarding the conduct of auctions and the liability of auctioneers  which were enacted for consumer protection many years ago 
we believe that the us laws and regulations do not apply to our online auction services 
however  little precedent exists in this area  and one or more jurisdictions in the us or in other countries in which we do business are attempting or may attempt to impose these laws and regulations to online auction providers and may attempt to impose these laws and regulations on our operations or the operations of our customers in the future 
certain states are currently considering whether to apply their auctioneer regulations to online auctions and at least one state has recently passed legislation that applies to the conduct of all auctions  including auctions conducted over the internet 
if any such statute or regulation is interpreted to apply to us or to our customers  we and or those of our customers to whom the statute applies could be required to obtain a state license 
this could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers  could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing activity on our customers auction sites and could subject us or our customers to fines if we or our customers are unable to obtain the required licenses 
in addition  as the nature of the products listed by our customers or their end users changes  we may become subject to new regulatory restrictions 
if we do become subject to these laws and regulations in the future  it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing activity on our customers auction sites 
risks related to our industry our success depends on the continued growth of the internet and online commerce 
our future revenues and profits depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet and other online services as a medium for commerce by merchants and consumers 
the use of the internet and e commerce may not continue to develop at past rates and a sufficiently broad base of business and individual customers may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of commerce 
the market for the sale of goods and services over the internet is an emerging market 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
growth in our customer base depends on obtaining businesses and consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods 
for us to be successful  these market participants must accept and use novel ways of conducting business and exchanging information 
e commerce may not prove to be a viable medium for purchasing for the following reasons  any of which could seriously harm our business the necessary infrastructure for internet communications may not develop adequately  our potential customers  buyers and suppliers may have security and confidentiality concerns  complementary products  such as high speed modems and high speed communication lines  may not be developed  alternative purchasing solutions may be implemented  buyers may dislike the reduction in the human contact inherent in traditional purchasing methods  use of the internet and other online services may not continue to increase or may increase more slowly than expected  the development or adoption of new technology standards and protocols may be delayed or may not occur  and new and burdensome governmental regulations may be imposed 
our success depends on the continued reliability of the internet 
the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users  frequency of use and bandwidth requirements 
there can be no assurance that the infrastructure of the internet and other online services will be able to support the demands placed upon them 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and could face such outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could adversely affect the level of internet usage and also the level of traffic and the processing of transactions 
in addition  the internet or other online services could lose their viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet or other online service activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services or other internet service providers to support the internet or other online services also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the internet and other online services generally and our service in particular 
if use of the internet and other online services does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  if the infrastructure of the internet and other online services does not effectively support growth that may occur  or if the internet and other online services do not become a viable commercial marketplace  we will have to adapt our business model to the new environment  which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation of the internet may impede our growth or add to our operating costs 
like many internet based businesses  we operate in an environment of tremendous uncertainty as to potential government regulation 
the internet has rapidly emerged as a commerce medium  and governmental agencies have not yet been able to adapt all existing regulations to the internet environment 
laws and regulations have been introduced or are under consideration and court decisions have been or may be reached in the us and other countries in which we do business that affect the internet or other online services  covering issues such as pricing  user privacy  freedom of expression  access charges  content and quality of products and services  advertising  intellectual property rights and information security 
in addition  it is uncertain how existing laws governing issues such as taxation  property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  libel  obscenity and personal privacy will be applied to the internet 
the majority of these laws were adopted prior to the introduction of the internet and  as a result  do not address the unique issues of the internet 
recent laws that contemplate the internet  such as the digital millennium copyright act in the us  have not yet been fully interpreted by the courts and their applicability is therefore uncertain 
the digital millennium copyright act provides certain safe harbors that limit the risk of copyright infringement liability for service providers such as fairmarket with respect to infringing activities engaged in by users of the service  such as end users of our customers auction sites 
we have adopted and are further refining our policies and practices to qualify for one or more of these safe harbors  but we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful since the digital millennium copyright act has not been fully interpreted by the courts and its interpretation is therefore uncertain 
similarly  the recently enacted online services act in australia and the internet watch foundation in the uk a body funded by internet service providers  the uk government and uk law enforcement agencies provide or operate notice and take down procedures with respect to certain types of content  but the extent  if any  to which those procedures provide a safe harbor is uncertain 
in the area of user privacy  several states have proposed legislation that would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies 
the federal trade commission also has become increasingly involved in this area  and recently settled an action with one online service regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties 
the recently adopted european union directive on the protection of personal data may affect our ability to expand in europe if we or our customers do not afford adequate privacy to end users of our customers sites 
similar legislation was recently passed in canada and australia and may have a similar effect 
the canadian law will be implemented in stages over the next few years  while the australian amendment privacy sector act becomes effective in december  with an additional months extended to small businesses 
we do not sell personal user information from our customers sites 
as between fairmarket and our customers  the personal user information belongs to the customer  not fairmarket  and each site is governed by the respective customer s own privacy policy 
we do use aggregated data for analyses regarding the fairmarket network  and do use personal user information in the performance of our services for our customers 
since we do not control what our customers do with the personal user information they collect  we cannot assure you that our customers sites will be considered compliant 
as online commerce evolves  we expect that federal  state or foreign agencies will adopt regulations covering issues such as pricing  content  user privacy  and quality of products and services 
any future regulation may have a negative impact on our business by restricting our methods of operation or imposing additional costs 
although many of these regulations may not apply to our business directly  we anticipate that laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal information could indirectly affect our business 
title v of the telecommunications act of  known as the communications decency act of  prohibits the knowing transmission of any comment  request  suggestion  proposal  image or other communication that is obscene or pornographic to any recipient under the age of the prohibition s scope and the liability associated with a violation are currently unsettled 
in addition  although substantial portions of the communications decency act of have been held to be unconstitutional  we cannot be certain that similar legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the future 
it is possible that such legislation could expose companies involved in online commerce to liability  which could limit the growth of online commerce generally 
legislation like the communications decency act could reduce the growth in internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commerce medium 
the worldwide availability of internet web sites often results in sales of goods to buyers outside the jurisdiction in which we or our customers are located  and foreign jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws 
as an internet company  it is unclear which jurisdictions may find that we are conducting business therein 
our failure to qualify to do business in a jurisdiction that requires us to do so could subject us to fines or penalties and could result in our inability to enforce contracts in that jurisdiction 
new taxes may be imposed on internet commerce 
in the us  we do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods sold by customers and users through customers fairmarket powered sites or service taxes on fees paid by end users of those sites 
the internet tax freedom act of  which expires on october   prohibits the imposition of taxes on internet access services and new taxes on electronic commerce by us federal and state taxing authorities 
however  after the expiration of the internet tax freedom act  one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out of state companies which engage in or facilitate online commerce  and a number of proposals have been made at the state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
such proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce  and could adversely affect our opportunity to derive financial benefit from such activities 
many non us countries impose service tax such as value added tax collection obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate internet commerce 
we do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods sold by customers and or users of our customers sites in australia or the uk however  we have modified our systems in each of those countries to enable value added or goods and services taxes to be charged and collected with respect to site usage fees 
a successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that we or our customers should collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of merchandise or  in the us  site usage fees or that we or our customers should collect internet based taxes could impair our revenue and our ability to acquire and retain customers 
there may be significant security risks and privacy concerns relating to online commerce 
a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
a compromise or breach of the technology used to protect our customers and their end users transaction data could result from  among other things  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments 
any such compromise could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and  therefore  on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
in april  unauthorized persons gained access to the www 
fairmarket 
com web site and replaced the home page with a web page of their own 
there was no compromise of our operating system 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and other online services and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
we currently have practices and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of our customers and their end users information 
however  our security procedures to protect against the risk of inadvertent disclosure or intentional breaches of security might fail to adequately protect information that we are obligated to keep confidential 
we may not be successful in adopting more effective systems for maintaining confidential information  and our exposure to the risk of disclosure of the confidential information of others may grow with increases in the amount of information we possess 
to the extent that our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
we could be subject to potential product liability claims and third party liability claims related to products and services purchased through our customers sites 
any errors  defects or other performance problems in our services and systems could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
although our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for problems related to the products and services sold on customer sites 
even if we are successful  any such claims or litigation could still require expenditure of management time and other resources to defend ourselves 
liability of this sort could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability  which may require us  among other things  to expend substantial resources or to discontinue service offerings or to take precautions to ensure that products and services are not available on customer sites 
moreover  deliveries of products purchased on customer sites that are nonconforming  late or are not accompanied by information required by applicable law or regulations  could expose us to liability or result in decreased adoption and use of those sites and therefore our services  which would lead to decreased revenue 
our stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the stock market  and in particular the market for internet related stocks  has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially  including failure to meet our development plans  the demand for our common stock  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  and investor perception of our industry or our prospects 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
a substantial portion of our common stock is held by a small number of investors and can be resold or is subject to registration rights 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that a large number of shares are available for sale  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition to the adverse effect a price decline could have on holders of our common stock  such a decline would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities 
the holders of a substantial portion of our common stock including at least approximately million shares held by former holders of our series c and d convertible preferred stock and approximately million shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants have rights  subject to some conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering their shares  or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for fairmarket or other stockholders 
by exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares  these holders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
furthermore  if we were to include in a fairmarket initiated registration statement shares held by those holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights  those sales could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments for investment purposes and only invest in financial instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
this policy also limits the amount of credit exposure of any one issue  issuer  and type of investment 
due to the conservative nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk international sales are made mostly from fairmarket s foreign sales subsidiaries in the respective countries and are denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
fairmarket is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall financial results 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on fairmarket in the year ended december  was not significant
