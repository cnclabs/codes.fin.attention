these risks and uncertainties are detailed throughout the report and will be further discussed from time to time in the company s periodic reports filed with the commission 
the forward looking statements included in the report speak only as of the date hereof 
at the beginning of last year  we embarked upon an expansion plan that was designed to significantly increase the revenue from our construction materials operations compared to while revenue from this business increased for  and represented of our total revenue for the year  this was below our expectations 
this was primarily because of start up issues in several of our new locations in arizona and nevada  including permitting delays and adverse weather conditions 
we still were able to accomplish a great deal that we expect to contribute to improved results in the future 
during  we brought into operation our ready mix concrete batch plant in henderson  nevada  which gives the company two operating plants and a fleet of ready mix trucks in the las vegas area 
we also finalized our property lease and aggregate supply agreements and erected two ready mix concrete plants in the phoenix  arizona area and we are currently running ready mix trucks out of the two phoenix locations 
we also successfully completed the installation of our crushing and screening operations in a quarry at prescott valley  arizona and an aggregate pit in chino valley  arizona 
in addition  we completed the pit improvements and installation of our crushing  screening and wash plant in our aggregate pit in nephi  utah 
as a result of these major accomplishments in  we expect revenue from our construction materials operations to approximately double in longer term  it remains our objective to generate approximately one third of our total revenue from sales of construction materials and two thirds from heavy construction contracts 
we expected our heavy construction operations to earn substantial profits for during the start up phase of the construction materials expansion program 
our construction operations in nevada  arizona and utah met our profit plan for the year 
results in our nevada area operations were particularly outstanding 
however  our new mexico operations reported a net loss of million  offsetting the profits earned elsewhere 
in  meadow valley was the low bidder and was awarded contracts by the new mexico state highway and transportation department nmshtd on several projects in the ruidoso and alamogordo areas that totaled in excess of million 
the technical difficulties and issues we encountered on these projects were similar to those routinely encountered on other highway construction projects in other states 
but the difference in new mexico was the magnitude of the deficiencies and the ambivalence of the nmshtd in solving the problems actually caused by factors completely within their control accuracy of plan documents and design  advance location and relocation of utilities  site conditions and related geotechnical information  right of way issues  resultant delays  numerous changes and weather impacts resulting from the delays  etc the problems stem from nmshtd s inability or unwillingness to accept responsibility for the cost and time impacts that resulted from nmshtd s acts and omissions  defective design documents and numerous modifications to our contracts 
we are proud of the company s long history of working with project owners to resolve construction related problems or contract disputes and have earned numerous awards for our cooperative and problem solving nature 
our success in every other state speaks volumes 
what has occurred in new mexico is not characteristic of our company but more reflective of the competence and atmosphere in new mexico 
under the terms of our contracts with the nmshtd  when we incur costs that we believe are compensable  our only recourse is to notify the nmshtd of our intent to submit a claim to recover such costs 
as a prime contractor or a subcontractor  we have submitted a number of claims for compensable costs to the nmshtd that to date approximate million 
of that amount  approximately million pertains solely to meadow valley 
to date we have booked slightly more than million of anticipated claim revenue out of the million to offset a portion of those costs 
the million represents a conservative approach to the accounting of these claims at this time and is not reflective of the merits of the individual claims 
we are aggressively pursuing our claims against the nmshtd  although we cannot estimate when or how claims may be resolved 
if the claims are rejected  the company could experience an adverse financial impact

million for liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for capital has been to finance growth in its core business as a heavy construction contractor and its expansion into the other construction and construction related businesses previously discussed 
historically  the company s primary source of cash has been from operations 
the company s expansion into construction materials has required capital to finance expanded receivables  increased inventories and capital expenditures as well as to address fluctuations in the work in progress billing cycle 
the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain items from the statements of cash flows of the company 
for the years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities    cash provided by used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities    although the company may experience increased profitability as the company expands its operations  particularly its aggregate  ready mix concrete and asphalt production  cash may be used to finance receivables  build inventories and for customer cash retention required under contracts subject to completion 
it is not unusual for cash flows from construction projects nearing the final stages of completion to have negative cash flows 
the recent completion of several large projects combined with claim related costs expended on projects and the start up costs of the business expansion have resulted in a significant decline in the company s cash reserves 
accordingly  during the year ended december   the company entered into a revolving loan agreement line of credit 
under the terms of the agreement  the company may borrow  at chase manhattan bank s prime  plus through december  the line of credit is secured by all of the company s assets

at december   the company is in compliance with all covenants under the line of credit 
the line of credit expires december  at which time the line of credit converts to a term agreement requiring monthly principal and interest payments through december  the company believes the line of credit  together with the company s historical ability to acquire new work may be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the next twelve months 
as of december   the company had withdrawn  from the line of credit 
as of march   the company had withdrawn an additional  from the line of credit

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as amended by fas no 
and fas no 
fas requires the company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value commencing with the first quarter of changes in derivative fair values will either be recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of related hedged assets  liabilities and firm commitments or  for forecasted transactions  deferred and recorded as a component of stockholders equity until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
based on our current analysis  fas will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
is applicable beginning with our fourth quarter fiscal consolidated financial statements 
based on our current analysis of sab no 
 management does not believe it will have a material impact on the financial results of the company

 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  the interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
the interpretation is intended to clarify certain problems that have arisen in practice since the issuance of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the effective date of the interpretation was july  the provisions of the interpretation apply prospectively  but they will also cover certain events occurring after december  and after january  the company believes the adoption of fin has not had a material adverse affect on the current and historical consolidated financial statements 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies subject to the company s profitability and increases in retained earnings  it is anticipated that its bonding limits will increase proportionately  thereby allowing the company to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
the company believes that government at all levels will continue to be the primary source of funding for infrastructure work 
the national transportation legislation  tea  establishes a total budget authority of billion over the six year period tea ensures that tax revenue deposited into the highway trust fund will be spent on transportation improvements by guaranteeing billion for highways and billion for transit and by further stipulating that appropriators can spend trust fund dollars only on transportation 
annual spending authorizations under tea have been consistent anticipated levels  however  since the beginning of tea  the amount of funds actually reaching the construction phase has been slowed by bureaucratic  design and environmental bottlenecks 
it is expected that the flow of tea funds will be seen more noticeably beginning in see market overview 
the competitive bidding process will continue to be the dominant method for determining contract award 
however  other innovative bidding methods will be tried and may gain favor  namely a plus b contracts  where the bidders proposals are selected on both price and scheduling criteria 
design build projects are becoming more common and are likely to increase in frequency 
design build projects also tend to be of more worth to the owner when the contract size is substantial  usually million or more 
in light of the rising needs for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current needs to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
there is also trend toward local and state legislation regulating growth and urban sprawl 
the passage of such legislation and the degree of growth limits imposed by it could dramatically affect the nature of the company s markets 
seasonality the construction industry is seasonal  generally due to inclement weather occurring in the winter months 
accordingly  the company may experience a seasonal pattern in its operating results with lower revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year than other quarters 
quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of bid solicitations by governmental authorities  the stage of completion of major projects and revenue recognition policies 
results for any one quarter  therefore  may not be indicative of results for other quarters or for the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company does not have foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price market risk 
interest rate risk from time to time the company temporarily invests its excess cash and restricted cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
the company s management monitors risk exposure to monies invested in securities of any one financial institution 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to the company 
the company s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to the company s long term debt obligations 
the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of its interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a basis point increase in the prime interest rate at december  the potential increase in the fair value of the company s debt obligations would have been approximately  at december  see note and in the accompanying consolidated financial statement
