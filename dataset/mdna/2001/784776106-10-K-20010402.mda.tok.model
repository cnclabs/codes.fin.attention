 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to avoid the risk of fluctuating exchange rates associated with international sales  the company conducts most international sales in united states currency 
however  prior to the devaluation of the brazilian currency in january the company had generated a significant portion of its brazilian revenue in the local currency of brazil 
while the contracts relating to such arrangements generally contained provisions that called for payments to be adjusted to take into account fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company s customers in brazil expressed an unwillingness to fully adjust contract amounts to fully reflect some of the exchange rate fluctuations 
brazilian counsel advised the company that there was uncertainty as to the enforceability of provisions  which tie payments to foreign currency rates 
the company  therefore  whenever possible  negotiates sales to brazilian customers in us dollars to avoid any uncertainty as to the value of receivables 
the company does not use derivatives to manage any foreign currency exposures 
the company s exposure to market risk is mainly comprised of interest rate risk and credit risk related to its short term investments  which are primarily invested in variable rate instruments 
the company addresses these risks by monitoring credit quality standards and maturity dates of investments 
the company s exposure to market risk is not expected to be material 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s exposure to short term interest rate fluctuations is limited to its short term borrowings under its line of credit for  such line of credit allows borrowings up to  and therefore a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by
