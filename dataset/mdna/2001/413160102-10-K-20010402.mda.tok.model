item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and markets digital and fiber optic systems for delivering video  voice and data services over cable  satellite and wireless networks 
historically  almost all of our sales were derived directly or indirectly from sales of fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators 
with the introduction of our transend digital headend products in and the subsequent purchase of new media communication ltd 
nmc  which changed its name to harmonic data systems ltd  we broadened our product offering to enable delivery of digital video  voice and data over satellite and wireless networks and cable systems 
in order to further expand our digital systems capability  the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with c cube microsystems  inc c cube  pursuant to which c cube merged into harmonic the merger agreement 
under the terms of the merger agreement  c cube spun off its semiconductor business as a separate publicly traded company 
c cube then merged into harmonic and harmonic therefore acquired c cube s divicom business  which provides mpeg encoding products and systems for digital television the merger was structured as a tax free exchange of stock and has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in the merger  each share of common stock of c cube was converted into shares of harmonic common stock 
the purchase price  including merger related costs  was approximately billion 
the merger closed on may   and harmonic has consolidated the results of the divicom business in its financial statements from that date forward 
the merged company has been organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks ban for fiber optic systems and convergent systems cs for digital headend systems 
while the two divisions have been organized generally around the pre merger harmonic fiber optics systems and the divicom digital headend systems  respectively  these divisions do not correspond to the pre merger companies in significant ways 
for example  harmonic s transend and cyberstream product lines are now part of the cs division 
each of these divisions has its own separate management team  with a worldwide sales and professional services and system support group supporting both divisions 
to date  a substantial majority of harmonic s net sales have been to relatively few customers  and harmonic expects this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
in  sales to at t accounted for of net sales compared to and in and  respectively 
in addition  in  rcn represented of net sales 
in  sales to star electronics  a chinese distributor  accounted for of net sales 
harmonic s net sales increased in due principally to inclusion of sales from divicom 
ban sales were essentially unchanged in compared to  but decreased sequentially in each of the last three quarters and were lower in the second half of than in the first half of this was due primarily to lower cable industry spending and significantly reduced sales to at t  which continued to decline from record levels in the third quarter of cs sales in  consisting principally of divicom products  were below divicom s sales levels in and were significantly below our expectations at the time the divicom merger was announced in october the lower cs sales were attributable principally to reduced spending by satellite operators and in part to the impact of changes in our sales organization resulting from the merger 
the company expects cable and satellite industry spending to remain weak at least through the first half of major customers  including at t  rcn and bell south have imposed shipment holds or cancelled or delayed orders with harmonic and other vendors or announced plans to reduce capital spending this year 
the factors contributing to this slow down in capital spending include uncertain worldwide economic conditions  reduced access to capital markets for certain new and existing customers and inventory levels held by some operators in excess of current deployment requirements 
while harmonic is unable to predict if sales will continue to decline or when sales will increase  the company has recently implemented cost control measures  including a reduction in the work force of approximately in february in spite of these measures  the company expects to continue to report losses  excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and goodwill  for at least the first two quarters of  and can not predict when or if it will return to profitability 
in  and  sales of ban products accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of net sales while cs products accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of net sales 
cs sales prior to the merger consisted of sales of harmonic s transend and cyberstream product lines 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales are generally recognized upon shipment  and reserves are provided for estimated returns  discounts and warranties 
such reserves are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
revenue on solution sales is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor costs expended to date to anticipated final labor costs  based on current estimates of labor costs to complete the project 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
revenue from services is generally recognized as services are performed 
maintenance services are recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which is typically one year 
harmonic often recognizes a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected levels of future sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on operating results may be magnified by harmonic s inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of these and other factors  harmonic s operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
due to lower than expected sales to at t and lower than expected sales in the cs division during the second quarter of  and lower than expected sales in the ban division in the third and fourth quarters of  we failed to meet our internal expectations  as well as the expectations of securities analysts and investors during the second  third and fourth quarters of  and the price of our common stock declined significantly 
see factors that may affect our future operations our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
as of december   the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately billion to write down the goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of the divicom business completed in may divicom was acquired in a tax free exchange of stock at a time when the market values of telecommunications equipment manufacturers were substantially higher 
the divicom business has experienced a significant decrease in the demand for its products and services as customers in the digital headend systems market reduced levels of current and planned capital expenditures and  as a result  revenues  cash flows and expected future growth rates have decreased 
due to these significant changes  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the goodwill and other long lived assets related to the divicom business in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
because the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of this operation was less than the carrying value of the related goodwill  an impairment charge was recorded 
the impairment charge represents the amount required to write down long lived assets to management s best estimate of this operation s future discounted cash flows 
as a result of the impairment charge  the company wrote off the remaining unamortized goodwill and reduced the recorded value of other identified intangibles related to its acquisition of the divicom business to million  which will be amortized over a remaining useful life of approximately four years 
results of operations harmonic s historical consolidated statements of operations data for each of the three years ended december    and as a percentage of net sales  are as follows fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in process technology total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net sales the company s net sales increased to million in  from million in the increase in net sales was due to higher cs division sales primarily attributable to inclusion of sales from the divicom business  as well as higher unit sales of transend and cyberstream 
ban division sales were essentially unchanged in compared to  as higher unit sales of pwrblazer scalable nodes were offset by lower unit sales of metrolink dwdm systems and lower selling prices 
ban sales decreased sequentially in each of the last three quarters of and were lower in the second half of than in the first half of this was due primarily to lower cable industry spending and significantly reduced sales to at t  which continued to decline from record levels in the third quarter of international sales represented of net sales in compared to in due to unusually high domestic sales in and a higher international sales mix of the former divicom business 
net sales increased to million in  from million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher unit sales of metrolink dwdm systems and pwrblazer scalable nodes  which began volume shipment during the middle of  and  to a lesser extent  higher unit sales of existing products partially offset by lower selling prices 
the increase was also attributable to increased spending by domestic and international customers 
during domestic sales increased by  principally due to increased shipments to at t 
at t represented of net sales during compared to of net sales in international sales increased during compared to  primarily due to higher shipments to canada and the united kingdom 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profit in ban which was partially offset by the inclusion of the divicom business 
the significant decrease in gross margins was due to lower margins within each business segment 
ban margins decreased primarily due to a less favorable product mix which included a higher percentage of node products  lower fixed cost absorption due to lower than expected production volumes and a significant increase in inventory provisions 
a substantial amount of these inventory provisions were recorded in the fourth quarter of  due to recent downward reductions in internal sales forecasts as a result of the slowdown in the economy and in capital spending by many of our customers 
cs margins decreased principally due to high fixed costs of the professional services and integration operations  and lower pricing 
in addition  gross profits and gross margins in were reduced by million or due to amortization of intangibles related to the divicom acquisition and  to a significantly lesser extent  the cogent acquisition 
gross profit increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increases in gross profit and gross margin were principally due to higher unit volumes  which allowed the company to improve fixed cost absorption and realize increased economies of scale through higher production and purchasing volumes  as well as a more favorable product mix  which included a higher percentage of transmitters 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increases in were due principally to the inclusion of divicom  which historically has spent a higher percentage of net sales on research and development than has harmonic  and higher payroll and prototype expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute spending was principally attributable to higher headcount  consulting expenses and prototype expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was principally attributable to increased net sales 
harmonic anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase in due to the inclusion of divicom for the entire year 
sales  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increases in were primarily due to inclusion of divicom  as well as higher payroll  consulting and recruiting expenses associated with expansion of the sales  marketing and administrative organizations to provide greater customer focus and new product support  and to support the company s overall growth in headcount and operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to higher headcount and costs associated with expansion of the sales and marketing organizations to provide wider geographic coverage and support for new products  as well as higher sales commissions related to increased net sales 
in addition  higher personnel  consulting and recruiting expenses associated with supporting the company s overall growth in headcount and operations contributed to the increase 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was principally attributable to increased net sales 
harmonic expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in due to the inclusion of divicom for the entire year 
goodwill  other intangibles and impairment goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately billion were recorded in connection with the c cube merger and cogent acquisition  resulting in amortization of million for as of december   the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately billion to write down the goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of the divicom business completed in may see md a overview and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining goodwill and other intangibles will be amortized over approximately four years 
in process research and development the company recorded one time charges totaling million to operations in for acquired in process technology in connection with the c cube merger and cogent acquisition 
in the company recorded a one time charge of million to operations for acquired in process technology in connection with the nmc acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in  million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to interest earned on cash received in the merger  and to a lesser extent  interest earned on cash proceeds resulting from the company s public offering of common stock in april the majority of the cash received in the merger was used on august  to pay taxes incurred on the spin off of c cube s semiconductor business 
the increase in was due primarily to interest earned on cash proceeds from the company s april stock offering 
the company expects interest income to be comparable to the level in future periods 
income taxes the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of only million in principally because of non deductible goodwill impairment and amortization  and acquired in process technology related to the acquisition of divicom 
the underlying effective rate before goodwill impairment and amortization  and acquired in process technology was approximately in the provision for income taxes for was based on an estimated annual tax rate of 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for due to the net loss incurred 
in  the company expects to have an effective annual federal and state rate of zero  with minimal foreign income taxes 
see factors that may affect future results of operations we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
harmonic received million of cash under the terms of the merger agreement and additional cash of approximately million at the time of the merger for the estimated tax liability related to the spin off of c cube s semiconductor business and for other tax liabilities that harmonic assumed 
the company paid the estimated tax liability related to the spin off on august  in addition  the company completed a public offering of its common stock in april  raising approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
the company also received million from exercise of a warrant in connection with the public offering and million from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash used in operations in  excluding the spin tax payment of million  was million compared to cash provided by operations of million in the increase in cash used in operations in  excluding the spin tax payment  was primarily due to an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
during  the company had a bank line of credit facility which expired on december  and provided for borrowings of up to million with a million secured equipment term loan sub limit 
there were no outstanding borrowings at december  under the line 
in march  the company finalized renegotiation of its credit facility 
the new facility provides for borrowings of up to million with a million secured equipment term loan sub limit 
this new line contains certain financial and other covenants and expires in february borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate prime rate plus under the term loan and are payable monthly 
additions to property  plant and equipment were approximately million during compared to million in the million increase in was due principally to higher expenditures for manufacturing  test and computer equipment due in part to the inclusion of divicom 
in addition  the company had two major capital programs in process at december  associated with integration of the divicom business 
these programs consist of leasehold improvements and related furniture  fixtures and equipment in connection with relocation of employees to new facilities  and the purchase and implementation of the company s new enterprise resources planning erp software system 
the company spent approximately million on these programs in and is committed to spend approximately million in  primarily in the first and second quarters  to complete these programs 
harmonic currently expects total capital expenditures to be million in while the company expects to continue to report losses  excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  for at least the first two quarters of  and currently expects total capital expenditures of million in  it believes that its existing liquidity sources  including its bank line of credit facility  will satisfy its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
see factors that may affect future results of operations we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
factors that may affect future results of operations our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and a quarterly basis  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level and timing of capital spending of our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  the timing and amount of customer orders  the timing of revenue from systems contracts which may span several quarters  competitive market conditions  our unpredictable sales cycles  our ability to integrate the acquired divicom business into harmonic s operations  new product introductions by our competitors or by us  changes in domestic and international regulatory environments  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  subassemblies and modules  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of our products sold  our development of custom products and software  the level of international sales  and economic conditions specific to the cable and satellite industries  and general economic conditions 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of all these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
in this regard  due to lower than expected sales to at t and lower than expected sales in the cs segment during the second quarter  and lower than expected sales in the ban segment in the third and fourth quarters  we failed to meet our internal expectations  as well as the expectations of securities analysts and investors during the second  third and fourth quarters of  and the price of our common stock declined significantly 
we depend on cable and satellite industry capital spending for a substantial portion of our revenue and any decrease or delay in capital spending in these industries would negatively impact our resources  operating results and financial condition 
prior to the merger with c cube  almost all of harmonic s historic sales had been derived from sales to cable television operators and broadcasters  and it expects these sales to constitute a majority of net sales for the foreseeable future 
almost all of the divicom business historic sales have been derived from sales to satellite operators  telephone companies and cable operators 
demand for the combined company s products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators  broadcasters  satellite operators and telephone companies for constructing and upgrading of their systems 
these capital spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors  including access to financing  annual budget cycles  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications and television broadcasting  overall demand for communication services and the acceptance of new video  voice and data services  evolving industry standards and network architectures  competitive pressures  discretionary customer spending patterns  general economic conditions 
in the past  specific factors contributing to reduced capital spending have included uncertainty related to development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operators  emphasis on marketing and customer service strategies by cable television operators instead of construction of networks  and general economic conditions in domestic and international markets 
recent developments in capital markets have reduced access to funding for new and existing customers causing delays in the timing and scale of deployments of our equipment  as well as the postponement of certain projects by our customers 
in addition  harmonic and other vendors have received notification from major customers  including at t  rcn and bell south that they are imposing shipment holds  canceling new projects  or delaying new orders to allow them to reduce inventory levels which are in excess of their current deployment requirements 
the timing of deployment of our equipment can be subject to a number of other risks  including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel  the availability of other equipment such as fiber optic cable  and the need for local zoning and licensing approvals 
we believe that changes in our customers deployment plans have in recent quarters delayed  and may in the future delay  the receipt of new orders or the release of existing backlog 
since the majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers  a delay in equipment deployment at any one customer has in the past and could have a material adverse effect on our sales in a particular quarter 
in this regard  the company s sales decreased in each of the last two quarters and were below our expectations in the ban and cs segments 
ban sales decreased sequentially in each of the last three quarters of and were lower in the second half of than in the first half of this was due primarily to lower cable industry spending and significantly reduced sales to at t which continued to decline from record levels in the third quarter of for a more detailed discussion regarding risks related to at t and other major customers  see our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
the loss of at t or any other key customer would have a negative effect on our business below 
cs sales in  consisting principally of divicom products  were below divicom s sales levels in and were significantly below our expectations at the time the divicom merger was announced in october the lower cs sales were attributable principally to reduced spending by satellite operators and in part to the impact of changes in our sales organization resulting from the merger 
the company expects cable and satellite industry spending to remain weak at least through the first half of  and harmonic is unable to predict if sales will continue to decline or if sales will increase 
the company expects to continue to report losses  excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and goodwill  for at least the first two quarters of  and cannot predict when or if it will return to profitability 
further  cable television capital spending can be subject to the effects of seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
the loss of at t or any other key customer would have a negative effect on our business 
historically  a significant majority of our sales and sales of divicom have been to relatively few customers 
sales to harmonic s ten largest customers in  and accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
due in part to the consolidation of ownership of domestic cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales of the combined company for the foreseeable future 
sales to at t and rcn accounted for and of our net sales in in  sales to at t accounted for of our net sales and have declined as a percentage of net sales in each quarter since the third quarter of we cannot assure you that sales to other customers will compensate for any further reduction in sales to at t nor can we predict the impact of restructuring plans recently announced by at t on our future sales to at t 
almost all of our sales are made on a purchase order or system contract basis  and none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would harm our business 
we may experience continuing difficulties integrating the divicom business 
in addition to the risks generally associated with acquisitions  there are a number of significant risks directly associated with our merger with divicom 
in order to derive the expected benefits of the merger  the two companies must complete the integration of the companies product offerings  coordinate research and development and sales and marketing efforts  and complete the implementation of facilities moves and common information systems 
the diversion of the attention of management from the day to day operations of the combined company  or difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
the process of combining the organizations has caused interruption of  and a loss of momentum in  certain of our business activities 
in addition  we have experienced the loss of certain key employees since the merger  principally due to intense competition for qualified technical and other personnel in the san francisco bay area 
we cannot assure you that disruptions associated with the divicom acquisition  including the loss of key personnel  will not continue to adversely affect our business and operating results 
we depend on our international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our operating results 
sales to customers outside of the united states in   and represented  and  of net sales  respectively  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
while our international sales are typically denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
furthermore  payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
unpredictable sales cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period 
in addition  foreign markets may not develop in the future 
we must be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
from time to time  we receive indications from our customers as to their future plans and requirements to ensure that we will be prepared to meet their demand for our products 
if actual orders differ materially from these indications  our ability to manage inventory and expenses may be affected 
in addition  if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we enter into purchase commitments to acquire materials  acquire materials or manufacture products or otherwise expend resources  and such products are not purchased by our customers  our business and operating results could suffer 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and many of our competitors are larger and more established 
the markets for cable television fiber optics systems and digital video broadcasting systems are extremely competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change and declining average selling prices 
harmonic s competitors in the cable television fiber optics systems business include significantly larger corporations such as adc telecommunications  antec a company owned in part by at t  motorola  philips and scientific atlanta 
in the digital and video broadcasting systems business  we compete broadly with vertically integrated system suppliers including motorola  scientific atlanta  tandberg  thomson broadcast systems and philips  and in certain product lines with cisco systems  skystream and terayon 
most of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than harmonic 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in these markets 
they often have broader product lines and market focus and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market 
in addition  many of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have and therefore have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 
if any of our competitors products or technologies were to become the industry standard  our business could be seriously harmed 
for example  us cable operators have to date mostly purchased proprietary digital systems from motorola and scientific atlanta 
while certain operators have made limited purchases of the open systems provided by harmonic  we cannot assure you that our digital products will find broad market acceptance with us cable operators 
in addition  companies that have historically not had a large presence in the broadband communications equipment market have begun recently to expand their market share through mergers and acquisitions 
the continued consolidation of our competitors could have a significant negative impact on us 
further  our competitors  particularly competitors of our digital and video broadcasting systems business  may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or which may require us to lower our selling prices resulting in lower gross margins 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature and characterized by rapid technological change 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature  making it difficult to accurately predict the markets future growth rates  sizes or technological directions 
in view of the evolving nature of these markets  it is possible that cable television operators  telephone companies or other suppliers of broadband wireless and satellite services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business will suffer 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
broadband communications markets are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products  if our products are not cost effective  are not brought to market in a timely manner  are not in accordance with evolving industry standards and architectures  or fail to achieve market acceptance 
in addition  to successfully develop and market our planned products for digital applications  we will be required to retain and attract new personnel with experience and expertise in the digital arena 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in retaining and attracting qualified personnel 
also  to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements when necessary could limit our ability to develop and market new products and  accordingly  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we need to effectively manage our operations and the cyclical nature of our business the growth of our operations and cyclical nature of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management and other resources 
this strain has been exacerbated by the acquisition of divicom and the subsequent loss of numerous employees  including senior management 
in addition  in february  we reduced our work force by approximately due to reduced industry spending and demand for our products 
our ability to manage our business effectively in the future  including any future growth  will require us to train  motivate and manage our employees successfully  to attract and integrate new employees  including our new chief operating officer  michael moone  into our overall operations  to retain key employees and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
in particular  we expect to shortly implement a new management information system 
we believe this new system will significantly affect many aspects of our business  including accounting  manufacturing operations  purchasing  sales and marketing functions 
the successful implementation of this system is expected to be critical to our business 
there can be no assurance that we will implement the new system in an efficient  cost effective or timely manner or that the new information system will be adequate to support our operations 
if we fail to manage our existing operations or any future growth effectively  our business could suffer 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high caliber personnel  in addition to attracting new personnel 
competition for qualified technical and other personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area and israel  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we generally do not have employment contracts or noncompetition agreements with any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and other technical personnel  could negatively affect our business 
we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
the spin off of c cube s semiconductor business gave rise to a significant tax liability of approximately million based on a valuation of the semiconductor business of billion 
the estimated liability was paid on august  c cube determined the valuation by using the volume weighted average price on may   the first trading day following the spin off  which resulted in a share price of 
under state law  harmonic generally is liable for all of c cube s debts  including c cube s liability for taxes resulting from the spin off 
c cube retained and transferred to harmonic in the merger an amount of cash and other consideration sufficient to pay this liability as well as all other tax liabilities of c cube and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the merger 
the merger agreement stipulates that harmonic will be indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business if the cash reserves are not sufficient to satisfy all of c cube s tax liabilities for periods prior to the merger 
if for any reason  the spun off semiconductor business does not have sufficient cash to pay such taxes  or if there are additional taxes due with respect to the non semiconductor business and harmonic cannot be indemnified by c cube  harmonic generally will remain liable  and such liability could have a material adverse effect on harmonic 
the spun off semiconductor business recently agreed to be acquired by lsi logic  which will assume these obligations to harmonic 
due to the structure of the merger transaction  harmonic is liable for c cube s general pre merger liabilities and any liabilities relating to c cube s semiconductor business for which the spun off semiconductor business is unable to indemnify harmonic 
the merger of c cube into harmonic  with harmonic as the surviving entity  resulted in our assuming all of the liabilities of c cube at the time of the merger 
pursuant to the merger agreement  harmonic is indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business for liabilities associated with c cube s historic semiconductor business 
however  if the spun off semiconductor business or lsi logic  assuming the acquisition is completed is unable to fulfill its indemnification obligations to harmonic or if general liability claims not specifically associated with c cube s historic semiconductor business are asserted  we would have to assume such obligations 
those obligations could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be subject to risks associated with other acquisitions 
we have made and may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make acquisitions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel and operations or integrating the acquired technology or products into ours 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
difficulties in the development and production of video encoding chips by c cube s spun off semiconductor business may adversely impact us 
the divicom business and c cube semiconductor business collaborated on the production and development of two video encoding microelectronic chips prior to the merger 
in connection with the merger  harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business entered into a contractual relationship under which harmonic will have access to certain of the spun off semiconductor business technologies and products which the divicom business previously depended on for its product and service offerings 
however  under the contractual relationships between harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business  the semiconductor business does not have a firm commitment to continue the development of video encoding microelectronic chips 
as a result  the semiconductor business may choose not to continue future development of the chips for any reason 
the semiconductor business may also encounter in the future technological difficulties in the production and development of the chips 
if the spun off semiconductor business is not able to or does not sustain its development and production efforts in this area  we may not be able to fully recognize the benefits of the acquisition 
see supply  license and development agreement at page of the joint proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on march   for further details of harmonic s business relationship with the spun off semiconductor business after the merger 
if sales forecasted for a particular period are not realized in that period due to the unpredictable sales cycles of our products  our operating results for that period will be harmed 
the sales cycles of many of our products  particularly our newer products and products sold internationally  are typically unpredictable and usually involve a significant technical evaluation  a commitment of capital and other resources by cable  satellite  and other network operators  delays associated with cable  satellite  and other network operators internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  time required to engineer the deployment of new technologies or services within broadband networks  and testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  our sales cycles generally last three to six months  but can last up to months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be substantially lower than anticipated 
as a result of the merger  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from systems contracts 
a substantial portion of divicom s revenues are from systems contracts which include a combination of product sales as well as installation and integration services 
revenue forecasts are based on estimated timing of the systems installation and integration 
because the systems contracts generally span several quarters  the timing of revenue is difficult to predict and could result in lower than expected revenue in any particular quarter 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
we currently hold issued united states patents and issued foreign patents  and have a number of patent applications pending 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken in the past  and may take in the future  legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business and operating results 
in order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
although many companies are often willing to enter into such technology development or licensing agreements  we cannot assure you that such agreements will be negotiated on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  when necessary  could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could cause our business to suffer 
harmonic s industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the telecommunications industry have extensive patent portfolios 
from time to time  third parties  including these leading companies  have asserted and may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us or our customers 
indeed  a number of third parties  including leading companies  have asserted patent rights to technologies that are important to us 
we expect to increasingly be subject to infringement claims asserted by third parties as the numbers of products and competitors in the telecommunications industry grow 
in this regard  since december   we have been in communication with several of harmonic s customers who have been contacted by one of these leading companies that believes certain of our products require a license under a number of their patents 
we currently are reviewing the identified patents to examine whether we consider a license necessary 
while it is our understanding that the third party is willing to grant our customers a non exclusive license under the identified patents  there is no assurance that the terms of any offered license would be acceptable to them or that failure to obtain a license would not cause our operating results to be materially adversely affected 
we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources  and we are increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers 
many components  subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers  particularly foreign suppliers  and our increasing reliance on subcontractors involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  subassemblies or modules and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components  subassemblies or modules 
in particular  certain optical components have been recently in short supply and are available only from a small number of suppliers  including sole source suppliers 
while we expend considerable efforts to qualify additional optical component sources  consolidation of suppliers in the industry including the acquisitions of etek dynamics and sdl inc by jds uniphase and the small number of viable alternatives have limited the results of these efforts 
certain key elements of our digital headend products are provided by a sole foreign supplier 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or subcontractors 
an inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business 
we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of these components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we may be subject to an increasing risk of inventory obsolescence in the future  which could harm our business 
we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
while we expect to continue to report losses  excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  for at least the first two quarters of  and currently expect total capital expenditures of million in  we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including bank line of credit facility  will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
in addition  we may review other potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings or enhance our technical capabilities 
while we have no other current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any potential acquisition  any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital 
funds may not be available at the time or times needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california s current electrical and natural gas crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
we rely on a continuous power supply for manufacturing and to conduct our business operations 
recent interruptions in electrical power supplies in california are anticipated to become more frequent  particularly during the coming summer 
in addition  the cost of electricity and natural gas is expected to rise significantly 
power outages could disrupt our manufacturing and business operations and those of many of our suppliers  and could cause us to fail to meet production schedules and commitments to customers and other third parties 
any disruption to our operations or those of our suppliers could result in damage to our current and prospective business relationships and could result in lost revenue and additional expenses  thereby harming our business and our results of operations 
we face risks associated with having important facilities and resources located in israel 
harmonic maintains two facilities in the state of israel with a total of approximately employees 
the personnel at these facilities represent a significant portion of our research and development operations 
accordingly  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel  and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could significantly harm our business 
we cannot assure you that the protraction or escalation of current tensions in the middle east will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  most of our employees in israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on harmonic in the future 
securities class action claims 
between june and august   several actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws by the company and certain of its officers and directors were filed in or removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the court entered orders relating and consolidating all of the securities class actions and permitting plaintiffs to file a consolidated amended complaint 
on november   plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint 
on december   plaintiffs filed a corrected consolidated amended complaint the complaint 
the complaint is brought on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased the company s publicly traded securities between january and june  the complaint also alleges claims on behalf of a purported subclass of persons who purchased c cube securities between january and may  in addition to the company and certain of its officers and directors  the complaint also names c cube microsystems inc and several of its officers and directors as defendants 
the complaint alleges that  by making false or misleading statements regarding the company s prospects and customers and its acquisition of c cube  the defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the complaint also alleges that the defendants violated section a of the exchange act and sections  a  and of the securities act of by filing a false or misleading registration statement  prospectus  and joint proxy in connection with the c cube acquisition 
on february   the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint 
a hearing is scheduled for may  a derivative action purporting to be on behalf of the company was filed against its directors in the superior court for the county of santa clara on september  the company also was named as a nominal defendant 
the complaint is based on allegations similar to those found in the securities class actions and claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by  among other things  causing the company to violate federal securities laws 
the derivative action was removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california on september  the court has approved a stipulation by the parties to stay the derivative action pending a decision on the motions to dismiss the securities class actions 
the parties have agreed to meet and confer regarding further scheduling in the derivative action if no ruling on the motions to dismiss has been made by april  based on its review of the complaints in the securities class action  the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the securities class action and intends to defend itself vigorously 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  particularly in recent years  and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above their purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company has a number of international subsidiaries each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
in addition  the company has various international branch offices which provide sales support and systems integration services 
while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results  fair values or cash flows  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of less than two years 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if the company were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity
