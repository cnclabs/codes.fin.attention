the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks relating to our business in this section 
overview we were founded in and opened our first store in carlsbad  california 
by september  we had developed into a regional retailer with stores in three states 
on september   two funds managed by saunders karp megrue partners  llc  a private equity investment firm  acquired the business from its founders with the intention of pursuing an accelerated national new store expansion program 
bernard zeichner  who had joined us as president in may  shared the belief that a significant opportunity existed to leverage the strength of our new store economics by further penetrating existing markets and expanding the chain into other regions of the country 
we subsequently implemented a series of strategic initiatives to position us to support an accelerated store rollout 
we hired a number of senior executives with national retail experience to complement our existing senior management team and significantly upgraded our management information systems  distribution systems and facilities 
in september  we launched our second distinct retail concept by acquiring stores in five states from rampage retailing  inc our strong operating performance over the past three fiscal years reflects the benefits of the infrastructure building process that we undertook  the successful integration of the rampage chain and the successful execution of our national expansion program for the charlotte russe and rampage chains 
we have leveraged this success to begin developing an additional retail concept known as charlotte s room  which features accessories  novelty gifts and other home d cor items for to year olds

table of contents quarterly results and seasonality we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by strong sales during the back to school  easter and winter holiday seasons 
the strength of each of these three seasons generally provides relatively balanced sales during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the second quarter of each fiscal year 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays  as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled risks relating to our business 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended september  this data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september  includes an additional week of operations compared to the weeks of operations for each of the other fiscal quarters presented below 
we believe that this information has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements result primarily from capital expenditures related to new store openings 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations  although we have also used borrowings under prior credit facilities in the past for acquisitions  including our acquisition and the acquisition of the rampage stores 
due to the rapid turnover of our inventory  we generate trade payables and other accrued liabilities sufficient to offset our working capital requirements  and this allows us to generally operate with negative working capital 
as of september   we had working capital of approximately million which included million of cash and cash equivalents 
during fiscal years  and  our net cash provided by operations was million  million and million 
in fiscal  our net cash provided by operations increased as a result of increased operating earnings and increased current liabilities 
our cash used in investing activities related to new store openings and other corporate outlays were million  million and million in fiscal  and during fiscal  we repaid million of our subordinated debt owed to two funds managed by saunders karp megrue partners  llc  although net borrowings under our revolving credit facility rose only million during the same period 
in fiscal  we repaid the remaining million balance under the revolving credit facility using the million net proceeds of our initial public offering and cash flows from operations 
based on our experience with store openings for our two established concepts  we estimate that the average net investment to open these new stores is approximately  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions  and initial inventory  net of payables 
during the first year of operations  our stores opened during the four year period ended september  generated store level operating cash flow in excess of  representing an average cash return on investment of approximately 
there can be no assurance that our new stores will obtain these levels in the future  especially given the weak retailing trends during the second half of fiscal year we opened our eight charlotte s room stores during fiscal years and accordingly  we are unable to reasonably estimate the overall cash return on investment for charlotte s room as a mature concept 
after taking into account new store construction  existing store remodeling  distribution center expansion  and other corporate capital projects  total capital expenditures for fiscal are projected to be approximately million 
our unsecured revolving credit facility with fleet national bank  as agent  provides us with a million revolving line of credit under which borrowed funds bear interest at either the eurodollar rate plus or the base rate of fleet national bank  at our option  subject to certain adjustments 
at september   no outstanding balance existed under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios such as total liabilities to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  fixed charges coverage  and minimum net worth 
we believe that cash flows from operations  our current cash balance and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated capital expenditure requirements for fiscal if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion program or decide to expand our charlotte s room concept beyond our current plans  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 

table of contents inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of september   we had no borrowings against our credit facility 
however  we may borrow additional funds under our revolving credit facility as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
forward looking statements we have made statements under the captions  business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risks relating to our business  as well as in other sections of this form k  that are forward looking statements 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  intend  anticipate  believe  estimate and continue or similar words 
these forward looking statements may also use different phrases 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
these forward looking statements  which are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions about us  may include  among other things  projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition  our anticipated growth strategies  and general and regional economic conditions  industry trends  consumer demands and preferences  competition from other retailers and uncertainties generally associated with women s apparel and accessory retailing 
there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or which we do not fully control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  including shopping mall traffic and shopping patterns  timing of openings for new shopping malls or our stores  fashion trends  national or regional economic influences  and weather 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this form k might not occur 

table of contents risks relating to our business 
we intend to continue to open new stores at a rapid rate  which could strain our resources and cause us to operate our business less effectively 
our growth will largely depend on successfully opening and operating new stores 
during fiscal  we opened new stores  of which were charlotte russe and rampage stores  and we closed two charlotte russe stores 
the net addition of stores represented an increase of approximately from the number of stores open at the end of fiscal we plan to open at least new charlotte russe and rampage stores during fiscal  an increase of from the end of the prior fiscal year for these chains 
we intend to continue to increase our number of charlotte russe and rampage stores by approximately per year for at least the next few years 
during fiscal  we opened five charlotte s room stores 
we also plan to expand our test of the charlotte s room concept to a total of stores during fiscal our planned expansion will require that we substantially increase our distribution center capacity during fiscal and continually monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems 
this rapid expansion also will place increased demands on our managerial  operational and administrative resources 
these demands and needs will be even greater and require more complex solutions to the extent we expand the charlotte s room concept beyond our current plans 
these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our individual stores and slow our new store growth 
our planned expansion involves a number of risks that could prevent or delay the successful opening of new stores as well as impact the performance of our existing stores 
our ability to open and operate new stores successfully depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify suitable store locations  the availability of which is outside of our control  negotiate acceptable lease terms  including desired tenant improvement allowances  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores  hire  train and retain store personnel  successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations  particularly our new charlotte s room locations  and satisfy the fashion preferences of new geographic areas 
in addition  many of our new stores will be opened in regions of the united states in which we currently have few or no stores 
the expansion into new markets may present competitive  merchandising and distribution challenges that are different from those currently encountered in our existing markets 
further  our charlotte s room concept may not gain market acceptance 
any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent our new store openings are in existing markets  we may experience reduced net sales volumes in existing stores in those markets 
the decline in general economic conditions has led to reduced consumer demand for our apparel and accessories 
consumer spending habits  including spending for the fashionable apparel and related accessories that we sell  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
the general slowdown in the united states economy and the uncertain economic outlook has adversely affected consumer spending habits and mall traffic  which may cause us to delay or slow our expansion plans and result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 

table of contents our stores are heavily dependent on the customer traffic generated by shopping malls 
most of our store locations are not sufficiently concentrated to make significant marketing expenditures cost effective 
as a result  we depend heavily on locating our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls in order to generate customer traffic 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls or the success of individual shopping malls 
if at any time our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations decline or do not meet the expectations of research analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our quarterly results of operations for our individual stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for instance  our quarterly comparable store sales increases have ranged as high as and as low as a negative over the past eight quarters 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  fashion trends  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  the effectiveness of our test and reorder strategy in maintaining appropriate inventory levels  changes in our merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  actions by competitors or mall anchor tenants  weather conditions  and the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores 
our business and reputation may be adversely affected if our rampage stores are associated with negative publicity related to the use of the rampage trademark by other parties 
in connection with the acquisition of our rampage stores  we acquired the exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark on exterior and interior signage identifying our rampage stores  as well as the non exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark for promotional and advertising materials 
we do not  however  have the right to use the rampage trademark on our merchandise 
the right to market merchandise under the rampage trademark was retained by rampage clothing company 
further  nothing in our license agreement with rampage clothing company prohibits the sale of merchandise bearing the rampage trademark by other parties or the licensing of the rampage trademark to other parties 
in fact  rampage clothing company has licensed the trademark to other parties 
we believe a positive rampage brand image is important to our success 
accordingly  if the merchandise sold by the rampage clothing company or other parties under the rampage trademark is of low quality or if the rampage clothing company or these parties otherwise engage in activities that negatively affect the rampage trademark or are otherwise inconsistent with our rampage store concept  consumers could lose confidence in our merchandise and our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to consumer fashion tastes 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success is heavily dependent both on the priority our target customers place on fashion and on our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
current fashion tastes place significant emphasis on a fashionable look 
in the past this emphasis has increased and decreased through fashion cycles and decreased emphasis has adversely affected our results 
although we rely on a test and reorder merchandise strategy to minimize our exposure to misjudging fashion tastes and to reduce inventory risks  we can not assure you that this strategy will continue to be successful 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles  trends  desired images or brand preferences could lead to  among other things  excess inventories and higher markdowns  as well as decreased appeal of our brands 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of retailers  including national and local specialty retail stores  regional retail chains  traditional department stores and  to a lesser extent  mall merchandisers 
our market share and results of operations may be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors 
also  many of our competitors also are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
we rely on our good relationships with vendors to implement our business strategy successfully 
our business is dependent on continued good relations with our vendors 
in particular  we believe that we generally are able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors because we are perceived as a desirable customer 
our test and reorder merchandise strategy also relies in large part on our ability to obtain merchandise from our vendors within three to six weeks from the date of order 
our failure to maintain good relations with our vendors could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may in turn lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
our operations  as well as a substantial number of our stores  are concentrated in the southwest  which makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region 
our headquarters and distribution center are located in california  and a substantial number of our stores are located in california and the southwest 
as a result  our business is more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors 
these factors include  among others  economic and weather conditions  demographic and population changes and fashion tastes 
further  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event  such as an earthquake  affecting southern california could significantly disrupt our operations 
the state of california is currently experiencing an energy crisis 
although we have not experienced material increases in either our cost of goods sold or overall operating expenses as a result of this crisis  if the crisis continues or becomes more severe  our energy costs may increase significantly in the future for our california based operations 
any such increase could be material and could adversely affect our margins and our profitability 
our failure to retain our existing senior management team could adversely affect our business 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores 
this execution requires experienced and talented management 
we currently have a management team with a great deal of experience with us and in apparel retailing 
if we were to lose the benefit of this experience  and in particular if we were to lose the services of bernard zeichner  our chief executive officer  or harriet bailiss sustarsic  our president and chief merchandising officer  our business could be adversely affected 
we do not maintain key man insurance on any of the members of our management team 

table of contents we rely on third parties for upgrading and maintaining our management information systems 
if these third parties do not adequately perform these functions appropriately  our business could be disrupted 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our information systems 
in particular  we rely heavily on the automated sortation system used in our distribution center and the merchandise management system used to track sales and inventory 
we also rely on a lawson software package for our accounting  financial reporting and human resource functions 
we depend on our vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade these systems for the continued ability of these systems to support our business as we expand 
the software programs supporting our automated sorting equipment and processing our inventory management information were licensed to us by independent software developers 
the inability of these developers to continue to maintain and upgrade these software programs would disrupt our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner
