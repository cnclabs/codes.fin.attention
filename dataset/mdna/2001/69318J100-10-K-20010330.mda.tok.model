item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about the industry in which the company operates  management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management 
all statements  trends  analyses and other information contained in this report relative to trends in net sales  gross margin and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements  including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate and intend and other similar expressions  constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or expressed in such statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  those set forth under the caption factors that may affect future results and financial condition included within this section 
particular attention should be paid to the cautionary statements involving the industry s rapid technological change and exposure to inventory obsolescence  availability and allocations of goods  reliance on vendor support and relationships  competitive risks  pricing risks  and economic risks 
except as required by law  the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
readers  however  should carefully review the factors set forth in other reports or documents that the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
general the company was founded in as a mail order business offering a broad range of software and accessories for ibm and ibm compatible personal computers 
the founders goal was to provide consumers with superior service and high quality branded products at competitive prices 
the company initially sought customers through advertising in selected computer industry publications and the use of inbound toll free telemarketing 
currently  the company seeks to generate sales through i outbound telemarketing by account managers focused on the business  education and government markets  ii inbound calls from customers responding to the company s catalogs and other advertising and iii the company s internet web site 
the company offers both pc compatible products and mac compatible products 
reliance on mac product sales has decreased over the last four years  from of net sales in to of net sales for the year ended december  the company believes that sales attributable to mac products will continue to decrease as a percentage of net sales and may also decline in absolute dollar volume in and future years 
all of the company s product categories experienced strong growth for the year ended december   with sales of networking communications representing the fastest growing category 
sales of networking communications  which generally yield a high gross profit margin percentage  relative to other products  grew by more than in when compared to partially as a result of the higher networking communication sales  the company s gross margin percentage improved for the year ended december  sales of computer systems result in a relatively high dollar sales order  as reflected in the increase in the company s average order size from in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  computer systems generally provide the largest gross profit dollar contribution per order of all the company s products  although they usually yield the lowest gross margin percentage 
the company s profit margins are also influenced by  among other things  industry pricing and the relative mix of inbound versus outbound sales 
generally  pricing in the computer and related products market is very aggressive  and the company intends to maintain prices at competitive levels 
since outbound sales are typically to corporate accounts that purchase at volume discounts  the gross margin on such sales is generally lower than inbound sales 
however  the gross profit dollar contribution per order is generally higher as average order sizes of orders to corporate accounts are usually larger 
the company believes that outbound sales will continue to represent a larger portion of its business mix in future periods 
the direct marketing of personal computers and related products is highly competitive 
in addition to other direct marketers and manufacturers who sell direct  such as dell and gateway  manufacturers of pcs sold by the company  such as apple  compaq and ibm  have also announced or implemented varying plans to sell pcs directly to end users 
the company currently believes that direct sales by compaq and ibm will not have a significant adverse effect upon the company s net sales 
most product manufacturers provide the company with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in the company s catalogs 
although the level of co op advertising support available to the company from certain manufacturers has declined  and may decline further in the future  the overall level of co op advertising revenues has continued to increase consistent with the company s increased levels of spending for catalog and other advertising programs 
the company believes that the overall levels of co op advertising revenues available over the next twelve months will be consistent with the company s planned advertising programs 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from the company s statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales in millions   net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses additional stockholder officer compensation income from operations interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income pro forma net income the following table sets forth the company s percentage of net sales by platform  sales channel  and product mix years ended december  platform pc and multi platform mac total sales channel corporate outbound inbound telesales on line internet total product mix notebooks desktop servers storage devices software networking communications printers video monitors memory accessories other total sales of enterprise server and networking products included in the above product mix were  and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased million  or  to  million in from  million in the growth in net sales was attributable to i a continued expansion and increased productivity of our outbound telemarketing group  and ii an increased focus on enterprise server and networking product categories 
as of december   the number of account managers totaled  a increase  compared to account managers at the end of as a result  outbound sales increased million  or  to  million in from million in enterprise networking product sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in gross profit dollars was attributable to the increase in net sales described above 
gross profit margin increased from in to in due to a continuing focus on solution sales to business  government and educational customers and an increased focus on higher margin enterprise networking products cited above 
the company s gross margin may vary based upon vendor support programs  product mix  pricing strategies  market conditions and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of sales to in from in this increase was attributable to increases in sales personnel  bad debt  and facility costs  and offset by a decrease in net advertising expense 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in for the reasons discussed above 
interest expense increased by 
million  or  to million in from million in due to increased borrowings under the company s line of credit necessitated by the company s growth 
interest expense is offset by interest income from short term investments 
the company s effective tax rate was for both and net income increased by million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the increase in income from operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased million  or  to  million in from million in the growth in net sales  which included a increase in average order size  was attributable to i continued improvements in merchandising and product mix  including the stocking and sale of computer systems  ii continued expansion and increased productivity of the company s outbound telemarketing group  iii an increase in the number of catalog mailings  and iv sales attributed to the acquisition of comteq in june notebook computer systems increased to of net sales in from in outbound sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the number of catalogs mailed increased by  from million catalogs in to million catalogs in gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in gross profit dollars was attributable to the increase in net sales described above 
gross profit margin decreased from in to in due to a higher rate of growth in sales of lower margin computer systems  increased price competition  decreases in average unit selling prices and an increase in the rate of outbound sales which generally carry a lower gross margin percentage 
however  the company continued to generate higher gross profit dollars per order  enabling it to leverage its operating expenses  as described below 
the company s gross profit margin may vary based upon vendor support programs  product mix  pricing strategies  market conditions and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in the increase in expense was attributable to increases in volume sensitive costs such as sales personnel and credit card fees 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was attributable to the continued leveraging of selling  general and administrative expenses over a larger sales base 
additional stockholder officer compensation paid to the company s two principal stockholders in  who also serve as officers and directors  represented amounts accrued or distributed in excess of aggregate annual base salaries  aggregate base salaries for approved by the board of directors of the company and generally represent company related federal income tax obligations payable by the stockholders 
there were no such charges in as the company was a c corporation for the entire year 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in for the reasons discussed above 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in from 
million in due to the capital lease obligation for the merrimack facility which began in december and increased borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the tax provision for reflects a full year of the company being taxed as a c corporation 
in  the company s effective tax rate was as a result of both its taxation as an s corporation for a part of the year as well as the recognition of certain deferred tax assets upon conversion to a c corporation 
net income increased by million  or  to million in from million in due to the result of the increase in income from operations 
as described above  net income was also favorably impacted by the company s previous s corporation status and its conversion to a c corporation 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under its bank line of credit  will be sufficient to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least for the next twelve calendar months 
the company s ability to continue funding its planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
net cash used by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million and million provided in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the primary factors historically affecting cash flows from operations are the company s net income and changes in the levels of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
historically  inventories and accounts payable have increased as a result of the sales growth of the company 
accounts payable decreased in due to increased utilization of vendor discounts 
accounts receivable have increased primarily due to an increase in open account sales to commercial customers resulting from the company s continued efforts to increase its sales to such customers offset in part by a higher rate of increase in accounts receivable allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts related to the growth in sales 
at december   the company had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence and will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under security agreements to facilitate the purchase of inventory 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of computer hardware and software and other fixed assets  to be approximately million for the year ending december  the company has an unsecured credit agreement with a bank providing for short term borrowings up to million  which bears interest at various rates ranging from the prime rate at december  to prime less  depending on the ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
the credit agreement includes various customary financial and operating covenants  including restrictions on the payment of dividends  none of which the company believes significantly restricts its operations 
no borrowings were outstanding at december  in january  the company used available cash to acquire the merisel americas  inc call center in marlborough  massachusetts 
in  it used available cash and sellers notes to acquire comteq federal  inc  a maryland based specialty reseller of computing products to agencies of the federal government 
management could  in the future  use debt  cash  or stock to effect additional acquisitions 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas adjusted to be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
the company adopted sfas effective january  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company because the company does not have significant derivative activity 
in december the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab clarifies certain elements of revenue recognition 
since december  the sec has issued several amendments that postponed the implementation date to the fourth quarter of fiscal implementation of the sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
the consensus specifically stated that all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling  if any  represent revenues earned for the goods provided and should be classified as revenue 
it was previously the company s policy to record such revenues as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the company adopted this consensus in the fourth quarter of fiscal all net sales amounts and gross margin percentages reflect the reclassification of amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling as revenue for all periods presented 
inflation the company has historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
the company does not expect inflation to have a significant impact on its business in the future 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future results and financial condition are dependent on its ability to continue to successfully market  sell and distribute computers  hardware and software 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable financial condition and operating results 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future financial condition and operating results include  without limitation  the following factors the company has experienced rapid growth in recent years and there is no assurance that it will be able to manage or sustain such growth 
the company s net sales have grown from million for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  this growth has placed  and any future growth will place  increasing demands on the company s administrative  operational  financial and other resources 
the company s staffing levels and operating expenses have increased and are expected to increase substantially in the future 
the company also expects that any future growth will continue to challenge its ability to hire  train  motivate and manage employees 
if the company s net sales do not increase in proportion to its operating expenses or if the company experiences a decrease in net sales  or its information systems do not expand to meet increasing demands  or the company fails to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel or otherwise fails to manage its growth effectively  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company may experience quarterly fluctuations and seasonality which could impact its business 
several factors have caused the company s sales and results of operations to fluctuate  and the company expects these fluctuations to continue on a quarterly basis 
causes of these fluctuations include 
changes in the overall level of economic activity  
changes in the level of business investment in information technology products  
the condition of the personal computer industry in general  
shifts in demand for hardware and software products  
industry shipments of new products or upgrades  
the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  
fluctuations in marketing response rates  
fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping and printing costs and in merchandise returns  
adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution or shipping  
shifts in the timing of holidays  and 
changes in the company s product offerings 
the company bases its operating expenditures on sales forecasts 
if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  the company s operating results could suffer 
in addition  customer response rates to the company s catalog mailings are subject to variations 
the first and last quarters of the year generally have higher response rates while the two middle quarters typically have lower response rates 
the company is exposed to inventory obsolescence due to the rapid technological changes occurring in the personal computer industry 
the market for personal computer products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of customers in that marketplace 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts  the company has and may continue to carry increased inventory levels of certain products 
by so doing  it is subject to the increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
also  in order to implement its business strategy  the company intends  among other things  to place larger than typical inventory stocking orders  and increase participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
in the future  the company may also participate in end of life cycle purchase opportunities and market products on a private label basis  which would increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in addition  the company sometimes acquires special purchase products without return privileges 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory 
in addition  manufacturers are limiting return rights and are also taking steps to reduce their inventory exposure by supporting build to order programs authorizing distributors and resellers to assemble computer hardware under the manufacturers brands 
these trends reduce the costs to manufacturers and shift the burden of inventory risk to resellers like the company which could negatively impact the company s financial condition 
the company acquires products for resale from a limited number of vendors  the loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company acquires products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors and other sources 
the five vendors supplying the greatest amount of goods to the company constituted and of the company s total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
among these five vendors  purchases from ingram micro  inc represented and of the company s total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
purchases from tech data corporation comprised and of the company s total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
no other vendor supplied more than of the company s total product purchases in the year ended december  if the company were unable to acquire products from ingram micro  inc  the company could experience a short term disruption in the availability of products and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
substantially all of the company s contracts and arrangements with its vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or the company without notice or upon short notice 
most of the company s product vendors provide it with trade credit  of which the net amount outstanding at december  was million 
termination  interruption or contraction of relationships with the company s vendors  including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
some product manufacturers either do not permit the company to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to direct marketers such as the company 
an element of the company s business strategy is to increase its participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
the availability of certain desired products  especially in the direct marketing channel  has been constrained in the past 
the company could experience a material adverse effect to its business if the company is unable to source first to market purchase or similar opportunities  or if the company faces the reemergence of significant availability constraints 
the company may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to it by vendors 
some product manufacturers and distributors provide the company with incentives such as supplier reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection  rebates and other similar arrangements 
the increasingly competitive computer hardware market has already resulted in the following 
reduction or elimination of some of these incentive programs  
more restrictive price protection and other terms  and 
in some cases  reduced advertising allowances and incentives 
most product manufacturers provide the company with co op advertising support and in exchange the company covers their products in the company s catalogs 
this support significantly defrays the company s catalog production expense 
in the past  the company has experienced a decrease in the level of co op advertising support available to it from certain manufacturers 
the level of co op advertising support the company receives from some manufacturers may further decline in the future 
such a decline could increase the company s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flows 
the company faces many competitive risks 
the direct marketing industry and the computer products retail business  in particular  are highly competitive 
the company competes with consumer electronics and computer retail stores  including superstores 
the company also competes with other direct marketers of hardware and software and computer related products  including an increasing number of internet retailers  some of which sell products at or below cost 
certain hardware and software vendors are selling their products directly through their own catalogs and over the internet 
the company competes not only for customers  but also for co op advertising support from personal computer product manufacturers 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial and marketing resources  larger catalog circulations and customer bases  and other resources than does the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors offer a wider range of products and services than it does and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company 
the company expects competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry 
the company cannot assure that it can continue to compete effectively against its current or future competitors 
in addition  price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer hardware and software market and the company cannot assure that the company will not face increased price competition 
if the company encounters new competition or fails to compete effectively against competitors  its business could be adversely affected 
in addition  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
the company faces and will continue to face significant and intense price competition 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the personal computer industry and the company expects pricing pressures to continue 
an increase in price competition could result in a reduction of the company s profit margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions or otherwise 
also  the company s recent increase in sales of personal computer hardware products are generally producing lower profit margins than those associated with software products 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of the company s market share  reduced sales and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the methods of distributing computers and related products are changing and such changes may negatively impact the company and its business 
the manner in which computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as on line shopping services  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
some of the company s vendors  including apple  compaq and ibm  currently sell some of their products directly to end users and have stated their intentions to increase the level of such direct sales 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company could experience system failures which would interfere with its ability to process orders 
the company depends on the accuracy and proper use of its management information systems including its telephone system 
many of the company s key functions depend on the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by its management information systems  including 
the company s ability to manage inventory and accounts receivable collection  
the company s ability to purchase  sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  and 
the company s ability to maintain operations 
interruptions could result from natural disasters as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
the company s management information systems require continual upgrades to most effectively manage its operations and customer database 
although the company maintains some redundant systems  with full data backup  a substantial interruption in management information systems or in telephone communication systems would substantially hinder its ability to process customer orders and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company may not have sufficient distribution facilities to support future growth 
the company s current distribution facilities may be inadequate to support any significant growth in the future 
the company currently occupies two buildings aggregating  square feet in wilmington  ohio under leases which expire in and there is no assurance that the company can renew these leases on favorable terms or at all 
the company is continually assessing its needs for additional distribution facilities 
there can be no assurance that suitable commercial facilities will be available  or if available  that such facilities would be available at commercially reasonable rates 
the company relies on the continued development of electronic commerce and internet infrastructure development 
the company s level of sales made over the internet has increased in part because of the growing use and acceptance of the internet by end users 
this growth is a recent development 
no one can be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt and continue to use the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
sales of computer products over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall computer product sales 
growth of the company s internet sales is dependent on potential customers using the internet in addition to traditional means of commerce to purchase products 
the company cannot accurately predict the rate at which they will do so 
the company s success in growing its internet business will depend in large part upon the development of an infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
if the number of internet users or their use of internet resources continues to grow rapidly  such growth may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
the company s ability to increase the speed with which it provides services to customers and to increase the scope of such services ultimately is limited by and reliant upon the speed and reliability of the networks operated by third parties 
the company cannot assure that networks and infrastructure providing sufficient capacity and reliability will continue to be developed 
the company depends heavily on third party shippers to deliver its products to customers 
the company ships approximately of its products to customers by airborne freight corporation d b a airborne express  with the remainder being shipped by united parcel service of america  inc and other overnight delivery and surface services 
a strike or other interruption in service by these shippers could adversely affect the company s ability to market or deliver products to customers on a timely basis 
the company may experience potential increases in shipping  paper and postage costs  which may adversely effect its business if the company were not able to pass such increases on to its customers 
shipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of the company s business 
increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could significantly impact the cost of producing and mailing the company s catalogs and shipping customer orders 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically and the company has no control over future increases 
the company has a long term contract with airborne express whereby it ships products to the company s customers 
the company believes that it has negotiated favorable shipping rates with airborne 
the company generally invoices customers for shipping and handling charges 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass on to its customers the full cost  including any future increases in the cost  of commercial delivery services such as airborne express 
the company also incurs substantial paper and postage costs related to its marketing activities  including producing and mailing its catalogs 
paper prices historically have been cyclical and the company has experienced substantial increases in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if the company cannot pass on such increases to its customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance may materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company mails catalogs and sends electronic messages to names in its proprietary customer database and to potential customers whose names the company obtains from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
worldwide public concern regarding personal privacy has subjected the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information to increased scrutiny 
any domestic or foreign legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting these practices could negatively affect the company s business 
the company faces many uncertainties relating to the collection of state sales or use tax 
the company presently collects sales tax only on taxable sales of products to residents of ohio  tennessee  maryland  massachusetts and virginia 
the company began collecting sales tax in massachusetts in january taxable sales to customers located within ohio  tennessee  maryland  massachusetts and virginia were approximately of the company s net sales during the year ended december  various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents 
in  the united states supreme court affirmed its position that it is unconstitutional for a state to impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are limited to the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier 
however  legislation that would expand the ability of states to impose sales tax collection obligations on direct marketers has been introduced in congress on many occasions 
due to its presence on various forms of electronic media and other factors  the company s contact with many states may exceed the contact involved in the supreme court case 
the company cannot predict the level of contact that is sufficient to permit a state to impose on us a sales tax collection obligation 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on the company in states to which the company ships products would result in additional administrative expenses to the company  could result in price increases to its customers  and could reduce demand for its product 
the company is dependent on key personnel 
the company s future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of its senior executives 
the competition for qualified management personnel in the computer products industry is very intense  and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s success and plans for future growth will also depend on its ability to hire  train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of its business  including sales account managers and technical support personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve the company s business objectives 
the company is controlled by two principal stockholders 
patricia gallup and david hall  the company s two principal stockholders  beneficially own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
because of their beneficial stock ownership  these stockholders can continue to elect the members of the board of directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting 
similarly  such stockholders can control decisions to adopt  amend or repeal the company s charter and bylaws  or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of the company s stockholders and prevent a takeover of the company by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party  which could deprive the company s stockholders of a control premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of the company 
such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of the company s public stockholders 
in connection with the company s initial public offering  the principal stockholders placed all except  of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by them into a voting trust  pursuant to which they are required to agree as to the manner of voting such shares in order for the shares to be voted 
such provisions could discourage bids for the company s common stock at a premium as well as have a negative impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  the company s unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
the company had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december  the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material 
the company s credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
the fair value of the company s credit agreement is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates  as the change in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates is not material
