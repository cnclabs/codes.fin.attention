in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated the expected future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compared such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount was recoverable 
for those oil and gas properties which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment was determined to exist  thus  the company adjusted the carrying amount of the respective oil and gas properties to their fair value as determined by discounting their estimated future cash flows 
the factors used to determine fair value included  but were not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with a risk adjusted rate of return

penn virginia s comparative reserve replacement measures are as follows finding and development cost a current year three year weighted average reserve replacement cost b current year three year weighted average reserve replacement percentage c current year three year weighted average finding and development cost  reserve replacement cost and reserve replacement percentage are not measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are not intended to be used in lieu of gaap presentation 
these measures are commonly used by financial statement users as a measurement to determine the performance of a company s oil and gas activities 
a finding and development cost is calculated by dividing costs incurred in certain oil and gas activities less proved property acquisitions  by reserve extensions  discoveries and other additions and revisions 
b reserve replacement cost is calculated by dividing costs incurred in certain oil and gas activities  including acquisitions  by reserve purchases  extensions  discoveries and other additions and revisions 
c reserve replacement percentage is calculated by dividing reserve purchases  revisions  extensions  discoveries and other additions  by oil and gas production 
mineable and merchantable coal reserves penn virginia s mineable and merchantable coal reserves were million tons at december   compared with million tons in the company collected royalties for million tons in mineable and merchantable coal reserves means coal that is economically mineable using existing equipment and methods under federal and state laws now in effect

the carrying value of penn virginia s debt approximates fair value 
at december   the company had million of long term debt represented by an unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver 
the revolver matures in june and is governed by a borrowing base calculation that is redetermined semi annually 
the company has the option to elect interest at i libor plus a eurodollar margin ranging from to basis points  based on the percentage of the borrowing base outstanding or ii the greater of the prime rate or federal funds rate plus basis points 
as a result  the company s interest costs will fluctuate based on short term interest rates relating to the revolver 
price risk management 
penn virginia s price risk program permits the utilization of fixed price contracts and financial instruments such as futures  forward and option contracts and swaps to mitigate the price risks associated with fluctuations in natural gas prices as they relate to the company s anticipated production 
these contracts and or financial instruments are designated as hedges and accounted for on the accrual basis with gains and losses being recognized based on the type of contract and exposure being hedged 
realized gains and losses on natural gas financial instruments designated as hedges of anticipated transactions are treated as deferred charges or credits  as applicable  on the balance sheet until recognized 
through december   net gains and losses on such financial instruments  including accrued gains or losses upon maturity or termination of the contract  are recognized in operating income concurrently with the hedged transaction 
effective january   the company accounts for its derivative activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

and sfas no 
 alters the reporting by companies that use derivative instruments 
the new rule  which went into effect january   requires companies to recognize derivatives as assets or liabilities in their balance sheets and to measure them at fair value 
penn virginia  from time to time  hedges in the form of costless collars 
the options establish a price collar around the gas 
the hedging strategy is costless because the purchase of the put options to sell gas at the floor price was offset by the sale of the call option on penn virginia gas at the ceiling price 
if the price of gas falls  penn virginia s expected revenue stream from producing properties also declines  however  the value of the put option increases 
in accounting for cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 part of the change in option value would be reported as an operating gain or loss in penn virginia s quarterly income statement the gain or loss will be reversed in future quarters as the true value of the option diminishes to zero at the expiration date 
consequently  if the price of gas and penn virginia s expected revenue stream rises  the cost to unwind the call option increases  creating an operating loss 
as a result  the company s earnings could experience increased volatility over the term of the costless collar 
natural gas pricing was extremely volatile in in april and may of  the company entered into several physical contracts that totaling  mmcf per day for the remainder of the volumes under contract accounted for percent of penn virginia s production at a price of per mcf 
the company had one contract remaining that expires in march covering percent of anticipated first quarter production at per mcf 
this physical contract is not considered to be a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 as amended  as such contracts qualify for the normal purchase and sale exception 
in january  the company hedged percent of its anticipated production for the second and third quarters of through a basis swap and a costless collar with a floor of per mcf and a ceiling of per mcf 
additionally  basis swaps covering an additional percent of anticipated production for the same periods were executed 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows from operating activities funding for the company s activities has historically been provided by operating cash flows and bank borrowings

the properties had proved reserves of bcfe at december  in addition to significant drilling potential 
the company continued to develop the property it acquired in july in mississippi by drilling gross wells net in the acquisition  which was percent natural gas  added bcfe in proved reserves and provided numerous future drilling locations 
the company drilled seven gross net exploratory wells in a texas onshore gulf coast exploration project  of which one gross net well was successful  four gross net wells were non productive and two gross net wells are under evaluation 
the company is still evaluating the unproved properties associated with the percent working interest in the project 
capital expenditures for  before lease and proved property acquisitions  are expected to be to million including to million for the oil and gas segment and to million for the coal royalty and land management segment 
in addition  penn virginia plans to invest an additional to million in seismic 
the company plans to drill approximately to gross to net wells 
management continually reviews the company s drilling expenditures and may increase  decrease or reallocate amounts based on industry conditions 
management believes its cash flow from operations  portfolio of investments and sources of debt financing are sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditure program 
in september  the company completed an acquisition which included over million tons of high quality coal reserves as well as oil and gas leases  timber assets  a short line railroad and a coal loading dock on the kanawha river in west virginia 
the million acquisition complements the company s existing coal river properties located on the inland river system in west virginia 
the company continues to diversify its coal customer base by adding additional lessees and by searching for additional coal reserve acquisition opportunities 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided used by financing activities was million in  compared with million in and million in penn virginia has a million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolver with a final maturity of june the revolver contains financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain levels of net worth  debt to capitalization and dividend limitation restrictions  among other requirements
