same store facilities includes all facilities that we owned for the entire period of both comparison periods 
development properties and expansions are removed from these groups to avoid skewing the results 
overview storage usa  inc is one of the largest owners and operators of self storage space in the united states 
we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  and are engaged in the management  acquisition  development  construction and franchising of self storage facilities 
we are structured as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust  commonly referred to as an upreit  in which substantially all of our business is conducted through the partnership 
as of december   we owned  managed and franchised facilities containing million square feet in states and the district of columbia 
internal growth during  we continued to pursue our internal growth strategy of aggressively marketing available space and renewing existing leases at higher rents per square foot  while controlling expense growth 
we also reevaluated the amounts we charge our customers and implemented a revised late fee policy  which reduced our late fees  all as noted in our annual report 
we believe that our internal growth can best be evaluated by examining the year over year results of our same store facilities  excluding the impact on revenue of our change in late fee policy 
when excluding the impact of late fees  this comparison yields revenue growth of from to  expense growth of and overall noi growth of for the year

same store revenue and noi growth excludes late fees external growth our external growth strategy continues to focus on a combination of on balance sheet and joint venture activity to facilitate the acquisition of existing facilities and the development of new properties 
on balance sheet within storage usa  we acquired five facilities in  at a cost of approximately million 
three of the facilities acquired were formerly franchised properties located in memphis  tennessee  queens  new york  and tampa  florida 
the new york property was subsequently sold to the ge acquisition venture 
the other two facilities acquired were from unrelated third parties  and are located in denver  colorado and chicago  illinois 
we anticipate limited acquisition activity within the reit in the following table summarizes the number of facilities acquired in  and  the cost  net rentable square feet and the weighted average cost of acquisitions 
number of total net rentable weighted year acquired facilities cost square feet average cost in thousands  except for number of facilities we calculate weighted average cost based on the duration of time for which the acquired facilities were owned during the year 
the weighted average cost reflects the dollar amount of acquisitions that will impact our net income during the year of acquisition 
from a development and expansion perspective  we opened new facilities and expanded an additional within the reit during the year 
investments in development and expansion projects totaled million during the year 
the following table lists the newly developed properties opened in  and and provides data relevant to their operating performance 
physical occupancy number of available at rent per development year placed in service properties square feet square foot cost in thousands in thousands six development properties are currently under construction within the reit

we transferred nine projects in various stages of development into the ge capital development venture during the first quarter of these projects had a total projected cost of million  million of which represented the company s total costs as of march  we received million in cash  and recorded an investment in the venture of million  representing a interest 
as of december   the ge development venture had invested million  of which was funded through advances and investments by the company 
six properties are open and operating and three properties remain in design and construction 
the ge acquisition venture had invested million as of december  in the acquisition of six properties  of which was funded through advances and investments by the company 
we  along with ge capital  will continuously seek opportunities to invest the remaining venture funds 
however  based upon the current real estate environment  along with our minimum return thresholds on invested capital  we are anticipating less than million of investment activity through the ventures in for more information  see note advances and investments in real estate in our notes to the consolidated financial statements

in december of  we announced a board authorized plan to repurchase up to of our common shares outstanding through open market and private purchases 
in the third quarter of  we completed the repurchase program 
a total of million common shares were repurchased  or approximately of the outstanding common shares at december   at an average price of approximately per share  representing a total cost of million 
results of operations the following table reflects selected income and expense categories  for the years ended  and  based on a percentage of total revenues  and is referred to in the discussion that follows revenues rental and other property income service income other income total income expenses property operations and maintenance taxes costs of providing services general and administrative rental and other property income consists of rental income plus other income from property specific activities rental of floor and storage space for locks and packaging material  truck rentals and ground rents for cellular telephone antenna towers and billboards 
following is a summary of rental and other property income for the years ended december   and in thousands rental income    other property specific income    total rental and other property income    rental and other property income increased million  or  in fiscal year and million  or  in fiscal year excluding the one time impact of the change in our late fee policy  rental and other property income grew million  or 
the primary contributors to the increase in rental and other property income are summarized in the following table 
for the years ended december  before before late late rental income growth fees late fees total fees late fees total in thousands preceding year acquisitions      preceding year developments     same store facilities      current year acquisitions     current year developments dispositions     other     the majority of the other rental income growth is attributed to prior period developed facilities still in the lease up phase  as well as expanded facilities 
the majority of the same store facilities revenue growth for was provided by an approximate increase in realized rent per square foot  from per square foot in to for physical occupancy during this period remained constant at 
for  a realized rent per square foot increase of  from to  contributed to the bulk of same store rental income growth  with occupancy again remaining constant  at  between and service income consists of revenue derived from providing services to third parties and related joint ventures 
these services include the management of self storage facilities  as well as general contractor  development and acquisition services provided to the ge capital development and acquisition ventures ge capital ventures 
following is a summary of service income for the years ended december   and in thousands management fees    general contractor fees development fees acquisition fees total service income    service income increased by million from to  and grew as a percentage of total income from to 
the bulk of the increase  million was due to the service fees received from the ge capital ventures 
the ventures had no activity until march  so there are no comparable general contractor  development or acquisition fees for the remaining increase  as well as the thousand increase from to  was due to fees received for managing facilities owned by third parties 
the number of managed or franchised properties remitting fees to the partnership has risen from at the conclusion of  to in  to in other income consists solely of the company s proportionate share of the net income of equity investments including joint ventures and franchise 
following is a summary of other income for the years ended december   and in thousands fidelity joint venture  ge joint ventures franchise other ventures total other income   total other income decreased thousand from to  or 
as was the case with service income  the equity loss recognized in relating to the ge capital ventures  thousand  has no comparable amount in due to the timing of the commencement of the ventures 
timing was also the primary factor in the thousand   increase in income from the fidelity venture 
the fidelity venture was formed in june  so only seven month s income was recorded as of december  compared to a full year in the decrease in income from franchise  thousand  was primarily due to increases in losses recognized on equity participations in franchised facilities and a decrease in overall general contracting fees 
from to  other income grew million  or 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of property operations and maintenance decreased from in to in  and then increased to in actual expenses rose million  or in  and million  or in the trend for the cost of property operations as a percentage of revenues is to decrease over time due to same store facility revenue growth outpacing expense growth 
this happened in  and was generally the case in  with some exceptions 
first  the impact of our reduction in late fees was apparent  reducing income  and thereby increasing the percentage of property operations costs 
second  salary expense increased between the two periods  primarily due to two strategic initiatives commencing in the national reservation center and the internal information technology help desk 
these departments started operations in  and had gradually increasing expenses as staffing progressed 
comparatively  year contains expenses for these two mature departments for a full year 
health insurance expense also showed a significant increase  due to increased claims and participating employees  following what we believe is a national trend 
we expect this trend to continue  and estimate a to increase in health insurance costs for property and liability insurance costs were also significantly higher than in effective july   higher premiums went into effect relating to our renewal of this coverage for the policy period july  through june  we expect these premiums to increase again from to 
premiums over the twelve month period will be approximately thousand higher that those that were in place under the previous policy 
finally  utility expenses exceeded those of due to the unusually mild winter in tax expense as a percentage of revenues was in  in and in tax expense as a percentage of revenues trends down as a result of revenue growth outpacing tax expense growth 
in  a number of our larger properties were reassessed by their respective tax jurisdictions  causing an increase in expense  and offsetting any decrease caused by revenue growth 
the normal trend began to reassert itself again in  as total taxes increased only thousand  or  substantially less than the total revenue growth 
taxes in increased million  or 
costs of providing services increased million from to  and increased as a percentage of revenues from to 
these costs increased million from to  and increased as a percentage of revenues from to 
this was due primarily to the new services provided in  general contracting  development and acquisition services  and their corresponding costs 
the costs of providing management services also increased as more managed franchised properties were added to the storage usa system between december of and general and administrative expenses g a as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in  and then back down to in actual expenses increased million from to  or  but decreased from to by thousand  or 
the growth in g a was attributable to the continued expansion of our administration  acquisition and development  management information systems  human resources  and legal departments in connection with the implementation of our internal and external growth strategies 
these expenses leveled off in also impacting growth was thousand of expense recognized in connection with a tennessee law enacted in that subjected limited partnerships and limited liability corporations to the tennessee excise and franchise tax 
during the second quarter of  the state of tennessee passed legislation that granted reits substantial relief from this law 
the legislation was retroactive to the beginning of and substantially eliminated the applicability of the tennessee excise and franchise taxes to us 
fiscal year g a was also positively impacted by the classification of development  construction and acquisition department overhead as part of the cost of providing services  continued benefits from various cost containment programs and lower management bonus accruals 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense by million in and million in primarily reflects our acquisition of approximately million of depreciable assets in  and million in interest income and expense are netted together and the breakout of income and expense is as follows for the year ended december  in thousands interest income    interest expense    interest expense  net    interest expense increased million  or  from to  and increased million  or from to these interest expense increases were primarily from the sources listed in the table below and were offset by capitalized interest of million in  million in and million in weighted weighted weighted weighted weighted weighted average average average average average average debt borrowing interest rate borrowing interest rate borrowing interest rate in thousands notes payable    lines of credit    mortgages payable    leases other borrowings    interest income grew by thousand  or  in  compared to million  or  in approximately million of the increase in was from interest earned on advances from us to franchisees of franchise 
another thousand related to restricted escrow funds from the fidelity transaction 
the remainder of the increase was from interest earned on amounts outstanding under the employee stock purchase and loan plan and earnings on overnight deposits 
in  interest on loans to franchisees grew million 
although advances on loans to franchisees of franchise decreased from december  to  from million to million  weighted average advances actually increased from million in to million in interest rates on these loans also increased  reflecting the change in the prime rate 
restricted escrow funds from the fidelity transaction were used to acquire new self storage facilities in there was no interest connected with these funds in gains losses on exchange of storage facilities of million in  thousand in  and thousand in represent gains losses on the disposition of our investments in storage facilities that were exchanged for cash and other self storage facilities 
thousand of the gain relates to the sale of two columbus  indiana storage facilities  thousand to the sale of a non operating development project in white marsh  maryland to a franchisee  thousand to the sale of an operating facility in queens  new york  and the remaining thousand to adjustments from the resolution of contingencies on prior period acquisitions 
in we sold properties  including the in the fidelity joint venture 
the million gain on the fidelity transaction was deferred until such time as we dispose of interests in the fidelity venture 
the diverse group of properties involved in dispositions encompassed states and the district of columbia 
in we sold one property in california 
minority interest expense represents the portion of income allocable to holders of limited partnership interest in the partnership partnership units or units and distributions payable to holders of preferred units 
minority interest expense rose from million in to million in this increase of million  or  was due to the november issuance of million of preferred partnership units 
minority interest expense decreased to million in  a reduction of thousand  or from this was due to the decrease in net income between the two years  as well as a decrease in weighted average partnership units outstanding  from million in to million in liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in and million in these increases are primarily a result of the significant expansion of our property portfolio  including our owned properties  as well as our franchised and joint venture properties 
the items affecting the operating cash flows are discussed more fully in the results of operations section 
during fiscal year  we received million in proceeds from the disposition of self storage facilities 
million of the total proceeds related to our transfer of nine development projects to the ge capital development venture during the first quarter of we received an additional million for the sale of three operating properties  two land parcels and a development facility still under construction 
one of the operating properties was sold to the ge acquisition venture in which consideration included a note receivable for million 
the sale of the development facility also included a note receivable  of million 
of the million in proceeds from dispositions in  related to the properties transferred to the fidelity venture 
million of the million invested in acquisitions and improvements in also pertained to the fidelity venture  as proceeds from the initial transfer were redeployed in tax free exchanges for additional properties and development land parcels 
we invested cash totaling million in in the acquisition and improvement of self storage facilities compared to million during and million during million of the million invested in represents our investment in five acquired facilities 
an additional thousand in partnership units and million in assumed loans to former franchisees consummated the acquisitions 
the remaining million reflects improvements to existing self storage facilities and our corporate offices 
we invested cash of million in  million in  and million in for land held for development and construction of self storage facilities 
we also used cash of million in  million in and million in for advances and investments in real estate 
in  the total of million consisted of million in financing to franchisees of storage usa franchise corp franchise  and million in equity contributions to the ge capital joint ventures 
in  million was advanced to franchisees of franchise  and in equity contributions were made to the ge capital joint ventures 
the entirety of the million in represents loans to franchisees of franchise 
during  proceeds were also received from certain franchisees  as three repaid their loans during the period  generating million in cash 
franchisee loan repayments totaled million in  million in there were six development properties in process with million invested at december  the total budget for these projects is million  with remaining to be invested 
in addition to these development projects  we have expansions of existing facilities in process with a total of million invested at december  these projects have a total budget of million and will require an additional million investment 
we have million of loan commitments to franchisees to fund as of december  we also expect to invest during approximately million as part of our required equity contributions in the ge capital joint ventures 
as noted above  we sometimes acquire facilities in exchange for units 
the units are redeemable after one year for cash or  at our option  shares of our common stock 
sellers taking units instead of cash are able to defer recognizing a taxable gain on the sale of their facilities until they sell or redeem their units 
at december  we had million units outstanding  of which the following units were redeemable 
thousand units for an amount equal to the fair market value million  based upon a price per unit of at december  payable in cash or  at our option  by a promissory note payable in quarterly installments over two years with interest at the prime rate 

million units for amounts equal to the fair market value million  based upon a price per unit of at december  payable by us in cash or  at our option  in shares of our common stock at the initial exchange ratio of one share for each unit 
we anticipate that the source of funds for any cash redemption of units will be retained cash flow or proceeds from the future sale of our securities or other indebtedness 
we have agreed to register any shares of our common stock issued upon redemption of units under the securities act of between november and july  the partnership issued million of notes payable 
the notes are unsecured obligations of the partnership  and may be redeemed at any time at the option of the partnership  subject to a premium payment and other terms and conditions 
the combined notes carry a weighted average interest rate of and were issued at a price to yield a weighted average of 
the terms of the notes are staggered between seven and thirty years  maturing between and in december of  we announced a board authorized plan to repurchase up to of our common shares outstanding through open market and private purchases 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock at a total cost of million 
in  we completed the plan by buying back an additional million shares at a total cost of million 
in all  million shares were repurchased at a total cost of million  representing an average price of approximately per share 
we initially fund our capital requirements primarily through the available lines of credit with the intention of refinancing these with long term capital in the form of equity and debt securities when we determine that market conditions are favorable 
as of december   we can issue under currently effective shelf registration statements up to million of common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants and can also issue million of unsecured  non convertible senior debt securities of the partnership 
our lines of credit bear interest at various spreads over libor 
we had net borrowings of million in  million in and million in borrowings would have been greater in had we not used million of the proceeds received from the fidelity venture to reduce the lines of credit 
we currently have a million unsecured revolving credit line with a group of commercial banks  bearing interest at a spread of basis points over libor  based on our current debt rating  which matures in may of we also have a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line bears interest at a spread over libor  matures on july   and is renewable at that time 
additionally  in december of  franchise closed on a million unsecured line of credit with a commercial bank  which bears interest at a spread over libor  matures on december  and is renewable at that time 
franchise is fully drawn on the line as of december  our overall debt policy  which is subject to change at the discretion of our board of directors  is to limit total indebtedness to the lessor of of total assets at cost or that amount that will sustain a minimum debt service ratio of in november  we issued million of cumulative redeemable preferred partnership units in a private placement 
the proceeds from the issuance were used to pay down our line of credit 
we paid approximately million in dividends in compared to million in this was due to an increase of in the dividend rate  from to per share  between the two years 
preferred unit dividends also increased from to  from million to million 
distributions to minority interest decreased from million in to million in due to decreased total partnership units outstanding between the two periods  more than offsetting the rate increase corresponding to dividends 
we expect to incur approximately million for scheduled maintenance and repairs during the next twelve months and approximately million to conform facilities acquired from to to our standards 
in the second quarter of  we committed to several new leases relating to our corporate headquarters office space in memphis 
the leases have a term of fifteen years with estimated annual payments of million 
we have rented a portion of this space to others under several subleases at the same rent and substantially similar terms to our primary leases and expect to receive approximately thousand annually from such subleases 
we believe that borrowings under our current credit facilities combined with cash from operations will provide us with necessary liquidity and capital resources to meet the funding requirements of our remaining development and expansion pipeline  commitments to provide financing to franchisees  equity commitments of the ge capital joint ventures  and dividend and distribution requirements 
additionally  no significant maturities are scheduled under any of our borrowings until we are currently pursuing several strategies to generate additional cash funding in  including the disposition of individually targeted properties  issuing additional preferred partnership units and forming additional joint ventures 
funds from operations we believe funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income and cash flows to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as a measure of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
we follow the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit definition of ffo 
our ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits that calculate ffo differently 
in calculating ffo per share  we add back only depreciation and amortization of revenue producing property 
as such  our ffo and ffo per share may not be comparable to other reits that may add back total depreciation and amortization 
the following table illustrates the components of our ffo for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income    gain loss on sale of assets total depreciation amortization    depreciation from unconsolidated entities  less depreciation of non revenue producing assets    consolidated ffo    minority interest share of gain loss on exchange of asset minority interest share of depreciation from unconsolidated entities minority interest share of depreciation amortization    ffo available to common shareholders    weighted average diluted shares    dividends per share payout ratio excludes gain on sale of undepreciated land in the first quarter of at its meeting on october   the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit clarified that ffo should include non recurring results of operations  except those defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the clarification of ffo was effective january  since we have historically not added back non recurring items to our calculation  the modification of the ffo definition did not have a material impact on previously reported ffo information 
during  we declared dividends per share of  which is an increase of over the dividend per share of 
dividends per share increased from to as a qualified reit  we are required to distribute a substantial portion of our net income as dividends to our shareholders 
while our goal is to generate and retain sufficient cash flow to meet our operating  capital and debt service needs  our dividend requirements may require us to utilize our bank lines of credit and other sources of liquidity to finance property acquisitions and development  and major capital improvements

forward looking statements and risk factors all statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section that are not historical facts are based on our current expectations 
this includes statements regarding anticipated future development and acquisition activity  the impact of anticipated rental rate increases on our revenue growth  our anticipated revenues  expenses and returns  and future capital requirements  among others 
words such as believes  expects  anticipate  intends  plans and estimates and variations of such words and similar words also identify forward looking statements 
such statements are forward looking in nature and involve a number of risks and uncertainties and  accordingly  actual results may differ materially 
the following factors  among others  may affect the company s future financial performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
changes in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate  such as unexpected increases in supply and competition  unexpected changes in financial resources of our customers  or unexpected increases in prevailing wage levels or in insurance  taxes or utilities  could negatively impact our ability to raise our rents and control our expenses  thus reducing our net income 

competition for development or acquisition sites could drive up costs  making it unfeasible for us to develop or acquire properties in certain markets 

new development opportunities could be limited due to an inability to obtain zoning and other local approvals 

amounts that we charge for late fees have been and are the subject of litigation against us and are  in some states  the subject of governmental regulation 
consequently  such amounts could decrease  materially affecting the results of operations 

the conditions affecting the bank  debt and equity markets could change  increasing our cost of capital or reducing its availability on terms satisfactory to us  either of which could reduce our returns or restrict our growth 

costs related to compliance with laws  including environmental laws could increase  reducing our net income 

general business and economic conditions could change  adversely affecting occupancy and rental rates  thereby reducing our revenue 

unfavorable outcome s in the pending litigation described in item of this form k could ultimately reduce our net income 

changes in tax laws or market conditions could make real estate investment less attractive relative to other investment opportunities 
such changes would reduce the number of buyers for real estate and adversely affect real estate asset values 

construction costs and the timing of a development project may exceed our original estimates  resulting in reduced returns on investment and delayed realization of returns 

the level of on balance sheet development could exceed current expectations resulting in higher than anticipated dilution to our earnings 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information  subsequent events or any other circumstances 
such statements speak only as of the date that they are made 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates on existing variable rate debt and the repricing of fixed rate debt at maturity 
we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing under our lines of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately thousand during  based on balances outstanding during the year ending december
