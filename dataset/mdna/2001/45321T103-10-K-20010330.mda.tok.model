the following table shows our revenues by operating subsidiary including intercompany transactions year ended december  in thousands impsat argentina services broadband network development impsat colombia impsat venezuela impsat brazil services broadband network development other services broadband network development other includes impsat ecuador  impsat mexico  impsat usa  impsat chile  impsat peru and  prior to  mandic sa on october   we sold the retail dial up internet business of mandic to el sitio  inc  and merged mandic s remaining operations into impsat brazil 
our broadband network development revenues of million for  which we discussed above  were recorded upon our delivery to  and provisional acceptance by  global crossing of those segments of the tac between global crossing s submarine cable landing point at las toninas  argentina and santiago  chile and other backhaul segments in brazil and peru 
these revenues included a bonus payment of million earned under our contract with global crossing for early delivery of the tac segment 
we delivered the final segment of the tac  between santiago  chile and global crossing s submarine landing point at valparaiso  chile  in march 
table of contents growth in our revenues from services resulted primarily from broadband data services  internet services and equipment sales 
the following table shows our revenues from services by business lines after elimination of intercompany transactions for the periods indicated december  change change change dollar amounts in thousands data and value added services broadband satellite other total internet services to carriers equipment sales broadband network development total net revenues increase decrease compared to previous year 
despite the continued economic stagnation that we experienced during in many of our countries of operation  including argentina and colombia  we were able to achieve services revenue growth of for as compared to our services revenue growth was achieved principally because of an overall increase in the number of customers and services we provided  offset in part by decreasing prices 
excluding fax store and forward customers  we had  customers at december   compared to  customers at december  as we continue marketing services over our broadband network  we intend to continue to aggressively market our services to existing and new customers  including smaller and medium sized corporate customers who desire to contract for capacity on our broadband network for their telecommunications needs 
in  we gained a total of new customers  an increase of from we expect that the average revenues from many of our newer customers will be less than those realized in the past from our larger corporate and governmental customers 
customer growth was most pronounced in argentina and brazil  where the bulk of our marketing and sales efforts are taking place in connection with the introduction of service on our broadband network 
our operations in brazil recorded the highest revenue growth rate for services revenues among our countries of operation 
net revenue from services relating to our brazilian operations during totaled million  an increase of million or compared to in brazil  the increase in our net revenues from services resulted from increased data and value added services to our expanding customer base and from increased revenues for internet access services to the us internet backbone 
during  we entered into several contracts with brazilian telecommunications companies for access to the us internet backbone 
our net revenue from services in argentina for totaled million  an increase of million or from while our revenue in argentina from our satellite based network services declined as compared to  our broadband data and value added services revenues and internet services revenues increased 
the decline in revenue from satellite based network services is due to the continuing trend among our customers and business segment for higher bandwidth services  increased competition and continued downward pressure on pricing for low and medium bandwidth service offerings 
the increase in internet services resulted from several new contracts entered into for access to the us internet backbone 
our growth of internet access services in argentina included the commencement of such service to aol argentina srl  an affiliate of america online  inc  upon aol argentina s launch in august of in addition  impsat argentina s services revenues for included million in equipment sales 
this amount related principally to a contract entered into in january with the government of the province of cordoba for the provision of equipment and information technology solutions for the automation and updating of the province s revenue collection and auditing functions 
it is our goal to utilize contracts for the development of 
table of contents systems integration services and related equipment sales to become the telecommunications provider of choice for clients desiring to outsource their integrated telecommunications needs 
our improved results in brazil and argentina were offset by a decrease in services revenue at impsat colombia 
during the  our operations in colombia  our second oldest market  continued to be adversely affected by that country s economic recession  which intensified pricing pressures 
impsat colombia s services revenue totaled million for  a million or decrease from due to the recession in colombia  a number of our customers either cancelled their contracts with us or reduced the amount of services contracted 
in january  we announced the acquisition by impsat colombia of the customer contracts of americatel sa  the private network telecommunications service provider owned by the grupo santo domingo  one of colombia s largest business conglomerate 
we expect that our revenues in colombia will improve slightly throughout the course of as a result of our acquisition of americatel s customer contracts and the marginal improvement anticipated for the colombian economy 
direct costs 
our direct costs for totaled million 
this amount includes million in direct costs associated with the construction and delivery of the tac segments and other backhaul links delivered to global crossing during  which amounts related principally to cost of equipment and contracted third party construction services 
other costs related to our turnkey contracts with global crossing  including salary and sg a expenses  have been accrued and recorded in the periods in which such expenses were incurred  and reported among our expenses from general operations 
excluding direct costs related to the broadband network development for global crossing  our direct costs for totaled million  an increase of million or compared to of these direct costs for  million related to the operations of impsat argentina 
this compares to million at impsat argentina for direct costs for our brazilian operations totaled million for  compared to million for direct costs of our subsidiaries are described prior to the elimination of intercompany transactions 
contracted services 
contracted services costs include costs of maintenance and installation and de installation services provided by outside contractors 
during  contracted services costs totaled million  an increase of million or from of this amount  maintenance costs for our telecommunications network infrastructure totaled million for  compared to million during our maintenance costs increased because we had more infrastructure 
in addition  our installation costs totaled million for  compared to million for we expect that our contracted services costs will increase in as we migrate clients in argentina and brazil to the broadband network from their existing satellite based equipment and as we add new clients to the broadband network  we will incur higher de installation and installation costs 
in addition  we will incur associated utility and maintenance costs for our broadband network  including our state of the art data centers and our telehouses 
management is considering whether such broadband network maintenance services will be contracted from third parties or whether we will hire qualified personnel to perform such services 
other direct costs 
other direct costs principally include licenses and other fees  sales commissions paid to third party sales representatives  and our allowance for doubtful accounts 
sales commissions paid to third party sales representatives for totaled million  compared to million for the majority of these commissions related to customers of impsat argentina 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of million compared to a provision for doubtful accounts of million for during  we obtained payment of certain past due receivables from certain customers in argentina and colombia totaling million 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts for related principally to a change in our provisioning policy 
at december   approximately of our gross trade accounts receivable were past due more than six months compared to approximately for at december   average days of gross trade accounts receivable equaled days  compared to days at december  while we analyze the creditworthiness of our customers and potential customers prior to entering into service contracts  we 
table of contents expect that as we expand our client base in the future upon the development of the broadband network  including services to small and medium size corporate customers  our provisions for doubtful accounts will increase 
leased capacity 
our leased capacity costs for totaled million  which represents an increase of million or from we had approximately  mhz of leased satellite capacity at december  and mhz at december  the expansion of our satellite capacity was primarily attributable to contractually scheduled increases in satellite capacity to match anticipated growth in customer demand 
as we migrate certain of our customers in argentina and brazil to the broadband network in  we expect that the increase in satellite capacity costs will decline in percentage terms as compared to prior years and as a percentage of revenues in those countries 
in addition  to satisfy increasing customer demand for higher bandwidth telecommunications links  during we increased our leased dedicated capacity on third party fiber optic networks  spending million for  an increase of million or from these costs were incurred principally in argentina  brazil and the united states 
we incurred these higher costs of leased fiber optic capacity in argentina and brazil due to the continued demand by some of our customers for greater bandwidth while we were deploying our broadband network and in the united states due to the expansion of our internet service offerings in latin america where we provide a link between latin america and the us internet backbone 
as we further deploy the broadband network during  we anticipate transferring increasing amounts of our telecommunications traffic to the broadband network 
we believe that our leased satellite and fiber optic capacity costs will continue to increase in in absolute terms but that the rate of growth in such costs will decrease and that such costs should decrease as a percentage of revenues 
we will continue to require leased capacity to provide telecommunications services to clients with facilities outside of the footprint of our broadband network in order to provide end to end telecommunications services 
in connection with certain new services which we are offering in as a result of the implementation of our broadband network and the effectiveness of our new license in argentina to provide domestic and international long distance services  we will incur costs for interconnection and telephony termination costs and frequency rights 
pursuant to regulations adopted in argentina in connection with the de monopolization of telephony in november  the argentine government adopted a rate of per minute for interconnection charges for new telephony providers to terminate calls with other providers 
costs of equipment sold 
excluding cost of equipment related to our broadband network development costs for global crossing  we incurred costs of equipment sold in of million  a million or increase from salaries and wages 
salaries and wages for totaled million  an increase of million or from the increase resulted primarily from an increase in the number of employees  from  at december  to  at december   particularly in connection with the expansion of our operations in brazil and the development of the broadband network  and increases in the salaries  wages and recruiting costs of our personnel to match market rates for personnel with the expertise we require and increases in cost of living

these amounts represent an increase of million and million or and from the corresponding periods during impsat brazil increased its number of employees to persons at december   compared to persons at december  because many of these new personnel commenced employment only 
table of contents towards the end of the third quarter  the impact of the increase in the number of employees was not recognized in our salaries and wages expenses until the fourth quarter of we expect salaries and wages expenses to increase as we expand our business over the broadband network in argentina and brazil 
we also expect to increase the number of employees throughout  although at a much lower level than during however  because most of our recruitment and hiring for the operation of the broadband network has now been completed  we expect that increases in our salaries and wages costs in future periods will decline as percentage of revenues for such periods as compared to prior periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our sg a expenses consist principally of publicity and promotion costs professional fees and other remuneration travel and entertainment rent  and plant services  telephone and energy expenses 
we incurred sg a expenses of million for sg a expenses increased million or from sg a expenses at impsat argentina for totaled million  an increase of million or from sg a expenses incurred by impsat argentina for compared to  the increase in sg a expenses reflect higher publicity and promotion expenses  travelling expenses and advisory services related to the deployment of the broadband network 
we expect sg a expenses to continue to increase as we grow our operation of the broadband network and seek to expand our customer and services base to take advantage of our new infrastructure 
the operation of the broadband network and the development of a new structure for sales and customer expansion  including sales to small and medium size corporate customers  will cause higher levels of sg a expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expenses for totaled million  a decrease of million or compared to our depreciation and amortization for depreciation and amortization for impsat argentina for totaled million 
the decrease in our depreciation and amortization expense reflects our decision at the end of the third quarter of to change the depreciable life of some of our customers premises telecommunications equipment in light of technological advances  which resulted in a one time depreciation and amortization charge in that quarter 
depreciation and amortization expenses will increase in future periods due to the development of the broadband network and our acquisition of additional associated customer premises equipment 
we monitor technological advances to determine whether additional adjustments in the depreciable life of certain of our telecommunications equipment will be appropriate in future periods

broadband network 
during  we deployed our new broadband network in argentina  brazil and chile 
our broadband network  which is comprised of  kilometers of long haul fiber optic backbones and kilometers of metropolitan area fiber optic and wireless links  stretches from the pacific ocean at valparaiso  chile to the atlantic ocean  at las toninas  argentina and between curitiba  rio de janeiro  s o paulo and belo horizonte  brazil 
the broadband network  which uses advanced transmission technologies including dense wave division multiplexing dwdm  asynchronous transfer mode atm and internet protocol ip  links major metropolitan areas throughout argentina and brazil along the long haul routes and includes fiber optic and wireless metropolitan area local loops in those cities 
in addition  we own and operate a  route kilometer long haul fiber optic network in colombia 
we are currently constructing an additional link between parana  argentina and curitiba  brazil to create the first high speed broadband network connecting argentina  brazil and chile which will be ready for operation by the end of at the end of this year  we expect that the broadband network will extend  kilometers of long haul fiber optic backbones and  kilometers of metropolitan area backbones 
in order to provide our customers with connectivity to other parts of the latin american region and worldwide and to expand the reach of the broadband network  we have acquired on an indefeasible right of use iru basis capacity on undersea submarine cables that enable us to link our broadband network to other parts of latin america  north america  europe and asia 
we have a total of approximately  square feet of advanced data center space in argentina  brazil  chile  mexico and the united states 
our data centers will complement our existing hosting facilities  which collectively occupy approximately  square feet of building space in those countries 
revenues 
during  our revenues were derived from five principal types of services 
those telecommunications services were i data and value added services  ii internet services  iii services to carriers  iv sales of equipment  and v broadband network development services 
with the exception of the broadband network development services revenues  the final installment of which we expect to receive during the first half of  our revenues for and thereafter will be concentrated along these lines of service 
with respect to data and value added services and internet services  we provide those services to our customers under contracts which typically range from six months to five years  but generally are for three years 
where applicable  the customer generally pays an installation charge at the beginning of the contract  and thereafter the customer pays a monthly fee based on the quantity and type of equipment installed and the type and level of telecommunications capacity provided 
except in brazil  the fees stipulated in the contracts are generally denominated in us dollar equivalents 
services other than installation fees are billed on a monthly or quarterly  predetermined basis  which coincide with the rendering of the services 
we report our revenues net of deductions for sales taxes 
with the introduction and commissioning of our broadband network  we have commenced the sale of wholesale connectivity services to other telecommunications carriers on an iru and other long term basis 
in  we entered into iru sales with global crossing over portions of our broadband network in argentina  brazil and peru  and in february entered into iru sales with networks  inc over portions of our broadband network in argentina  brazil and chile 
we have or will receive fixed advance payments for the irus upon the execution of the iru capacity agreements and the initiation into service of the irus and will recognize revenue from the iru sales ratably over the life of the iru  which we expect generally will cover a 
table of contents period of to years 
amounts received in advance and not recognized in a particular reporting period are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets 
as part of our service offerings to telecommunications carriers  we will provide iru maintenance services and collocation services in our telehouses located in the major metropolitan areas of the countries in which we are located 
iru maintenance services and collocation services will be billed on a monthly or quarterly predetermined basis and recognized upon the provision of the services

we record revenue from equipment sales upon delivery and acceptance by our customers 
finally  during  we recorded broadband network development revenues from our turnkey construction for global crossing of certain dedicated ducts for the terrestrial portions of global crossing s southern crossing system 
these portions included the construction of ducts and other backhaul provisioning between the submarine cable landing points of global crossing s southern crossing in argentina  brazil  chile and peru 
revenues relating to our broadband network development for global crossing were recorded upon our delivery to  and provisional acceptance by  global crossing of the respective terrestrial segments 
we recorded revenues of million for this construction in and expect to finish the delivery of the contracted segments during the first half of we do not currently have any additional plans to enter into similar contracts in the future with global crossing or other parties 
we have experienced  and anticipate that we will continue to experience  downward pressure on our prices for our telecommunications service offerings as we continue to expand our customer base and as competition for telecommunications services grows upon the continuing deregulation of the telecommunications sector in latin america 
when we have renewed and or expanded our contracts with existing customers  the prices we charge have generally declined 
we believe  however  that our construction and operation of the broadband network will help us to improve our competitive position in the latin american telecommunications sector by enabling us to offer new higher bandwidth products and services to a wider array of existing and new customers 
costs and expenses 
our costs and expenses principally include direct costs salaries and wages selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
our direct costs include payments for leased satellite transponder and fiber optic capacity  interconnection and termination costs for our new telephony offerings and frequency rights 
building the broadband network will decrease our payments for leased capacity as a percentage of revenues 
however  we will continue to incur leased capacity and related costs in order to address our customers telecommunications needs in areas beyond the geographical reach of our broadband network 
the other principal items comprising direct costs are contracted services costs and other direct costs 
contracted services costs include costs of maintenance and installation and de installation services provided by outside contractors 
beginning in  we will incur additional maintenance costs with respect to the broadband network 
installation and de installation costs are the costs we incur when we install or remove earth stations  microstations and other equipment from customer premises 
other direct costs principally include licenses and other fees sales commissions paid to third party sales representatives  and 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our selling  general and administrative expenses consist principally of publicity and promotion costs professional fees and other remuneration travel and entertainment rent  and plant services and corporate telecommunication and energy expenses 
currency risks 
except in brazil  our contracts with customers generally provide for payment in us dollars or for payment in local currency linked to the exchange rate between the local currency and the us dollar at the time of invoicing 
accordingly  inflationary pressures on local economies in the other countries in which we operate did not have a material effect on our revenues during given that the exchange rate is generally set at the date of invoicing and that we in some cases experience substantial delays in collecting receivables  we are exposed to exchange rate risk 
furthermore  under brazilian law  our contracts with customers in brazil cannot be linked to the exchange rate between the brazilian real and the us dollar 
our expansion in brazil will increase our exposure to exchange rate risks 
to date  we have not hedged any of these exposures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the sections below highlight our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks and change in the market values of our investment in equity securities 
the analyses presented below are illustrative and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance 
additionally  we cannot assure you that our actual results in any particular year will not differ from the amounts indicated below 
however  we believe that these results are reasonable based on our financial instrument portfolio at december  and assuming that the hypothetical interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes used in the analyses occurred during year we do not hold or issue any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than days 
as a result of the short term nature of these instruments  we do not believe that a hypothetical change in interest rates would have a material impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would also have an immaterial impact on the fair values of these instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate indebtedness  which affects our cost of financing 
our floating rate indebtedness has increased and is expected to increase further as we draw down commitments under the nortel financing agreements to cover expenditures relating to our contracts with nortel to construct the broadband network in argentina and brazil 
our actual interest rate is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business requirements 
we do not believe such risk is material and we do not customarily use derivative instruments to adjust interest rate risk

table of contents foreign currency risk 
a substantial portion of our costs  including lease payments for satellite transponder capacity  purchases of capital equipment  and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness  is payable in us dollars 
to date  we have not entered into hedging or swap contracts to address currency risks because our contracts with our customers generally provide for payment in us dollars or for payment in local currency linked to the exchange rate between the local currency and the us dollar at the time of invoicing 
these contractual provisions are structured to reduce our risk if currency exchange rates fluctuate 
however  given that the exchange rate is generally set at the date of invoicing and that in some cases we experience substantial delays in collecting receivables  we are exposed to exchange rate risk 
pursuant to brazilian law  our contracts with customers in brazil cannot be denominated in dollars or linked to the exchange rate between the brazilian real and the us dollar 
our expansion in brazil  including our development of the broadband network in brazil  has  and will continue to  increase our exposure to exchange rate risks 
revenues from services from our brazilian operations for and represented approximately and of our total net revenues from services for and for  respectively 
however  this proportion can be expected to increase significantly in future periods in connection with the progression of our operations in brazil and the development of the broadband network 
at march   the real traded at a rate of r 
we do not believe that a hypothetical devaluation in the market exchange rate of the real over the remaining eight and one half months ending december  would result in a material reduction in potential revenues from our brazilian operations during changes in market value of investment 
we hold a fair value basis investment of approximately of the common stock of el sitio  inc  which is publicly traded on the nasdaq national market system 
our investment in el sitio is subject to equity price and overall stock market risk 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our el sitio investment is included in non current assets and is accounted for as available for sale securities under sfas no 
because our ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over el sitio s operations 
our investment in el sitio  which is in the internet industry  is subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
a hypothetical decrease in the share price of el sitio s common stock from the price at december  would decrease the fair value of our investment by million 
on october   el sitio announced that it had entered into an agreement with affiliates of ibero american media partners ii ltd  a joint venture between the cisneros group of companies and hicks  muse  tate furst incorporated  to combine el sitio s interactive assets with ibero american media partners media assets in the latin american region to form a new company to be called claxson interactive group 
as part of the combination  our shares in el sitio would be converted into an equal number of shares in claxson interactive group 
we have agreed with ibero american media partners to vote our shares of el sitio common stock in favor of the combination 
el sitio has announced that it expects that the combination will be consummated in the first half of in the future  we may make additional equity investments in other privately or publicly held corporations for business and strategic purposes
