the company used approximately million during the year ended december  to fund the activities of its research and development programs and costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals  clinical testing and manufacturing process validation

we estimate that based on historical levels of spending and revenues  giving effect to the recent fielding acquisition noted above  and without giving effect to any future financing  existing cash resources will be sufficient to finance our operations for approximately to months 
past spending levels are not necessarily indicative of future spending 
future expenditures for product development  including these related to outside testing and human clinical trials  are discretionary and accordingly  can be adjusted to available cash 
as we continue to progress in our clinical development activities and commercial scale up of product manufacturing  we anticipate future increases in spending associated with these activities 
moreover  we may seek to establish additional collaborations with industry partners  to defray the costs of clinical trials and other related activities 
we will also consider sources of additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing  collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies  government agency contracts or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding or bank financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms to permit successful commercialization of all our technologies and products
