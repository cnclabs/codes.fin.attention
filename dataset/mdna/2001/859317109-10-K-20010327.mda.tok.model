item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides management s analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of sterling financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of lancaster county  na and its wholly owned subsidiary  town county  inc  t c leasing  inc  the first national bank of north east  bank of hanover and trust company  hovb investment co 
and sterling mortgage services  inc  which is presently inactive 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include the information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of sterling  and its subsidiaries  or the combined company 
when we use words such as believes  expects  anticipates or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
shareholders should note that many factors  some of which are discussed elsewhere in this report  could affect the future financial results of sterling and its subsidiaries  both individually and collectively  and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in this report 
these factors include the following operating  legal and regulatory risks  economic  political and competitive forces affecting our banking  leasing  securities  asset management and credit services businesses  the risk that our analysis of these risks and forces could be incorrect and or that the strategies developed to address them could be unsuccessful  and the success of our merger of hanover bancorp  inc sterling undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents sterling files periodically with the securities and exchange commission  including quarterly reports on form q and any current reports on form k 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last few years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is always present given changing trends in the economy 
one of the greatest external influences that impacts financial institutions is the interest rate environment 
beginning in the latter half of  which continued through  the federal reserve incrementally raised interest rates 
at december  the prime lending rate stood at 
this rate was increased three times during  including basis points in february and march  and basis points in may 
as a result  the prime lending rate increased basis points during and finished the year at 
the rising interest rate environment dictated by the federal reserve had an immediate impact on increasing funding costs and compressing the net interest margin 
management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  remains a critical responsibility in ensuring continuing profitability of the corporation 
aside from those matters described above  management does not believe that there are any trends or uncertainties which would have a material impact on future operating results  liquidity or capital resources nor is it aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have such an effect

in returns on average equity  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  were in  in  and in returns on average assets  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  totaled in  in  and in during  sterling made two decisions that will strategically position the organization to enhance shareholder value 
first  the merger with hanover bancorp  inc  was completed in july  and provided sterling with an entrance into york and adams counties  pennsylvania  and westminster  maryland 
second  it was determined that a common core processing system will be implemented at all three banking subsidiaries  and should be completed by the third quarter of once implemented  the system will provide customers increased flexibility  greater variety of products offered  and a larger network of delivery channels 
additionally  the common system will allow synergies to be achieved in administrative and operational areas of the organization 
these initiatives resulted in after tax merger related and restructuring charges of  net interest income the primary source of sterling s traditional banking revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets 
earning assets include loans  securities  federal funds sold 
interest bearing funds include deposits and borrowings 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
due to demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread  as these funding sources are noninterest bearing 
table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december   and table analyzes the changes in net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
tax equivalent net interest income in was  compared to  in and  in sterling has been able to increase its net interest income over the last two years primarily through increases in average earning assets  offset somewhat by higher average interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin have experienced compression over the last three years 
the interest rate spread was in  down from in and in the net interest margin experienced similar declines  totaling in  down from in and in several factors impacted the net interest margin 
higher funding costs in a rising rate environment  combined with a liability sensitive interest rate risk position for all three years were the primary reasons for the compression in the margin 
additionally  the market area served by sterling is highly competitive  resulting in financial institutions pricing quality credits competitively in order to increase volume 
finally  the decline in net interest margin is due to greater reliance on third party borrowings to fund both finance and operating leases 
this impacts the margin in two ways 
first  third party funding tends to be more costly than the rates paid on deposit accounts  as noted by rate paid on third party borrowings during secondly  the interest expense associated with funding attributed to the operating lease portfolio increases interest expense  but the revenues earned on operating leases appear as rental income  and not interest income 
during the last quarter of  interest rates began decreasing slightly 
given sterling s liability sensitive position at december   the decrease in rates should help reduce the compression in net interest margin experience in however  the impact will not be realized immediately  due to the time lag between increase in rates and when the loan  security and time deposit portfolios begin seeing the impact of the increase 
additionally  competitive pricing pressures in the lending portfolio  combined with additional borrowings to fund operating lease volume will continue to mitigate the gains realized in the margin due to the decline in rates 
average earning assets were  in  an increase of over s balance of  average earning assets for totaled  strong loan growth was the primary contributor to the increase in average earning assets during these periods 
average loans exceeded billion for the first time  and totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  in and  in the favorable economic climate in sterling s market area has resulted in strong commercial loan demand  fueling the growth in the loan balances 
additionally  strong marketing efforts to professionals in the market area has resulted in increased referrals  as these professionals have a greater awareness of sterling s products and services 
sterling has also experienced growth in the consumer loan balances  as marketing campaigns are designed to increase selling of loan services to retail customers 
average securities were  in  versus  in and  in the increase in securities  in part  reflects the growth trends in loans and deposits during the years 
as deposit growth outpaced loan growth during the year  excess funding was used in the security portfolio 
another contributing factor to the growth in securities is that a subsidiary of sterling had employed leverage strategies in which funds were borrowed  primarily through the federal home loan bank  and invested in securities 
these strategies were implemented to increase net interest income 
average interest bearing liabilities were  in  up from  in and  in funding needs to support loan and lease growth led to the increase in interest bearing liabilities in and  with the continued shift in mix from lower cost demand and savings deposits to time deposits and borrowed money

management continues to believe that the wealth management division represents a significant growth opportunity for the corporation 
sterling will continue its concerted efforts to expand this business  including marketing efforts aimed at cross selling these services  and the hiring of experienced professionals 
although wealth management can generate new business  the value of assets under management is directly related to the stock market 
declines in the stock market could have an adverse impact on income from fiduciary activities

mortgage banking income totaled  in  compared to  in and  in the financial services industry has seen a significant reduction in mortgage loan refinancing volume over the last two years  a direct result of increases in fixed interest rates on conventional mortgage products 
the increase in rates  which began in the second half of  continued through the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  interest rates on conventional mortgages started to decline slightly  resulting in increased refinancing volume in the fourth quarter of as compared to previous quarters during the year

in  a bank subsidiary of sterling sold its credit card portfolio for a gain of  rental income on operating leases has increased from  in to  in this follows an increase of in over results 
the increase in rental income is primarily due to an increase in the number of units under operating leases  which totaled   and  as of december   and sterling recognizes that leasing operations represent a growth opportunity for the corporation and has committed resources to expand this business 
these resources include increased marketing efforts  not only in developing new customer relationships  but also in maintaining existing customer relationships 
additionally  the strong economy experienced over the last several years has led to our clients expanding their business operations  resulting in an increase in the number of new units leased within our customer base

additionally  the cost of health insurance  and in particular  prescription drug plans  continue to rise consistent with national trends 
net occupancy expense totaled  in   in and  in the increase experienced in was primarily the opening of three offices and moving one branch to a larger  more modern facility 
additionally  utilities increased for the year ended december  a direct result of rising fuel costs as well as a slightly colder winter 
the decrease in occupancy expense in versus was the result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated in that time frame  combined with only one new branch office opening during the year 
professional service expense totaled  for the year ended december   a decrease over results 
this followed a increase in professional service expense experienced in as compared to the generally higher levels of professional service expense can be attributed to sterling s increased frequency of contracting for specialized services 
through contracting certain services to third parties  sterling benefits from a greater degree of knowledge  experience  and resources than that which can be obtained internally 
during  professional services were slightly higher than the present levels  due to a banking subsidiary contracting the pc help desk and network administration functions to a third party  until a suitable replacement was found 
additionally  services were contracted for other initiatives  including  but not limited to  yk preparations 
depreciation on operating lease assets totaled  in   in  and  in the and increases noted in and are consistent with the and increases noted in rental income on operating leases  discussed above 
depreciation on operating lease assets as a percent of rental income on operating leases was approximately for all three years 
during the third quarter of  sterling completed its merger with hanover bancorp  inc and incurred  of merger related and restructuring charges 
the direct costs that resulted from the merger totaled  and consisted principally of legal  accounting  investment advising fees  as well as regulatory filing fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
in addition  sterling incurred restructuring costs totaling  which primarily consists of severance and related benefits  professional fees  termination fees related to non cancelable service contracts and asset write offs related to conversion of the banking subsidiaries into a common core processing system 
sterling expects the conversion of the banking subsidiaries into one common core processing system will result in operating efficiencies through better leveraging of technology  greater array of products being offered to customers  and better customer service 
the conversion to the new core processing system and resulting reduction in the workforce is expected to result in an estimated net annual savings of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately will be realized in and will be realized in years and beyond

other noninterest expenses totaled  during  versus  in and  in significant expense components in this category include marketing and advertising  postage  utilities  mac fees  and pennsylvania shares tax 
the increase in expense noted during was the direct result of sterling s overall growth  which requires many of these types of expenses to increase as well 
in  a banking subsidiary of sterling terminated its defined benefit pension plan and incurred  in expense related to this action and was the primary reason for the decrease experienced in operating expenses levels are often measured by the efficiency ratio  which expresses noninterest expense  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
operating leases significantly impact sterling s consolidated efficiency ratio  which tends to drive the ratio higher than is typically achieved on financial institutions with no similar operating lease portfolio 
in order to effectively monitor the efficiency ratio  sterling monitors it on its two operating segments community banking and related services and leasing 
the community banking segment s efficiency ratio was in  in and in the leasing segment s efficiency ratio was in  in  and in while the ratios showed improvements from to  a decline in the net interest margin and a higher level of expenses  result in a slight increase in the ratios in income taxes sterling recognized income taxes of  or of pre tax income  in income tax expense totaled  or of pretax income in  and  or of pre tax income in the variances from the federal statutory rate of are generally due to tax exempt income  investments in low income housing partnerships which qualify for federal tax credits  offset somewhat by certain non deductible merger related costs and state income taxes 
the decline in the effective tax rate during is a result of a significant reduction in pre tax income due to restructuring charges recorded during the year and increasing tax exempt income 
as the tax free income represents a larger portion of pre tax income  the effective tax rate was lowered 
financial condition average earning assets increased in to  from  in and  in solid growth in commercial loans  consumer loans  and finance leases contributed greatly to the increase in average earning assets 
additionally  sterling s security portfolio increased over the last three years  as a result of its funding exceeding the loan demand 
average funding sources  or interest bearing liabilities  increased in to  from  in and  in investment securities sterling utilizes investment securities to generate interest and dividend income  to manage interest rate risk  and to provide liquidity 
the growth in the security portfolio  in part  reflects the trends in loans  deposits  and borrowed funds during as deposit and borrowing growth outpaced loan growth during  excess funding was invested in the securities portfolio

asset quality sterling s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also reduces sterling s credit risk 
sterling s commercial  consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania and northern maryland 
as the majority of sterling s loans are located in this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
the unemployment rate in sterling s market area remained below the national average during additionally  reasonably low interest rates  a continuing strong economy and minimal inflation continued to support favorable economic conditions in the area 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans  accruing loans past due days or more and other foreclosed assets 
sterling s general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when management determines that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
when management places a loan on nonaccrual status  it reverses unpaid interest credited to income in the current year  and charges unpaid interest accrued in prior years to the allowance for loan losses 
sterling recognizes income on these loans only to the extent that it receives cash payments 
sterling typically returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time 
sterling categorizes a loan as restructured if it changes the terms of the loan such as interest rate  repayment schedule or both  to terms which it otherwise would not have granted originally 
table nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans december  nonaccrual loans     accruing loans  past due days or more    restructured loans     total non performing loans      foreclosed assets total non performing assets      nonaccrual loans interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income recorded ratios non performing loans to total loans 
non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets non performing assets to total assets as of december   total non performing assets totaled  an increase of  or from december  the increase in nonaccrual loans is primarily the result of three large credits that moved into nonaccrual status during two of these loans are secured by real estate  which mitigates the risk of loss associated with these credits 
as a result of the increase in nonaccrual loans  sterling experienced an increase in non performing loans to total loans outstanding  as well as non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets 
however  these levels are within acceptable limits and are consistent with sterling s peer group 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans which have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as nonperforming loans in the future 
total potential problem loans approximated million at december  additionally  outstanding letter of credit commitments totaling approximately million could result in potential problem loans if drawn upon 
the majority of these loans are secured by real estate with acceptable loan to value ratios 
allowance for loan losses sterling maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
quarterly  the company utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
this methodology  which has remained consistent for the past several years  results in an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
management assigns internal risk ratings to all commercial relationships with aggregate borrowings or commitments to extend credit in excess of  utilizing migration analysis for the previous eight quarters  management develops a loss factor test  which it then uses to estimate losses on impaired loans  potential problem loans and non classified loans 
when management finds loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest  it places those loans on the problem list  and evaluates them on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses 
management s analysis considers adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of underlying collateral  and prevailing market conditions 
if management determines that a specific reserve allocation is not required  it assigns the general loss factor to determine the reserve 
for homogeneous loan types  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous two years for each specific loan pool 
additionally  management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors  including the following trends in delinquency levels  trends in non performing and potential problem loans  trends in composition  volume and terms of loans  effects in changes in lending policies or underwriting procedures  experience ability and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  concentrations in lending activities  other factors that management may deem appropriate 
management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on the following criteria risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time 
management feels the above methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically updates the methodology discussed above  which reduces the difference between actual losses and estimated losses 
management bases the provision for loan losses  or lack of provision  on the overall analysis taking into account the methodology discussed above 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses is as follows table summary of loan loss experience years ended december  allowance for loan losses beginning balance      loans charged off during year commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer   lease financing total charge offs      recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer lease financing total recoveries net loans charged off   provision for loan losses     balance at end of year      ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ending allowance for loan losses to net loans charged off x x x x x net loans charged off to provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans outstanding allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the allowance for loan losses decreased  from  at december  to  at december  the allowance represents of loans outstanding at december   versus as of the prior year end 
net charge offs totaled  for the year ended december   versus  in  an increase of 
despite the slight increase in net charge offs  the reduction in the provision was considered appropriate  as it is reflective of another year of relatively low charge offs 
these low levels of charge offs  particularly in the consumer loan portfolio  resulted in lower reserve allocations 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses years ended december  loans loans loans loans loans to total to total to total to total to total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate mortgage and construction consumer      leases unallocated      total      the allocation of the allowance for loan losses between the various loan portfolios has changed over the past few years  consistent with the historical net loss experience in each of the portfolios 
the largest reserve allocation is to the commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio  which represents two thirds of the reserve balance 
although the reserve allocation to this portfolio has increased over the last two years  the reserve allocation as a percent of related loans has remained fairly consistent 
this nonhomogeneous loan portfolio continues to represent the greatest risk exposure to sterling  as the credits generally are significantly larger than the remainder of the portfolio and the related collateral is not as marketable 
additionally  other external factors such as competition for high rated credits have also been considered in allocating this reserve balance 
sterling sold its credit card portfolio in  which resulted in a significant improvement in net charge offs within the consumer loan portfolio 
the sale of the credit card portfolio combined with increased collection efforts also resulted in a decline in the consumer loan delinquencies 
as a result  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the consumer loan portfolio has declined since the allocation  and presently represents 
of the related december  loan balance 
management believes a decrease in the allocated reserve to the consumer loan portfolio is warranted  even in light of the increased consumer loan balances 
this reduction in allocated allowance is due to continued decreases in net charge offs and enhanced performance in this portfolio 
during  the reserve allocation related to the lease portfolio has decreased  not only in the dollar allocation  but also the allocation as a percent of related lease balance 
during  several leases were charged off  resulting in a lower number of leases requiring a reserve allocation than that required in over the past several years  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of outstanding loan balance has declined from at december  to at december  the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
the unallocated portion of the reserve results due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at the time 
the unallocated portion has declined from levels  due to a greater concentration of loans in the commercial  financial and agricultural sector  and a lower concentration in the less risky residential mortgage portfolio 
another factor that led to the reduction in the unallocated reserve was one particular lending relationship that entered nonaccraul status in  and resulted in a higher reserve allocation than sterling has typically experienced 
while management believes sterling s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  and management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
assets held for operating leases assets held for operating leases  net of accumulated deprecation  totaled  at december   an increase of  from the december  balance of  assets held for operating leases totaled  at december  the increase is a direct result of an increase in the number of units under operating leases  which totaled   and  as of december   and sterling recognizes that leasing operations represent a growth opportunity for the corporation and has committed resources to expand this business 
operating leases have residual value risk associated with them 
operating lease terms  including monthly rental payment and length of the lease  are established based upon the residual value  or the estimate of fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term 
if at the end of the lease term  the fair value of the leased property is less than the residual value calculated at lease origination  a loss on disposal could result 
sterling mitigates this risk through the utilization of proven anticipated values published by various industries  and in some instances  discussions with industry experts 
further  the lease terms include provisions that the lessee shares the risk of loss on disposal of equipment  up to of the residual value 
deposits sterling continues to rely heavily on deposit growth as the primary source of funds for lending activities 
average deposits increased  or million  in this increase is comparable with the growth noted in this growth has been achieved through the development of products that meets the needs of our customers and maintaining a competitive pricing structure 
sterling will continue to explore new products for its customers  to mitigate increased consumer preference for higher risk investments  such as mutual funds and equity securities 
an example of this is the development of a cash management product that was promoted to customers that historically had their balances swept into a non deposit product

long term debt totaled  at december   an increase of  from december  sterling increased its reliance on long term debt during  including utilization of long term debt to reduce its short term obligations 
the increase in long term debt was a direct result of the interest yield curve  in which rates on short term investments increased significantly throughout management believes that longer term obligations resulted in a better match for funding finance and operating leases and loan growth 
capital the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
sterling s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at each of the banking subsidiaries 
the primary source of additional capital to sterling is earnings retention  which represents net income less dividends declared 
during  sterling retained  or  of its net income 
stockholders equity also increased as a result of  in other comprehensive income  which relates exclusively to unrealized gains on securities available for sale 
as mentioned previously  sterling and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on sterling and the subsidiary banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  sterling and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require sterling and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
management believes  as of december  and that sterling and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and are categorized as well capitalized 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the subsidiary banks category

the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s cash outflows consist principally of dividends to shareholders and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its banking subsidiaries 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary banks 
the total amount of dividends that may be paid from the subsidiary banks to sterling totals  at december  sterling manages liquidity by monitoring projected cash inflows and outflows on a daily basis  and believes it has sufficient funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying degrees of business conditions 
new financial accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
this requirement is in contrast to previous accounting guidance  which does not require unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging purposes to be recorded in the financial statements 
the new statement does allow hedge accounting treatment for derivatives used to hedge various risks and sets forth specific criteria to be used to determine when hedge accounting can be applied 
hedge accounting treatment provides for changes in fair value or cash flows of both the derivative and the hedged item to be recognized in earnings in the same period 
statement no 
does not change the accounting for those derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship  considered trading derivatives  for which fair value changes are recorded through earnings as they occur

other provisions related to the transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities are effective for transactions occurring after march  the application of the new rules will not have a material impact on sterling s financial condition or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks which may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
sterling s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is an economic exposure to future net earnings and future value of equity capital that can occur based on changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is inherent  because as a financial institution  sterling derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates  and then reinvesting those funds into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
current pricing can be established to generate a specific spread  or net interest margin  of income to cover operating costs and produce expected profit to its shareholders 
interest rate risk occurs when financial market rates increase or decrease in the future 
if interest rates increase or decrease  there could be a positive or negative effect on future income 
the net interest margin spread could increase or decrease based on the level of risk taken by the corporation 
if earning assets can reprice faster than its funding sources  the risk position will generate more revenue in the future on the same asset base if rates increase and less revenue if rates decrease 
if funding sources reprice faster than earning assets  the opposite effect to income will occur on the same asset base with increasing and decreasing interest rates 
interest rate risk can also occur when fixed rate commitments are made for future dates 
management endeavors to control the exposure of earnings to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the asset liability committees of each bank subsidiary are responsible for these decisions 
the committees operate under management policies defining guidelines and limits on levels of risk 
these policies are approved by the boards of directors 
the committees measure risk exposure with modeling techniques which involve assumptions and estimates which inherently cannot measure with complete precision 
the corporation has a negative cumulative gap at one year in the future in the amount of million of earning assets 
this risk position would result in a decreasing net interest margin in the next year if market rates increase  since this volume of funding liabilities in excess of the volume of earning assets repricing in the next year would have a negative effect on income 
this position will generate more income or widen the net interest margin if rates decrease in the next year 
beyond one year the risk position is recaptured
