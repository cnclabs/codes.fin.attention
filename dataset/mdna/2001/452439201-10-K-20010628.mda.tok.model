management s plan to improve fiscal dvdplanet operating results 
in july  the company began expanding the dvdplanet employee base in anticipation of growth in dvd revenues through direct to consumer distribution via the internet 
the majority of the new employees hired were based in image s chatsworth  california corporate headquarters and not at dvdplanet s retail store and shipping facility in westminster  california 
from mid calendar and throughout calendar  competing internet retailers offered dvd programming to consumers at deep discounts  often at or below their actual cost  in an effort to capture new customers 
management believes that profitability for these internet retailers was ultimately sacrificed to obtain rapid revenue growth during this period 
although dvdplanet did lower its pricing to consumers with an additional discount from the suggested retail price  it did not eliminate its entire gross profit margin to match its competitors pricing 
management believes  in large part because of its of competitors pricing policies  dvdplanet s revenue growth has been below management s expectations 
during the company s third quarter ended december   the financial difficulties and related attrition experienced by certain internet dvd retailers led to generally increased pricing to consumers by the remaining internet dvd retailers 
management believes this recent overall pricing increase by dvdplanet s competitors has positively impacted recent dvdplanet internet based revenues  because the disparity in pricing between dvdplanet and its competitors has narrowed 
with lower than expected revenue growth and a significant increase in operating expenses  dvdplanet has sustained upwardly trending quarterly losses 
in response to this continued negative trend in the operating results of dvdplanet  management has developed an action plan the action plan to improve the operating results of dvdplanet with the goal of achieving positive cash flows and profitability 
the action plan principally involves a initiatives which have been implemented in march and b initiatives which will be implemented during the quarter ending june   and is described in more detail below image entertainment  inc a initiatives implemented in march achieved fulfillment of dvdplanet s orders out of the company s las vegas warehouse and distribution facility

in late january  dvdplanet reduced its staff by three full time employees and one part time employee 
management estimates the related annual savings will be approximately  in salary and benefits 
additionally  seven full time employees of dvdplanet were transferred to the company s domestic wholesale distribution segment  eliminating that segment s immediate need to increase staffing in the areas of production  selling and business to business web site development for the domestic wholesale distribution segment 
management estimates the savings to the dvdplanet segment by moving these employees will be approximately  in annual salary and benefits 
consolidated payroll expense will not be affected by this inter segment transfer of employees 
b initiatives to be implemented during the first quarter ending june  realignment of all customer service  retail sales and shipping functions at the westminster facility 
dvdplanet expects to significantly reduce staff levels and working hours of certain part time personnel as a result of this realignment  with an estimated segment salary and benefits savings totaling approximately  reduced from  range of savings minimum disclosed in form q for the period ended december  
change class of shipping on majority of shipments from united states postal service priority to first class mail 
management estimates the related annual segment shipping expense savings will be approximately  based upon historical segment shipping activity 
management further believes that this class of service is competitive with the current internet retailing competition 
management believes that the implementation of this action plan  as well as a continuing review of cost savings opportunities  will improve dvdplanet s cash flows and operating results for the fiscal year ending march  as compared to the results for the fiscal year ended march  included herein 
there can be no assurance image entertainment  inc that dvdplanet s operating results will improve as a result of implementing these initiatives or that the goal of achieving positive cash flows and profitability will be reached 
summary 
management believes that its projected cash flows from operations  borrowing availability under its lender revolving lines of credit  cash on hand and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet its projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if future cash flows to be generated from operations  future borrowing availability under its lender revolving lines of credit  its disc manufacturer revolving credit commitment and future cash on hand are insufficient to satisfy image s continuing licensing and acquisition of exclusive dvd programming which require significant advance royalty or distribution fee payments  the company will need to seek additional debt and or equity financing 
failure to obtain this additional financing could significantly restrict the company s growth plans 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all
