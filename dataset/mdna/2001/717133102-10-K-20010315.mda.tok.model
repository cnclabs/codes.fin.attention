as of december  and  we had  and  in cash and cash equivalents  respectively 
during  we completed one financing transaction totaling  and a significant portion of the proceeds were used for repayment of existing debt 
we had net borrowings of the revolving line of credit totaling  and repayments on term debt and capital leases totaled  we also used  to acquire property and equipment  mostly related to computer software and laboratory analyzers 
during  we had net repayments on the revolving line of credit of  we acquired  of property and equipment and we repaid term debt and capital lease obligations of  on april   we entered into a  financing lease agreement with a lessor to refinance certain modules of our unified database software project 
the lease agreement bears interest at and is payable over months 
the proceeds from the lease were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
on november   we entered into a  financing lease agreement with a lessor to refinance certain other modules of our unified database software project 
the lease agreement bears interest at and is payable over months 
the proceeds from the lease were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit and for capital expenditures 
these leases have been accounted for as capital leases 
on may   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement credit agreement with our bank 
the amended credit agreement reflects similar terms and conditions to the predecessor agreement covering our revolving line of credit and variable rate installment note installment note 
the amended credit agreement provides for borrowings under the revolving line of credit limited to of qualified accounts receivables up to a maximum of  is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets excluding computer software and carries a commitment fee equal to of the maximum line of credit 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  which  among others  require pharmchem to maintain certain ratios of working capital and net worth 
the credit agreement permits up to  of the revolving line of credit to be used to repurchase our common stock under our common stock repurchase program and permits the declaration and distribution of a dividend in connection with our stockholder rights plan 
on september   we entered into a  installment note with our bank 
the majority of the proceeds from the installment note were immediately used to pay off the amount outstanding under a separate  installment note with the same bank 
the installment note is subject to the terms and conditions of the amended credit agreement  currently bears interest at the prime rate plus and is payable over months 
at december   the calculated maximum that could be borrowed and the amount outstanding under the credit agreement were  and  respectively 
advances under the revolving line of credit carry interest at either the prime rate plus at december  or libor plus 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants except that we exceeded the limitation on annual capital expenditures  for which we obtained a waiver 
we anticipate that existing cash balances  amounts available under the credit agreement and funds to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations and budgeted capital expenditures through in november   our board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program whereby we are able to purchase up to  shares approximately of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated sales 
our bank has authorized up to million from our existing credit agreement to be used toward repurchase of our common stock under this program 
the repurchase program contains certain restrictions  including limitations on the quantity  bid price and timing of stock purchases 
as of december   no shares have been repurchased 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of opinion for certain issues a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
with certain exceptions  this interpretation is effective july  the adoption of interpretation no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
in june  the sec issued sab b which deferred the effective date of sab until the last quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  we performed a review of our revenue recognition policies and determined they are in compliance with sab in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
the statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement generally provides for matching the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of a the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or b the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
sfas no 
was to be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after september  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which defers the implementation of sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 will be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of sfas nos 
and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting operating results we are subject to a number of risks which could affect operating results and liquidity  including  among others  the following competition and customer contracts the market for drug testing services became increasingly competitive in the s  and continues to be competitive 
drug testing laboratories compete primarily on the basis of customer service technical capability price we compete for customer contracts against firms that may have greater financial  marketing  laboratory and related resources 
a majority of our sales arise out of competitively bid contracts  which are awarded based on technical superiority  customer service and price 
the failure to renew a significant contract  if not replaced by comparable contracts  could result in lower sales  lower profit margins  decreased cash flows and losses 
our contracts generally allow termination at the customer s discretion on short notice with little or no penalty 
many contracts provide for termination for convenience 
in addition  relatively few of our contracts call for minimum contract amounts or payments 
although in the past our customers generally have not exercised these early termination rights  there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future 
early termination of a substantial contract  if not replaced by comparable contracts  could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
pharmchek r drugs of abuse patch since  we have been investing in pharmchek r  a system which uses sweat to detect the use of illegal drugs 
to date  our sales of pharmchek r have not been material and there is no assurance that it will continue to be commercially accepted by existing or new customers or generate significant revenues in the future 
while the company that developed pharmchek r has obtained patents relating to its technology  there are various risks associated with the technology 
there is no assurance as to the validity of such patents that the products we market will be covered by such patents that competitors will not infringe upon such patents or successfully design similar or competing products that do not infringe upon such patents that the company that obtained the pharmchek r patents will continue to be able to deliver products to pharmchem or that an alternative supplier will be found customer concentration our two largest customers combined accounted for approximately of our sales in  and the loss of these contracts  if not replaced by comparable contracts  could result in lower sales  lower profit margins  decreased cash flows and losses 
we have in the past failed to renew significant contracts which has had adverse effects on pharmchem 
see competition and customer contracts above 
certification we are certified by samhsa  cap and a number of states to conduct drug testing using forensic procedures 
in addition  our texas and california laboratories are certified as discussed earlier in part i under certification and government regulation 
certification is essential to our business because some of our customers are required to use certified laboratories  and many of our customers look to certification as an indication of accuracy and reliability of results 
in order to remain certified  we are subject to frequent inspections and proficiency tests 
failure to meet any of the numerous certification requirements to which we are subject could result in suspension or loss of certification 
such suspension or loss of certification could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
seasonal trends and economic conditions seasonal trends to which drug testing laboratories are generally subject affect our operations 
in the past  testing volume tends to be higher in the second and third calendar quarters and lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters  primarily due to the hiring patterns of our public and private employer customer group which affect pre employment drug testing 
demand for our services is also dependent on general economic conditions 
recessionary periods generally result in fewer new hires  and therefore may lead to fewer pre employment drug tests for public and private employer customers 
similarly  customers may scale back their drug testing program in a tight labor market 
budget cuts at the federal  state or local level could reduce business from our public employer  criminal justice agency and government funded drug treatment program customers 
because expenses associated with maintaining our testing work force are relatively fixed over the short term  our profit margins tend to increase in periods of higher testing volume and decrease in periods of lower testing volume 
judicial decisions and government policy state and federal courts have generally permitted the use of drug testing under certain circumstances and using certain procedures 
however  challenges to drug testing programs are raised from time to time by employees  unions and other groups in litigation on constitutional  privacy and other grounds 
in addition  legal precedent in a number of states governs the circumstances under which employers may test employees and the procedures under which such tests must be conducted 
although we believe that  to date  no such litigation or law has had a material adverse impact upon our business  new decisions  legislation or policies which restrict the use of drug testing could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
credit availability we maintain a revolving credit agreement with a bank 
all borrowings are secured by a lien on all of our assets excluding computer software 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  which we anticipate being able to comply with throughout  although there can be no assurance that such compliance will be maintained 
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business  we are sued by individuals  primarily those in the criminal justice system  who have tested positive for drugs of abuse 
in addition  we frequently testify in administrative and court proceedings involving the results of our tests 
to date  we have not experienced any material liability related to these claims  although there can be no assurance that we will not at some time in the future experience significant liability in connection with such claims 
environmental matters a small portion of our business involves testing procedures requiring the use of chloroform and radioactive reagents  which are considered to be hazardous materials 
failure to comply with current or future federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations regarding these hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
we believe we are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
dependence on key personnel our success is dependent in part on our key management and technical personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on pharmchem 
none of our key employees has an employment contract with us 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk with respect to our debt outstanding and foreign currency transactions 
our revolving line of credit and bank installment note carry interest at the prime rate plus 
as the prime rate increases  we will incur higher relative interest expense and a decrease in the prime rate will reduce relative interest expense 
in recent years  there have not been significant fluctuations in the prime rate 
assuming levels of debt consistent with historical amounts  a change in the prime rate would not materially change interest expense 
due to our international operations  certain transactions are conducted in foreign currencies 
medscreen s transactions are denominated approximately in pound sterling and in us currency 
during and  medscreen s net sales represented of our total net sales and  as a result  we do not consider the impact of market risk on foreign currency transactions material 
for that reason  we do not intend to engage in hedging transactions
