item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance standard analog  high speed mixed signal and digital integrated circuits 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the high bandwidth communications  computer  telecommunications and industrial markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for   and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures  the successful development of new products  and the company s ability to ramp up manufacturing capacity to meet demand 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative purchased in process technology total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in due primarily to higher standard product revenues and  to a lesser extent  higher custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such increases resulted from increased unit shipments combined with an increase in average selling prices 
sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  high bandwidth communications products and computer peripheral products 
such products were sold to manufacturers in the high bandwidth communications  telecommunications  and industrial markets 
custom and foundry revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such increases were due primarily to increased sales of custom high bandwidth communications products and to a lesser extent increased foundry sales 
increasing overall end customer demand during the second half of and the first half of resulted in capacity constraints and increasing order lead times for semiconductor suppliers 
longer lead times and concern about availability of semiconductor components  resulted in increased order rates for standard products during the first three quarters of compared to the same periods in  resulting in increased order backlog 
orders from oem customers and contract manufacturers serving the high speed communications market were especially strong in the first nine months of as these customers attempted to secure semiconductor components to meet their projected end demand 
however  the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because customer end demand can change very quickly and  semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
customers continuously adjust their inventories resulting in frequent changes in demand for the company s products 
the volatility of customer demand limits the company s ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
the semiconductor industry experienced such a change in the supply and demand situation during shipments to mobile handset manufacturers declined in the second and third quarters compared to the first quarter as these customers attempted to align inventories with revised demand projections 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued shipments to customers serving the computer market increased in compared to but did not exhibit typical seasonal increases in the second half of compared to the first half of the year 
despite the inventory corrections in the wireless handset and computer end markets  the company s revenues grew sequentially in every quarter of due to the high demand from customers in the high speed communications and industrial markets 
however  in the fourth quarter of  customers in the high speed communications end market  and the contract manufacturing firms that serve this market  began to adjust their inventories to lower demand projections  resulting in cancellations and rescheduling of previously placed orders 
this activity  combined with the overall slowing of economic growth in the north american economy  led to lower order rates in the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in  and a reduction in order backlog from the end of the third quarter 
for the year ended december   net revenues increased to million from million in due to higher standard product revenues and higher custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of high bandwidth communication products  switching regulators  low dropout regulators and computer peripheral devices 
such products were sold to manufacturers of communications  portable computing  computing peripherals and industrial products 
the rapid build out of the internet infrastructure was the primary driver for the increased revenue for standard high bandwidth products 
custom and foundry revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this decline as a percent of total revenues reflects a reduced emphasis on custom and foundry products as compared to the same periods in  in which the company increased its emphasis on custom and foundry products as an interim response to the asian financial crisis 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increase in international sales resulted from increased unit shipments to manufacturers of personal computers and communications products primarily in asia and europe 
the company s international sales are denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations 
the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to domestic  canadian  and certain other international distributors until such distributors resell the company s products to their customers 
sales to stocking representatives and oem customers are recognized upon shipment 
the company estimates returns and warranty costs and provides an allowance as revenue is recognized 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in gross margin reflected higher average selling prices  an increased mix of higher gross margin products and increases in manufacturing efficiency due to greater capacity utilization 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the year ended december   the company s gross margin increased to from for the year ended december  the gross margin improved from the prior year level  which was depressed by the write off  in the fourth quarter of of approximately million in excess inventory in response to a reduced sales forecast of synergy products 
excluding the synergy inventory write off  gross margin for was 
in addition  the improvement in gross margin reflected an increase in manufacturing efficiency due to greater capacity utilization and reductions in contract assembly and test unit costs  which were partially offset by declining average selling prices 
manufacturing yields  which affect gross margin  may from time to time decline because the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
factors such as minute impurities and difficulties in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
there can be no assurance that the company in general will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new processes and the definition  design and development of new products 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses represented and for the years ended december  and on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the dollar increases were primarily due to increased engineering staffing costs and increased prototype material costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects that research and development expenses will increase on a dollar basis in the future 
for each of the years ended december  and  research and development expenses represented of net revenues 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased engineering staffing costs associated with the acquisition of synergy and the development of new standard products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increases were principally attributable to increased commissions and staffing costs associated with the growth of the company s revenues  increased legal costs  and increased profit sharing accruals to promote personnel retention 
for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increase was principally attributable to higher wages and salaries  commissions  advertising and other administrative expenses associated with the growth of the company s revenues 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued purchased in process technology 
on december   the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of altos semiconductor for a cash purchase price of million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the total purchase cost was allocated to intangible assets 
of that amount   was allocated to purchased in process technology  which has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use  for which the company recorded charges in the year ended december  on november   the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of synergy semiconductor for a cash purchase price of million  transaction fees of million  direct merger costs of approximately  and the assumption of liabilities of approximately million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the total purchase cost was allocated to intangible assets 
of that amount  approximately million was allocated to purchased in process technology  which has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use  for which the company recorded charges in the year ended december  the purchased in process technology related to approximately individual development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and  therefore  the successful completion of such projects was uncertain 
those development projects correspond to three existing product lines supercom  clockworks and logic 
other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment grade securities offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
other income  net increased by million to million in from  in this increase were primarily due to an increase in average cash and investment balances combined with increased rate of returns on such balances 
the company expects to continue to utilize term financing as appropriate to finance its capital equipment needs 
for the year ended december   other income  net decreased by  to  from million in such decrease was due to an increase in average long term debt associated with the synergy acquisition 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was of income before taxes 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was of income before taxes excluding the  charge for purchased in process technology  which is a non deductible charge for federal income tax purposes 
the and income tax provisions differ from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes and the non deductible charges for purchased in process technology offset by the benefit from the foreign sales corporation  federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of cash and short term investments of million and bank borrowing arrangements 
borrowing agreements consisted of i million under a revolving line of credit  of which all was unused and available at december   and ii million under a non revolving line of credit  of which million was unused and available at december  the two lines of credit are covered by the same loan and security agreement 
the revolving line of credit portion of the agreement expires on april  subject to automatic renewal on a month to month basis thereafter unless terminated by either party upon days notice 
the non revolving line of credit portion of the agreement expires on management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued april  borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   or the bank s revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor at december  plus 
borrowings under the non revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   the bank s non revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor at december  plus  a fixed rate based on the four year us treasury bill rate at december  plus or an annual adjustable rate based on the one year us treasury bill rate at december  plus 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include a restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends without the lender s consent 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  the non revolving bank line of credit that is covered by the loan agreement described above  can be used to fund purchases of capital equipment whereby the company may borrow up to of the acquisition cost 
amounts borrowed under this credit line are automatically converted to four year installment notes 
all equipment notes are collateralized by substantially all of the company s manufacturing equipment 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under term notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 
the company s working capital increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  accounts receivable of million and deferred income taxes of million  which were partially offset by increases in deferred income of million 
the company s short term investments were principally invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
the company s cash flows provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased net income  income taxes payable and deferred income 
for the year ended december  the company s cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to net income of million after adding back non cash activities  an increase in income taxes payable of million excluding million non cash tax benefits from employee stock transactions and an increase in deferred income of million which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million which increased with higher revenues 
the company s investing activities during the year ended december  used cash of million as compared to million of cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  resulted primarily from net purchases of million of equipment and leasehold improvements that were primarily for wafer fab and testing equipment to increase production capacity  which was partially offset by net sales of short term investments of million 
the company s financing activities during the year ended december  provided cash of million as compared to cash provided of million during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was the result of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options and purchases through the employee stock purchase plan  and proceeds from long term borrowings of million  which was partially offset by million in repayments of long term debt 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company currently intends to reduce its capital equipment purchases from the year levels by to to approximately million to million during the next twelve months primarily for the purchase of additional wafer and test manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company expects that its cash requirements through will be met by its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facilities 
factors that may affect operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future products or product development  statements regarding future research and development spending and the company s product development strategy  statements regarding the levels of international sales  statements regarding future expansion or utilization of manufacturing capacity  statements regarding future expenditures  and statements regarding current or future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the additional factors set forth below 
our operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect our quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult to control or predict are the volume and timing of orders received changes in the mix of products sold market acceptance of our products and our customers products competitive pricing pressures our ability to timely acquire and install capital equipment to expand manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demand availability of production capacity at assembly subcontractors our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors the timing and extent of research and development expenses fluctuations in manufacturing yields cyclical semiconductor industry conditions our ability to hire and retain key technical and management personnel our access to advanced process technologies the timing and extent of process development costs the current california energy crisis management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customer demand for our products is volatile and difficult to predict our customers continuously adjust their inventories resulting in frequent changes in demand for our products 
the volatility of customer demand limits our ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because customer end demand can change very quickly 
also  semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
sales of our products are highly dependent on certain select end markets 
we currently sell a significant portion of our products in the high speed communications  computer and wireless handset markets 
these markets are characterized by short product life cycles  rapidly changing customer demand  evolving and competing industry standards and seasonal demand trends 
additionally  there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow 
if the markets for high speed communications  computers or wireless handsets that we serve fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we currently anticipate  or if we experience increased competition in these markets  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our gross margin is dependent upon a number of factors  among them our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing is a capital intensive business resulting in high fixed costs 
if we are unable to utilize our installed wafer fabrication or test capacity at a high level  the costs associated with these facilities and equipment is not fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower sales margins 
our industry is highly competitive 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  price erosion and increased international competition 
significant competitive factors include product features performance price timing of product introductions emergence of new computer and communications standards quality and customer support because the standard products market for integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  we encounter different competitors in our various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do 
due to the increasing demands for integrated circuits  we expect intensified competition from existing integrated circuit suppliers and the entry of new competition 
increased competition could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in either the standard products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our customers are concentrated  so the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
historically  a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period 
however  we have no long term volume purchase commitments from any of our major customers 
we anticipate that sales of products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
if a significant customer overstocks our products  additional orders for our products could be harmed 
a reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers or the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our order rates  revenues and profits 
there can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater marketing  financial  technical and manufacturing resources than we have 
competition in the markets that we serve is primarily based on the price  performance and quality of products and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion 
product qualification is typically a lengthy process and some prospective customers may be unwilling to invest the time or expense necessary to qualify suppliers like us 
further  customers may also be concerned about relying on a relatively small company for a critical sole sourced component 
to the extent we fail to overcome these challenges  there could be material and adverse effects on our business and financial results 
our product offering is concentrated and a reduction in demand for one of our significant products could reduce our revenues and results of operations 
we currently derive the majority of our product revenues from sales of standard analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and we expect these products to continue to account for the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for standard analog integrated and mixed signal circuits  such as competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
an important part of our strategy is to continue our focus on the market for high speed communications integrated circuits  or ics 
if we are unable to penetrate this market further  our revenues could stop growing and may decline 
our markets frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if our products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  we would likely lose business from existing or potential customers and would not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins until the next product transition 
if we fail to develop products with required features or performance standards  or if we experience even a short delay in bringing a new product to market  or if our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  our revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period of time 
a significant portion of our revenues in recent periods has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from sales of products based on sonet  sdh and atm transmission standards 
if the communications market evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued products that address the needs of our customers or gain substantial market acceptance 
although we have developed products for the gigabit ethernet and fibre channel communications standards  volume sales of these products are modest  and we may not be successful in addressing other market opportunities for products based on these standards 
if we do not successfully expand our manufacturing capacity on time  we may face serious capacity constraints 
we currently manufacture a majority of our integrated circuit products at our wafer fabrication facilities located in san jose and santa clara  california  and we are currently expanding these facilities 
we believe that when the expansion is completed we will be able to satisfy our production needs from these fabrication facilities through fiscal  although this date may vary depending on  among other things  the strength of customer demand for our products 
we will be required to hire  train and manage additional production personnel in order to increase production capacity as scheduled 
in addition  to further expand our capacity to fabricate wafers using various processes  including advanced cmos  we have entered into foundry agreements with third party wafer fabrication providers 
we will have to design our products utilizing the fabrication processes at these foundries  qualify our products and then ramp our production volumes at these foundry fabrication facilities 
if we cannot expand our capacity on a timely basis or successfully utilize our foundry arrangements  we could experience significant capacity constraints that could render us unable to meet customer demand or force us to spend more to meet demand 
in addition  the depreciation and other expenses that we will incur in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity may harm our gross margin in any future fiscal period 
we are exploring alternatives for the further expansion of our manufacturing capacity which would likely occur after  including entering into strategic relationships to obtain additional capacity  building a new wafer fabrication facility  or purchasing a wafer fabrication facility 
any of these alternatives could require a significant investment by us 
there can be no assurance that any of the alternatives for expansion of our manufacturing capacity will be available on a timely basis or that we will be able to manage our growth and effectively integrate our expansion into our current operations 
additionally  the cost of any investment we may have to make to expand our manufacturing capacity is expected to be funded through a combination of available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash from operations and additional debt  and lease or equity financing 
we may not be able to obtain the additional financing necessary to fund the construction and completion of any new manufacturing facility 
expanding our current wafer fabrication facility  building a new wafer fabrication facility or purchasing a wafer fabrication facility also entails significant risks  including shortages of materials and skilled labor unforeseen environmental or engineering problems work stoppages weather interference unanticipated cost increases any one of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the building  equipping and production start up of a new facility or the expansion of our existing facilities 
in addition  unexpected changes or concessions required by local  state or federal regulatory agencies with respect to necessary licenses  land use permits  site approvals and building permits could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled opening of the expansion of our facilities or a new facility and could reduce our anticipated revenues 
also  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the timing of commencement of operation of our expanded facilities or a new facility will depend upon the availability  timely delivery  successful installation and testing of the necessary process equipment 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  our expanded or new facility may not be completed and in volume production within its current budget or within the period currently scheduled 
furthermore  we may be unable to achieve adequate manufacturing yields in our expanded facilities or a new facility in a timely manner  and our revenues may not increase commensurate with the anticipated increase in manufacturing capacity associated with these facilities 
in addition  in the future  we may be required for competitive reasons to make additional capital investments in our existing wafer fabrication facilities or to accelerate the timing of the construction of a new wafer fabrication facility in order to expedite the manufacture of products based on more advanced manufacturing processes 
we encounter risks associated with our international operations 
we have generated a substantial portion of our net revenues from export sales 
we believe that a substantial portion of our future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets  including asia 
international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  and economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
in addition  we sell to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic conditions in asia or elsewhere 
such factors could adversely affect our future revenues  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
historically  we have not experienced significant individual product gross margin differences on export sales compared to domestic sales 
however  as a result of the international market risks discussed above or other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material gross margin fluctuations in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price of our products in the local currencies of the foreign markets we serve 
this would result in making our products relatively more expensive than our competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments 
our operating results substantially depend on manufacturing output and yields  which may not meet expectations 
we manufacture most of our semiconductors at our san jose and santa clara  california fabrication facilities 
manufacturing semiconductors requires manufacturing tools which are unique to each product being produced 
if one of these unique manufacturing tools was damaged or destroyed  then our ability to manufacture the related product would be impaired and our business would suffer until the tool was repaired or replaced 
additionally  the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
small impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the ongoing expansion of the manufacturing capacity of our existing wafer fabrication facilities could increase the risk of contaminants in the facilities 
in addition  many of these problems are difficult to diagnose  and are time consuming and expensive to remedy and can result in lower output and yields and shipment delays 
because the majority of our costs of manufacturing are relatively fixed  output and yield decreases can result in substantially higher unit costs and may result in reduced gross profit and net income 
in addition  output and yield decreases could force us to allocate available product supply among customers  which could potentially harm customer relationships 
our dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that we will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that our cost of materials will be higher than expected 
we face many risks associated with our dependence upon third parties that manufacture  assemble or package certain of our products 
these risks include reduced control over our delivery schedules and quality risks of inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us potential increases in prices potential misappropriation of our intellectual property any of these risks may lead to increased costs or delay delivery of our products  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
we may encounter similar risks if we hire subcontractors to test our products in the future 
additionally  wafer and product requirements typically represent a very small portion of the total production of the third party foundries and outside assembly  testing and packaging contractors 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production on an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce our parts 
we cannot be certain our outside manufacturers will continue to devote resources to the production of our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
each of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design engineers  and we may not be able to continue to attract and train engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product and process development programs 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued because our markets are subject to rapid technological change  our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving and competing industry standards short product life cycles changing customer needs emerging competition frequent new product introductions and enhancements increased integration with other functions rapid product obsolescence to develop new products for the computer and communications markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to develop technical and design expertise 
we must maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet customers changing needs 
we also must respond to changing industry standards  trends towards increased integration and other technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis 
further  if we fail to achieve design wins with our key customers or potential customers our business will face significant harm because once a customer designs a supplier s product into its system  the customer typically is reluctant to change its supply source because of the high costs associated with qualifying a new supplier 
products for communications applications  as well as for computing applications  are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately  or we could be harmed by litigation involving our patents and proprietary rights 
our future success depends in part upon our intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  know how and continuing technology innovation 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued additionally  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we face risks associated with acquisitions we have completed and will face risks associated with any future acquisitions 
we have made three strategic acquisitions in the past two years synergy semiconductor in november  altos semiconductor inc in december and electronic technology corporation in april the risks involved with acquisitions include diversion of management s attention failure to retain key personnel amortization of acquired intangible assets customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations assumption of unknown liabilities any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that any of the companies that we acquired or any business that we may acquire in the future will achieve anticipated revenues and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions accounted for using the pooling of interests methods of accounting are subject to rules established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
these rules are complex and the interpretation of them is subject to change 
additionally  the availability of pooling of interests accounting treatment for a business combination depends in part upon circumstances and events occurring after the acquisition 
the failure of a past business combination or a future potential business combination that has been accounted for under the pooling of interests accounting method to qualify for this accounting treatment would materially harm our reported and future earnings and likely  the price of our common stock 
periods of rapid growth and expansion could continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel and other resources 
to manage expanded operations effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems and to successfully hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
in addition  the integration of past and future potential acquisitions and the expansion of our manufacturing capacity will require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to manage our growth or effectively integrate the expansion of our current wafer fabrication facilities  or a new manufacturing facility  into our current operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our business could be adversely effected by electrical power or natural gas supply interruptions 
the majority or our administrative  technical and manufacturing facilities are located in northern california and these facilities may be subject to electrical power or natural gas supply interruptions 
in recent months  electrical power suppliers have experienced shortages in electrical power which has resulted in brief electrical power interruptions 
the weak financial condition of california s public utilities may aggravate the situation and shortages may develop for natural gas 
semiconductor manufacturing depends upon a controlled environment which requires high usage of electrical power and natural gas 
frequent or extended electrical power interruptions could have a negative impact on production output  manufacturing yields  and manufacturing efficiencies 
the company intends to implement plans to reduce the impact of temporary power outages 
these plans include the installation of emergency electrical power generation equipment 
there can be no assurance that these plans will be successful 
frequent or extended electrical power or natural gas interruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our ability to manufacture sufficient wafers to meet demand could be severely hampered by natural disasters 
our existing wafer fabrication facilities are  and potential new wafer fabrication facilities may be  located in northern california and these facilities may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or a cessation of operations 
in addition  these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities at their present locations or construct or operate a new wafer fabrication facility or could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
our failure to control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company held million in short term investments consisting of corporate debt securities commercial paper with maturities of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on short term investments 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt of approximately million 
a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of this debt 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures
