i part item business overview we are a leader in lab on a chip technologies 
we believe our labchip systems can assemble the power and reduce the size of entire laboratories full of equipment and people 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and automate many laboratory processes  and put them on a chip that can fit in the palm of a child s hand 
each chip contains a network of microscopic channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved  using electricity or pressure  in order to perform experiments 
the chips are the key components of our labchip systems  which also include reagents as well as instruments and software that together control and read the chips 
we believe our labchip systems have the potential to revolutionize experimentation in a wide range of industries by enabling individuals and organizations to perform laboratory experiments at a speed  cost and scale previously unattainable 
our initial commercialization focus is the pharmaceutical industry  where there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of drug discovery and development 
future target industries potentially include agriculture  clinical diagnostics  chemicals and consumer products 
we believe that we are the first company to sell and deliver lab on a chip products to customers 
during we introduced our first two labchip systems  a personal laboratory system and a high throughput system 
in march  we recognized revenue from our first multi capillary sipper chip system  and millennium pharmaceuticals joined our technology access program  becoming our fourth technology access program customer  and our joint applications development program  which was formalized later in the year as our applications developer program 
in may  we introduced the dna labchip kit for the automated sizing and analysis of small dna fragments 
in august  we introduced the protein labchip kit for the automated sizing and analysis of protein samples 
in september  we introduced the automated microfluidics system to perform automated high throughput nucleic acid analysis 
in december  glaxosmithkline became our second applications developer program customer  with the goal of developing new applications in synthetic chemistry using our labchip technology 
our labchip systems we believe that our labchip technology represents a revolutionary advance in laboratory experimentation needed by the pharmaceutical and other industries today 
the chips are the key components of our labchip systems that also include a particular labchip instrument together with experiment specific reagents and software 
our chips contain a network of microscopic channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved to perform experiments 
a single type of chip used with particular reagents and software to perform a particular experiment make up one labchip application 
depending on the chip format  reagents are introduced either automatically or by the user 
the chip is placed in the instrument  which uses software to control the movement of fluids with pressure or electricity 
the instrument also has an optical system for detecting the results 
because we have great flexibility in channel design and can exert split second computer control over fluid flow  we have the ability to create chips for a multitude of experiments 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and automate experiments providing  we believe  the benefits of high speed  reduced cost  expanded individual researcher capability  improved data accuracy and improved enterprise wide productivity 
features of labchip systems miniaturization 
conventional laboratory equipment typically uses about a drop of fluid  or to microliters  to perform each experiment 
in some labchip applications  this volume is reduced to nanoliter  or one billionth of a liter  an improvement of up to  fold over conventional systems 
integration 
integration is the compression of multiple processes into a single process 
today most laboratory systems perform only one or two steps of an experimental protocol 
our labchip systems can integrate complete experiments involving half a dozen or more steps into one continuous process performed on a single chip 
automation 
today most laboratory experiments are performed using multiple instruments in combination with multiple manual steps 
with our labchip systems  entire experiments can be automated and performed inside a chip using one instrument 
the same instrument is used with different chips to perform other automated experiments 
key benefits of labchip systems high speed 
we believe our labchip systems accelerate experiments as much as fold or more  depending on the application 
for example  molecular separations such as electrophoresis normally take one hour or more using conventional equipment 
on a chip  we can perform these separations in less than one minute 
another example is that chemical reactions are usually incubated for minutes or more before the results are determined 
often  these long incubation periods are necessary only to provide enough time for manual steps to be performed on large numbers of samples 
by integrating sample processing and detection  we can perform reactions in one minute or less and achieve comparable results 
we believe our customers can take advantage of this acceleration to increase throughput or to complete experiments faster  depending on their needs 
reduced reagent and labor cost 
our labchip systems use only a small fraction of the normal amount of expensive reagents used in experiments performed in test tubes or well plates  sometimes as little as  th  and also reduce labor involved in each experiment 
we believe that saving on reagent cost and labor can enable pharmaceutical companies to expand the scale of experimentation in ways that would otherwise not be feasible 
expanded individual researcher capability 
because our labchip systems can collapse a multi step  complex experiment into one step  we believe that individual researchers can perform experiments previously outside their areas of expertise 
by comparison  with conventional  non integrated equipment researchers need to acquire the equipment and master the complexities of performing each individual step 
improved data accuracy 
we believe our labchip systems generally produce more accurate and consistent data by reducing human error and the variability caused by the use of multiple instruments 
with higher quality data  our customers can make better decisions 
for example  biochemical determinations typically require accurate liquid measurements and precise incubation times 
when these are manually performed significant variations can occur in liquid dispensing and in the duration of reaction times 
improved enterprise wide productivity 
we believe our labchip systems can improve data quality to the point where researchers can rely on data generated outside their laboratory or organization 
we believe this would improve enterprise wide productivity by supporting data sharing and reducing the need to repeat experiments 
when different research groups use different assortments of conventional equipment to perform experiments  they often produce data that is not strictly comparable 
we believe that our labchip systems have the potential to expand the capabilities and improve the productivity of individual researchers and  on an institutional level  to streamline and bring greater efficiency and speed to the drug discovery and development process 
not all laboratory processes  however  are ideally suited to be performed with our labchip systems 
for example  detecting clinically important materials that appear in low concentrations in a sample  such as the virus that causes aids or some hormones  is not always practical with our labchip systems 
this is because there is a risk that these materials will not be found in the very small volume employed by our chips 
as a result  without pre processing the sample to increase the concentration our labchip system may fail to detect the material 
furthermore  if the analysis of a sample must involve even one process that cannot currently be performed in the labchip system  then use of the labchip system for the parts it can perform is often impractical 
this is because the very small scale of the chip experiment does not generally produce enough material to be analyzed by conventional laboratory equipment 
the faster pharmaceutical companies can identify and validate targets  screen massive numbers of compounds  optimize leads and identify promising compounds to take into clinical development  the greater their chances of seeing a return on investment for their research and development dollars 
labchip technology has the potential to reduce the time it takes to discover and commercialize new drugs 
in the future  we believe we can bring similar benefits to other industries 
products and services we have developed three types of labchip systems  based on distinct chip formats personal laboratory systems  high throughput systems  and application development systems 
our personal laboratory systems use chips with reservoirs for the various chemical reagents  which the user introduces manually 
our high throughput systems use our sipper chip systems that have a short tube  or capillary  that draws nanoliter volumes of reagents into the chip 
our application development system is a microscope based instrument that uses planar chips capable of performing many different analytical experiments  also known as assays  and analyses 
personal laboratory systems product description status agilent bioanalyzer desktop labchip instrument and marketed by agilent software dna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing marketed by agilent large dna fragments dna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing marketed by agilent small dna fragments dna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing marketed by agilent small dna fragments protein labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing marketed by agilent protein samples rna labchip kit chips and reagents for analyzing marketed by agilent rna samples new labchip kits a series of kits containing chips in development and reagents for applications in molecular and cell biology agilent bioanalyzer system 
our first personal laboratory system is based on the agilent bioanalyzer  a desktop instrument designed to perform a wide range of everyday scientific applications using a menu of different labchip kits 
each kit contains a chip and reagents designed specifically for the application 
this labchip system brings the benefits of miniaturized  integrated and automated experimentation to the researcher s desktop 
agilent launched this product in september agilent is selling the agilent bioanalyzer with a menu of three labchip kits for dna sizing and concentration analysis  one for rna sizing and concentration analysis  and one for protein sample sizing and concentration analysis 
for these applications  we believe the system s principal advantages are that it reduces analysis time from hours to minutes integrates several experimentation steps into one significantly reduces consumption of costly reagents produces higher quality data than conventional methods because these applications are among the most common experiments performed in genetic research  the potential customer base for these applications includes most pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as human genome research centers and other academic laboratories 
we are developing additional applications  for example  to analyze cells  as well as additional applications involving dna  rna and protein analysis 
we believe that the protein and cell applications on the agilent bioanalyzer may be particularly attractive to researchers in those disciplines because their existing tools are generally less advanced than those available to genetic researchers 
high throughput systems our high throughput systems are being designed to perform thousands or tens of thousands of pharmaceutical experiments per day on each chip 
the hardware platforms on which these systems run today include the caliper  caliper  and caliper we are also developing new instrument platforms that have the potential to offer customers greater functionality and flexibility for high throughput experimentation 
we believe the principal advantages of caliper s high throughput systems are that they reduce costly reagent consumption up to  fold integrate multiple experimental functions reduce the need for user intervention produce higher data quality than conventional methods caliper system 
we sell assay development equipment  to our technology access program customers for use with the caliper high throughput screening systems 
using the caliper  our customers can modify experimental conditions used with our standard assay chips for each new pharmaceutical target 
this process is comparable to current assay development procedures  which typically take one to three months to complete 
in fact  we believe that the development process will likely be accelerated and improved using chip based systems 
caliper sipper system 
the caliper uses chips with a single capillary 
like the agilent bioanalyzer  the caliper is designed to perform a wide range of experiments using a menu of different chips 
we currently offer four types of chips used for performing drug screening experiments for several classes of enzymes and cell lines 
high throughput enzyme and cell based experiments are among the most common assays used in primary drug screening 
some of the reagents used in these experiments are expensive and it can take months to produce them in the quantities required for conventional screening systems 
we expect to add several more types of chips  enabling our technology access program customers to use the caliper for a significant percentage of the types of experiments they run 
another important advantage of the caliper is that it can be used not only for primary screening but also for lead optimization 
furthermore  the caliper is compact and could be placed in locations outside the centralized screening group  allowing for more efficient drug development efforts 
caliper ultra high throughput system 
we increase throughput by increasing the number of channels and capillaries on each chip 
we have introduced systems with four sippers that run on the caliper and that are designed to perform approximately  experiments per day  per chip 
our throughput goal is to offer systems that can perform more than  experiments per day 
toward that end  we intend to introduce chips with twelve capillaries per chip and to enable customers to effectively utilize multiple instruments by providing integrated plate handling capabilities 
we have delivered a caliper ultra high throughput instrument to our technology access program customers 
we sell our current high throughput systems to technology access program customers and provide training and support 
we also develop initial assays for them and offer some level of customization in order to integrate our systems most effectively into each customer s production processes 
automated microfluidics system system 
the automated microfluidics system  or ams  is designed to meet the needs of microarray and cloning laboratories that analyze hundreds of samples per day 
the initial application will perform dna fragment sizing  separation and quantitation analyses 
the ams was introduced in the third quarter of  and we shipped instruments to customers in the first quarter of through a collaboration with structural genomix  we intend to develop a protein analysis application for the ams we believe this application will be commercially available in the second half of application development systems product description status caliper instrument workstation for creating and using in development microfluidic applications standard chip set planar chips for testing new assays  in development gaining microfluidic proficiency custom chips chips designed specifically to meet in development customer needs the newly created applications developer program  enables customers to develop proficiency in fundamental microfluidics and to develop novel chip based microfluidic applications using our proprietary labchip technology 
customers that participate in the applications developer program purchase instruments  the caliper applications development workstation  chips and caliper know how to develop new microfluidic applications 
we believe that this new initiative will help to create new applications and new markets for our labchip technology 
services we are using our high throughput systems internally to offer screening services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers that prefer to outsource this activity 
under our value added screening collaboration program  we develop labchip assays for targets selected by a customer 
we then screen the targets against the customer s compound library  our own library  or both  and provide the data to the customer 
we believe that our screening services also add substantial value to our product businesses 
we deploy our most advanced high throughput screening systems in our internal screening services operation 
by making intensive use of those systems in this business  we can provide critical feedback to our product development groups 
this accelerates development and enables us to deliver better systems to our technology access program customers 
we also intend to use our screening services capability to demonstrate to potential technology access program customers how our labchip systems can streamline screening operations and enhance productivity 
commercialization we currently are selling our first personal laboratory system  the agilent bioanalyzer system  through our collaboration with agilent 
we are directly selling our high throughput systems for drug screening through our technology access program and we also directly sell the ams we are also providing high throughput screening services through our value added screening collaboration program 
in addition  through our applications developer program  we intend to directly sell instrumentation and custom chip design service that will enable customers to develop their own applications 
three of our technology access program customers  amgen  eli lilly and millennium  and our commercial partner  agilent  each accounted for in excess of of our revenue in the year ended december  agilent alone accounted for of our revenue in this period  and the three technology access program customers collectively accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december  strategic alliance with agilent we have established a broad relationship with agilent to create a line of commercial research products based on our labchip technologies 
this relationship provides us with the scale and expertise of a leading analytical instrumentation company to bring these novel products to market 
when this relationship was established in may  agilent and caliper publicly stated their intention to invest over million collectively to create and commercialize this line of products over the ensuing five years 
in september agilent introduced the agilent bioanalyzer with three different labchip kits  our first labchip products under this agreement 
in may  we introduced the dna labchip kit for the automated analysis of dna fragments to determine their size and concentration 
in august  we introduced the protein labchip kit for the automated sizing and analysis of protein samples 
in this collaboration  caliper primarily focuses on developing core technology and labchip applications 
we also manufacture the chips and supply the chips and reagents to agilent 
if we elect  however  not to manufacture chips for a labchip application or we are unable to meet minimum supply commitments to be mutually established in the future  agilent would have the right to manufacture those chips 
agilent primarily focuses on developing instruments and software  manufacturing instruments  and marketing  selling and supporting complete systems 
agilent has the contractual right to develop the marketing plan under the collaboration  although to date we and agilent have made these decisions in a collaborative manner 
agilent funds our product development efforts under the collaboration  reimburses our costs of supplying chips and reagents  and pays us a share of the gross margin on all components of labchip systems 
the gross margin share varies depending on the type of collaboration product  whether we or agilent manufacture the collaboration product  and whether the collaboration product is sold during the collaboration or after the collaboration has terminated 
these financial arrangements allow us to offset a portion of the substantial risks inherent in introducing novel technologies 
at the same time  they enable us to support a broad product development program and to retain a substantial financial interest in the products we create 
our agreement with agilent is mutually exclusive in the field of lab on a chip technologies for the research products market 
it requires our consent before agilent may offer products exceeding established sample throughput limits  and it requires agilent s consent before we may offer these products outside the collaboration in excess of established volume limitations 
the term of the agilent agreement is eight years  beginning in may after three years  agilent may elect not to meet annual funding requirements  in which case either party may terminate the agreement 
in any event either party may terminate the agreement after five years 
if the agreement terminates after three years  we will continue to offer the collaboration s products through agilent but agilent will have no rights to our technologies for the development of new products 
if either party terminates the agreement after five years  we will grant agilent a non exclusive license to use the lab on a chip technologies that we have developed up to that time in order to develop new products in substantially the same field that applied during the collaboration 
we will also transfer chip manufacturing know how and receive royalties on agilent s sales of systems that employ our patented technologies 
regardless of whether the collaboration terminates after three or five years  both caliper and agilent will have the right to sell collaboration products  with reciprocal supply arrangements 
technology access program our technology access program is initially focused on high throughput systems for drug screening 
in this program  we work directly with pharmaceutical company customers during the product development process to create successive generations of products 
we provide technology access program customers with access to existing technology  a multi year subscription for technology developed during the subscription period  development and support services and access to prototype labchip systems developed during the subscription period 
by working closely with these customers  we focus our technology and product development efforts where we believe they can have maximum impact for the pharmaceutical marketplace 
our technology access program customers have non exclusive access to all of the high throughput screening products we offer during the term of the agreement 
these agreements generally provide for customers to pay an up front license fee and annual subscription fees  and to reimburse us for our costs of providing development and support services 
instruments and chips are generally sold separately on a product by product basis  although some agreements establish prices for critical instruments or estimates of the price we will charge them for sipper chips based on the amount of data they generate 
our technology access program customers can terminate their participation in the program and still have the right to purchase those products that we offered to them during their participation in the program 
we currently have four technology access program customers for our high throughput screening systems millennium pharmaceuticals  eli lilly  amgen and hoffmann la roche 
our agreements with these customers generally contain the terms described above 
key terms unique to each agreement are described below 
millennium pharmaceuticals 
we announced the formation of a broad technology access and application development collaboration with millennium pharmaceuticals in march based on our labchip microfluidic high throughout technology platform 
the collaboration provides for millennium to subscribe to our technology access program as well as for joint investment in and development of novel labchip applications focused on genomics and other areas of mutual interest 
the term is two years with an option to renew in the third year 
millennium  a leading drug discovery and development company  employs large scale genetics  genomics  high throughput screening and informatics in an integrated science and technology platform 
this collaboration has the potential to lead to the development of new labchip applications in genomics and other areas that can be of high value to millennium and  at the same time  enable us to make these applications available to other customers of our high throughput systems 
eli lilly 
we signed a technology access agreement with eli lilly in august the term is three years  although eli lilly may temporarily suspend its technology access program participation and later reinitiate participation  during which time our support and assistance obligations will also be suspended 
under this agreement our obligations include support for assay development for targets  training for eli lilly personnel  and support for custom development projects 
eli lilly may terminate the agreement on any anniversary 
amgen 
we entered into a technology access agreement with amgen in december the term of this agreement is three years  although amgen may terminate the agreement on any anniversary 
hoffmann la roche 
we entered into a technology access agreement with roche in november  which concluded in july this agreement may be extended by mutual consent and discussions are currently underway concerning an extension of the agreement 
this agreement superseded an earlier agreement under which roche funded early development of the high throughput screening technology in exchange for exclusive rights to an ultra high throughput screening system 
under this agreement roche had non exclusive rights similar to other technology access program customers 
we did not receive an up front license fee or annual subscription fee from roche 
value added screening collaboration program in our value added screening collaboration program we offer high throughput screening services using our labchip systems 
this can enable companies that may not choose to participate in our technology access program to take advantage of our high throughput systems 
our first value added screening collaboration agreement was established with neurocrine biosciences in december we receive screening fees based on the amount of data generated  preclinical milestones and royalties on neurocrine products emerging from the collaboration 
this agreement has a three year term  but may be terminated by either party under limited circumstances after the first year 
in august  we announced that sugen  a wholly owned subsidiary of pharmacia corporation and leader in transduction research  became our second screening customer 
using sugen s compound library and target  we completed a screen and identified which of the compounds have potential for development as drug candidates 
automated microfluidics systems we began shipping the ams to customers in the first quarter of we sell proprietary reagents and chips required for operation of the ams directly to customers as well as support services 
assays for high throughput dna analysis are currently available and we intend to introduce additional assays in the second half of applications developer program the applications developer program is the first formal program to implement our strategy of distributed applications development 
the applications developer program is designed to enable customers to establish their own in house microfludics research programs using our labchip technology and developmental tool set 
participation in the applications developer program involves the purchase of instrumentation  training in microfluidics  custom chip design services and a supply of both standard and custom microfluidic chips 
during participation in the applications developer program  customers identify an assay to address their specific needs and we customdesign a chip to perform that assay 
we intend to provide the training and support to customers to help them develop sufficient microfluidic expertise to use the instrumentation and chips efficiently 
we also intend to assist customers who wish to commercialize the resulting custom chip by facilitating the development of instrumentation and supply any necessary chips to fully enable the customer to develop and commercialize entirely new labchip systems 
we and glaxosmithkline announced the formation of a collaboration under our applications developer program to jointly develop new applications in snythetic chemistry using our labchip microfluidic technology 
together  we will focus on exploiting our microfluidic solutions with glaxosmithkline s innovative approach to medicinal chemistry and lead discovery 
the goal of the collaboration is to create novel tools and methods for performing chemical synthesis in a microfluidic chip 
the term of the collaboration is one year  with the ability to renew annually 
we possess the right to commercialize any chip products resulting from the collaboration 
technology we believe that we have established a leading position in three areas of lab on a chip technology 
microfabrication we create lab on a chip devices using the same manufacturing methods that are used to make microchips in the computer industry called microfabrication 
microfabrication makes it possible to create intricate designs of interconnected channels that are extremely small 
each pattern is designed to produce the series of fluid manipulation steps that will execute an experiment 
we use the principles of fluid dynamics  chemical and electrical engineering and biophysics to create initial designs using computer aided design tools 
because we have designed  manufactured and tested hundreds of different chips  we have developed proprietary design rules that make each round of chip creation more predictable and likely to succeed 
we design our chips to be disposable and relatively inexpensive to manufacture 
we place the more expensive electronic controls and sensing capability in a separate instrument 
once a design pattern is completed  we use microchip manufacturing methods to recreate the design as channels in a sheet of quartz  glass or plastic 
this process creates highly precise channels with dimensions that can be varied by width and depth 
a typical channel is roughly microns wide and microns deep  approximately the size of a strand of hair 
in the next step  a second sheet of quartz  glass or plastic with a precise pattern of holes is fused to the first sheet using a proprietary process 
this covers the channels and converts them to closed microfluidic conduits 
the end of each channel connects to an open reservoir through which fluids are introduced 
the sheets are then cut into individual chips  which can be less than one inch to a few inches on a side 
the individual chips are then packaged into plastic holders that make them easier for the user to handle 
we currently make two basic chip formats 
in our planar chips  such as those used in the agilent bioanalyzer  the user introduces all of the chemical reagents into the reservoirs  including the various samples to be tested  using pipettes 
in our sipper chip devices  such as those used in the caliper and caliper  a small tube  or capillary  inserted into the chip draws a few nanoliters of each sample into the channel network 
in this way  minute quantities of a large number of samples can be tested in a single chip 
the samples are introduced into the capillary one after the other  spaced by buffer solution 
they proceed through the channel network in a continuous flow  assembly line fashion to perform a complete experiment 
we have an issued us patent claiming this assay technique 
microfluidics in our labchip systems the movement of minute quantities of fluids  or microfluidics  is actively controlled by computer programs 
we use two different methods of generating fluid motion in microchannels electrokinetics and pressure 
electrokinetic flow is generated when electrodes attached to computer driven power supplies are placed in the reservoirs at each end of a channel and activated to generate electrical current through the channel 
under these conditions  fluids of the appropriate type will move by a process known as electro osmosis 
typical flow rates within the channel are about a millimeter per second and the flow rate can be controlled with a high degree of precision 
programs can then be written to generate highly specific and complex networks of flow 
one key to designing complex systems is controlling and directing the flow at intersections 
fundamental techniques for accomplishing this were invented by dr 
j 
michael ramsey  one of our co founders and a scientific advisor  and are covered by a series of issued and pending us patent applications 
we hold an exclusive license to these patents for most applications and a non exclusive license for remaining applications 
another electrokinetic phenomenon known as electrophoresis occurs in the channels 
this is the movement of charged molecules or particles in an electric field 
electrophoresis is often used in conventional laboratories for analyzing molecules since they move differently according to their physical make up 
electrophoresis can be used to move molecules in solution  or to separate molecules with very subtle differences 
electrophoresis and electro osmosis generally occur at the same time in channels 
however  we have developed proprietary techniques for minimizing either force while maintaining the other  as appropriate  for a given application 
pressure can also be used to move fluid in the channels 
on the microfluidic scale  small amounts of pressure produce highly predictable and reproducible fluid flow 
we use both computer controlled pressure and electrokinetic forces to gain precise control over fluid flow in the microfluidic channel network 
it is possible to use electrokinetic forces alone  pressure forces alone  or a combination of the two methods 
lab on a chip applications development we have developed a large amount of expertise at discovering new functions that microfluidic chips can perform 
we have generated proprietary computer models of how an experiment can be carried out 
we store these functional designs and we can incorporate them into new designs that simulate complete experiment pathways 
in this way  we believe the value of new microfluidic inventions can be rapidly expanded across many application development projects 
we have also developed expertise at making experiments work in our chips 
currently  all of our systems use fluorescent chemical reagents and optical detection instruments to read experimental results 
we often need to explore chemical strategies for labeling relevant reagents that can reveal how different molecular interactions take place 
another area of investigation addresses the fact that in these small dimensions  the amount of channel surface material relative to the amount of liquid is many times higher than in a test tube or microwell plate 
because of this  the surface material can exert a chemical influence on the biochemical reactions taking place 
we have created strategies to avoid the problems this can cause  or benefit from it if possible 
we have developed sipper chips that perform and analyze enzyme reactions using part of the channel design as a tiny  continuously operating electrophoresis machine 
thus  reactions with one sample are going on in one area of the chip while electrophoretic separation of the products of another sample is taking place in a different part of the chip 
we have also found that  in many cases  fluorescence polarization spectroscopy  an optical detection method that can determine the proportion of a fluorescent molecule that is attached to a larger molecule or is unbound in solution  can be used to read reaction results without needing to electrophoretically separate the biochemicals 
we have built this optical detection capability into our high throughput systems 
in general  our experience is that microfabrication and microfluidics provide a rich tool set with which to create innovative new applications 
research and development we have made substantial investments in lab on a chip research and product development since our inception 
we explored fundamental issues of lab on a chip technology as early as possible in order to find solutions to important technical challenges and seek patent protection for our solutions 
today we are supplementing these core technology research efforts with applied product development efforts in several areas 
technology research our technology research activities fall into several classes 
chemical engineering 
we are increasing our understanding of the design rules guiding the development of new chips 
using the principles of chemical engineering we create patterns of interconnected channels that permit execution of the various common steps of experimentation 
designs from one chip can be used for other chips needing similar fluidic functions for a different application 
mathematics and computer models also help minimize the number of iterations necessary to achieve new functional chip designs 
chip manufacturing 
we continue to seek ways to improve the yield and decrease the cost of manufacturing our chips 
we are exploring novel fabrication techniques and the use of new materials that offer functional advantages  such as manufacturing in quartz to take advantage of its superior optical features 
we have development programs in manufacturing technology for chips made of plastic 
plastic devices potentially offer cost advantages and can offer favorable surface chemical features for some applications 
a major area of development is micromachining technology for precisely attaching capillaries to our sipper chips to access reagents 
in high throughput experimentation  the number of capillaries and channels determines the level of throughput 
accordingly we are developing high yield fabrication methods to enable us to cost effectively manufacture chips with many capillaries to perform ultra high throughput experimentation 
engineering and software 
we use the skills of electrical engineers  optical engineers  mechanical engineers  product designers and software engineers to create new instrumentation to run our chips 
these instruments control fluid movement inside the chip  present the reagents to the chip from conventional fluid sources  and detect the results of biochemical or cell based experiments with optical methods 
software engineers write computer programs that control the sources of fluid motion  communicate between different instrument components and interpret signals from the detection system 
currently we develop the software for our high throughput systems 
we collaborate with agilent to develop software for our personal laboratory systems 
product development our product development efforts are currently focused on new applications and capabilities for our existing instruments  our librarycard system  and high throughput genomic systems 
extensions of existing product lines 
for each of our first generation instruments  we are expanding the menu of applications to address other stages of the pharmaceutical development process 
for the agilent bioanalyzer  we intend to introduce new applications that address everyday productivity needs in many areas of genomics  protein chemistry and cell biology 
we are broadening the application menu for high throughput systems as well to include assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
librarycard system 
we are developing a new format for storing and accessing reagents  which we call the librarycard reagent array 
we have learned how to reconstitute very small quantities of dried reagents stored at high density on a planar surface 
we can conveniently access reagents stored in this way using our sipper chips 
the librarycard reagent array could produce a fundamental change in the way large libraries of reagents are used 
today  these libraries are only accessible in centralized reference style laboratories that are set up to work with automated warehouses of reagents 
when libraries can be reduced to the size of a postcard  high throughput experimentation involving massive data acquisition can be decentralized 
we believe that this will increase the size of the market for applications that run on this type of system 
we believe this type of system could significantly impact several stages of the pharmaceutical development process  particularly primary screening and pharmacogenetic studies 
we made progress in key areas of development of the librarycard system in and our goal is to have a prototype system available in late snp genotyping 
genotyping is the determination of the dna sequence variation present at a particular site in an individual s dna 
one type of these variations  called single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps  are believed to be important determinants of disease 
like all experimentation processes  these applications are a combination of various fluid manipulations  biochemical reactions  molecular separations and detection 
we believe the processes required for snp analysis can be performed on the same basic high throughput platform we have built for other applications 
we are developing an integrated snp genotyping application that is designed to perform the steps of reagent assembly  amplification and genotyping in rapid  serial fashion inside the channels of a microfluidic chip 
we believe that our snp genotyping systems will offer the advantages of nanoliter scale processing of valuable reagents  automated reagent assembly and computer controlled heating and mixing for high quality data production 
in  we made progress in developing our snp genotyping application by demonstrating serial amplification of nanoliter size fluid plugs 
our goal is to have a prototype system available in late this program had its origins in a project funded in part by the advanced technology program of the national institute of standards and technology  to adapt the platform and develop chips to run high throughput nucleic acids analyses 
our research and development expenses for the years ended   and were approximately  million  and million  respectively 
we expect research and development spending to continue to increase in proportion to our revenue growth over the next several years as we expand our research and product development efforts 
as of december   we had employees engaged in research and development  including with advanced degrees 
manufacturing we manufacture our chips in house and are currently manufacturing high throughput instruments in limited volumes 
in the fourth quarter of year  we received a recommendation from underwriters laboratories for iso certification for the manufacture of our chips and reagents 
iso  the international standards organization  sets international standards for quality in product manufacturing and production 
we rely upon agilent to manufacture the agilent bioanalyzer 
our high throughput instruments are generally integrated with plate stacking and handling units offered commercially by other companies 
we contract with third parties to supply most reagents for the research products business 
we currently depend on suppliers to supply prepared materials for use in the manufacture of chips 
we intend to continue and may extend the subcontracting of portions of our manufacturing processes to subcontractors where we feel it best leverages the supplier s manufacturing experience  costs  and or improves our ability to meet customer demands 
for a discussion of the methods we use to manufacture our chips see technology and research and development 
competition although we believe that we are currently the only company selling and delivering lab on a chip products to customers  we expect to encounter intense competition from a number of companies that offer products for laboratory experimentation 
we anticipate that our competitors will come primarily from the following two sectors companies providing conventional products based on established technologies companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies in order to compete against vendors of conventional products  we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our labchip products over alternative well established technologies and products 
we will also need to demonstrate the potential economic value of our labchip products relative to these conventional technologies and products 
some of the companies that provide these products include the applied biosystems division of applera formerly pe corporation  agilent  beckman coulter  amersham pharmacia biotech  bio rad laboratories  and molecular devices 
we will also need to compete effectively with companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies and products  such as aclara biosciences and orchid biosciences 
other companies known to have initiated microfluidic programs include motorola  m  applera  amersham pharmacia biotech and cepheid 
microfluidic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in these and future technologies which we may not be able to do 
rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete 
products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies 
in addition  there is the possibility that we may experience competition from agilent if they  or we  terminate our agreement after may under the terms of our agreement  upon termination we will grant to agilent a non exclusive license to our labchip technologies as then developed for use in the research products field 
in many instances  our competitors have or will have substantially greater financial  technical  research  and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution  and service organizations than we do 
moreover  competitors may have greater name recognition than we do  and may offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products  or that would render our technologies and products obsolete 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies 
intellectual property we seek patent protection on our lab on a chip technologies 
as of march   we owned or held licenses to issued us patents and pending us patent applications  some of which derive from a common parent application 
the issued us patents expire between and foreign counterparts of many of these patents and applications have been filed and or issued in one or more other countries  resulting in a total of more than issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and foreign countries 
these patents and applications are directed to various technological areas which we believe are valuable to our business  including control of movement of fluid and other material through interconnected microchannels continuous flow high throughput screening assay methods and systems analytical and control instrumentation analytical system architecture chip based assay chemistries and methods chip compatible sample accession software for control of microfluidic based systems and data analysis chip manufacturing processes we also rely upon copyright protection  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our lab on a chip technology 
we are party to various exclusive and non exclusive license agreements with third parties which give us rights to use certain technologies 
for example  we have an exclusive license in the fields we are currently operating in from lockheed martin energy research corporation  relating to patents covering inventions by dr 
j 
michael ramsey 
a failure to maintain some or all of the rights to these technologies could seriously harm our business 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees  including in research and development  in manufacturing and in administration and finance 
none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced any work stoppage 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

item properties our principal research and development  manufacturing and administrative facilities are currently located in approximately  square feet of leased space in mountain view  california 
the lease for this space will expire in we believe that our current facilities are adequate for our needs through the first quarter of  and we are currently assessing the need for additional facilities to meet our future needs 
if we are unable to locate additional facilities  we will be required to delay our planned expansion 
any facilities that we are able to locate and lease may be on terms that are expensive to us  especially since we are located in the silicon valley in california where such facilities are in short supply and lease rates are high 
item legal proceedings on march   we filed a lawsuit in california superior court for the county of santa clara case no 
cv  against aclara biosciences inc  a patent attorney named bertram rowland and the law firm of flehr  hohbach  test  albritton and herbert llp  alleging that all three defendants misappropriated our trade secrets relating to our business plans  patents and intellectual property strategy 
the suit also alleges that dr 
rowland and flehr hohbach committed a breach of the duties they owed to us as our former attorneys 
the suit seeks damages and equitable remedies to prevent aclara  dr 
rowland and flehr hohbach from benefiting from the alleged misappropriation and breach of duties 
on september   we reached a settlement agreement with dr 
rowland and flehr hohbach in the case pending in santa clara county 
the settlement provided caliper with a million cash payment by dr 
rowland and flehr hohbach  as well as other terms 
this settlement has no effect on caliper s lawsuits with aclara 
in this same case  on october   the jury returned a verdict in favor of caliper and against aclara on caliper s claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and conversion of property 
the jury awarded caliper million for damages to caliper and unjust enrichment to aclara  which the court reduced to million 
on january   we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of california against aclara case no 
c crb jcs alleging that aclara is infringing four us patents that have been licensed to us by lockheed martin energy research corporation  which operates the department of energy s oak ridge national laboratory where the inventions were made 
these patents cover technology for controlling the flow of materials in microfluidic chips  as well as devices  systems and applications that make use of this technology 
we subsequently amended this complaint to add a fifth  related patent 
aclara counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the patents in this suit are invalid  unenforceable and are not infringed by aclara 
on april   aclara biosciences filed a lawsuit in united states district court for the northern district of california case no 
c bz alleging that we are making  using  selling or offering for sale microfluidic devices that infringe united states patent number  in willful disregard of aclara s patent rights 
this patent concerns methods and devices for moving molecules by the application of electrical fields 
the aclara action seeks damages for past and future reduced sales or lost profits based upon our alleged fabrication  use  sale or offer for sale of allegedly infringing products and processes  and seeks to enjoin our continued activities relating to these products 
we counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement  invalidity and unenforceability of all claims of the aclara patent 
on july   the federal judge in this action issued an order finding that eight of the eleven claims asserted against us are invalid  and interpreting the remaining asserted claims 
on october   the federal judge issued a second order holding that our products do not literally infringe aclara s patent  but allowing the suit to proceed on the issue of whether our products infringe under a legal theory known as the doctrine of equivalents and whether the patent is valid and enforceable 
on january   we announced that we had reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with aclara biosciences on all pending litigation between the two companies 
under the terms of the settlement both companies agreed to dismiss all suits and countersuits in the federal and state court actions and to cross license selected patents 
the settlement provides us with freedom to operate under aclara s family of patents  which includes the and other patents  for our glass chips and related instruments through a fully paid  royalty free license 
under the terms of the agreement  aclara will also pay us million over the next three years in a combination of stock  cash  and committed minimum royalties 
we have agreed to license to aclara the ramsey family of patents for use with aclara s polymer chips and related instruments in exchange for license fees and royalties 
the two companies have also agreed to an alternative dispute resolution procedure for handling potential future patent disagreements out of court

overview we are a leader in lab on a chip technologies that miniaturize  integrate and automate many laboratory processes 
we develop  manufacture and sell our proprietary labchip systems to pharmaceutical and other companies 
we believe our labchip systems have the potential to assemble the power and reduce the scale of entire laboratories full of equipment and people 
from inception in july through september  our operating activities were primarily devoted to research  development and commercialization of technologies involving the manipulation of very small amounts of fluid  which are referred to as microfluidic technologies  and first generation products such as the agilent bioanalyzer  labchip kits and our high throughput systems  recruiting personnel  business development  raising capital and acquiring assets 
in  we recognized revenue from our first product sales when we sold initial versions of our high throughput system for drug screening to three of our technology access program customers amgen  eli lilly and roche 
in addition  in september  agilent technologies  inc  our commercial partner  introduced our first labchip system for use by individual researchers 
in march  we recognized revenue from our first multi capillary sipper chip system and millennium pharmaceuticals joined our technology access program  becoming our fourth technology access program customer  and also joined our joint applications development program  which was formalized later in the year as our applications developer program 
in may  we introduced the dna labchip kit for the automated analysis of small dna fragments to determine their size and concentration 
in august  we introduced the protein labchip kit for the automated sizing and analysis of protein samples 
in september  we introduced the automated microfluidics system to perform automated high throughput nucleic acid analysis in december  glaxosmithkline became our second applications developer program customer  with the goal of developing new applications in synthetic chemistry using our labchip technology 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing scale up  and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development  manufacturing scale up  and general and administrative costs 
as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve profitability 
our revenue has been derived principally from contract revenue earned under our collaboration agreement with agilent and from our technology access program customers 
to a lesser extent  we have derived revenue from the sale of products and government grants 
although we are developing and plan to introduce future products  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of sources 
three of our technology access program customers  amgen  eli lilly and millennium  and our commercial partner  agilent  each accounted for in excess of of our revenue in the year ended december  agilent alone accounted for of our revenue in this period  and the three technology access program customers collectively accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december  agilent alone accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december  and our two technology access program customers  amgen and eli lilly  collectively accounted for of our revenue in this period 
roche and agilent each accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december   and amgen accounted for of our revenue in this period 
although we are seeking to expand our customer base  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful 
under our agreement  agilent funds our research and development expenditures related to the collaboration  reimburses us for our costs of supplying chips and reagents to agilent and pays us a share of the gross margin earned on all components of labchip systems they sell 
revenue from development and support activities under our collaboration agreement is recorded in the period in which the costs are incurred 
direct costs associated with this contract are reported as research and development expense 
revenue related to the reimbursement of costs for the supply of chips and reagents to agilent is recognized upon shipment 
our share of gross margin on components of the labchip system sold by agilent is recognized as revenue upon shipment to the end user 
agilent only began in late the marketing and sales efforts for the agilent bioanalyzer 
sales of new and innovative instrumentation such as the agilent bioanalyzer involve a long sales cycle  requiring customer training and demonstration periods 
sales of the agilent bioanalyzer increased during the course of indicating  we believe  a growing market acceptance of this technology 
under our technology access program agreements  we recognize as revenue non refundable license fees over the contract period  product sales upon the transfer of title to the customer  and development and support fees in the period in which the costs are incurred 
subscription fees and development and support fees may be received annually or quarterly in advance depending upon the terms of the agreement 
payments received in advance under all of these agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
we have evaluated the applicability of sab to our existing technology access program agreements 
we have concluded that the approach described in sab is preferable and have changed our method of accounting effective january  to recognize such fees over the term of the related agreement 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle is approximately million as of january  and has been recognized as a charge in the quarter ended march  the cumulative effect was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the remaining contractual terms of the technology access program agreements 
as of december   a total of million of revenue was deferred 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue through the third quarter of year results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in of the million increase  million was derived from our collaboration with agilent  which began in may with regard to our collaboration with agilent  the increase in revenue was primarily attributed to product revenue resulting from increased volume and product offerings 
the remaining increase was derived from our technology access program customers  primarily from the addition of a new partner and the application of sab  which contributed million to revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for chip development  material costs for prototype and test units  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and litigation  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to continued growth of research and development activities  including million related to increased personnel and services to support our technology access program  partner collaboration and initial product launches  million for costs related to intellectual property matters  primarily legal fees  million for supplies required to assemble  build and test prototype labchip systems and the remainder due to expansion in operating activities 
we expect research and development spending to continue to increase in proportion to our revenue growth over the next several years as we expand our research and product development efforts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  profes sional fees  and other corporate expenses including business development and general legal activities 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was due primarily to million related to employment costs for general and administrative personnel   for general legal fees as a result of being a public company and  for travel expenses to expand our business initiatives 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase over the next several years to support our growing business activities  the commercialization of our products  and costs associated with operating as a public company 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of options at the date of grant 
during and  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million 
this amount is being amortized over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million for and million for we expect to record future amortization expense for deferred compensation as follows million during  million during   during and  during the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if unvested options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently canceled 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income consists of income from our cash and investments offset by expenses related to our financing obligations 
net interest income increased to million in from net interest income of million in this increase primarily resulted from proceeds of million raised in august from the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement 
litigation settlement and reimbursement 
litigation settlement and reimbursement increased to million in as a result of a settlement agreement with a former patent attorney and his former law firm 
of the million  million was a settlement with bertram rowland and the law firm of flehr  hohbach  test  albritton and herbert llp in a breach of fiduciary duty and trade secret misappropriation case 
the remainder relates to reimbursement of litigation fees and expenses from one of our collaborators 
income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million 
we also had federal and california research and other development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning on through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be substantially limited due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  research credit carryforwards  and capitalized research and development costs 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in of the million increase  million was derived from our collaboration with agilent  which began in may  and  was derived from our grant from the advanced technology program of the national institute of standards and technology  which began in january this grant is for million in aggregate and will continue until december the remaining increase was derived from our technology access program customers 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for chip development  material costs for prototype and test units  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and litigation  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was attributable to continued growth of research and development activities  including million related to increased personnel and services to support our technology access program and initial product launches  million for costs related to intellectual property protection  million related to higher operating expenses as a result of our move to a larger facility in january  million for supplies required to assemble  build and test prototype labchip systems and the remainder due to expansion in operating activities 
we expect research and development spending to increase significantly over the next several years as we expand our research and product development efforts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  and other corporate expenses including business development and general legal activities 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during from million in the increase of million was due to million related to compensation for general and administrative personnel   related to higher operating expenses as a result of our move to a larger facility in january  and  related to recruiting and relocation of key personnel 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase over the next several years to support our growing business activities  the commercialization of our products  and due to the costs associated with operating a public company 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income consists of income from our cash and investments offset by expenses related to our financing obligations 
net interest income decreased to million in from net interest income of million in this decrease resulted from higher financing obligation balances 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations from inception primarily through equity sales  contract and milestone payments to us under our collaboration and technology access program agreements  and equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   we had received net proceeds of million from issuances of common and preferred stock which primarily includes million raised in august from the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement and million raised from our initial public offering in december in addition  from inception through december  we had received million from collaborations  technology access program customers and government grants and had financed equipment purchases and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million 
we have used leases and loans to finance capital expenditures 
as of december   we had million in capitalized lease obligations 
these obligations are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of approximately  and are due in monthly installments through december under the terms of one equipment financing agreement  the financed equipment may be purchased by us at a fair value at the end of the financing term 
other equipment financing agreements require a balloon payment at the end of each loan term 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as compared to million as of december  we used million for operations in this consisted of the net loss for the period of million and working capital changes of million offset in part by non cash charges of million related to change in accounting principle  amortization of deferred stock compensation  stock options issued to non employees  stock issued for services and depreciation and amortization expense 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  consisting primarily of purchases of available for sale investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments  as well as capital expenditures 
we received million from financing activities for  which consisted principally of million raised in august from our private placement and million from equipment financing  offset in part by repayments of equipment financing arrangements of million 
see note of notes to our financial statements 
in may  we drew down the remaining  balance of equipment financing credit line which existed as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of and entered into a million financing arrangement for the purchase of property and equipment 
as of december   we had drawn down approximately  under the new line and had million remaining available under this arrangement 
as of december   we had million in capitalized lease obligations outstanding compared to million at december  see note of notes to our financial statements 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to expand our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with the revenue to be derived from our collaboration with agilent and our technology access program agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the year during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented

which deferred the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not anticipated to have an impact on the company s results of operations of financial condition when adopted as the company holds no derivative financial instruments and does not currently engage in hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  a significant amendment of sfas which is effective simultaneously with sfas sfas does not amend any of the fundamental precepts of sfas  but addresses some of the impractical aspects of the original statement  which were incompatible with many common current hedging approaches 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  which  among other things  describes the sec staff s position on the recognition of certain nonrefundable upfront fees received in connection with research collaborations 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for non refundable license fees to recognize such fees ratably over the term of the committed related technology access program agreement 
we believe the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided by sab the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was reported as a charge in the quarter ended march  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the remaining contractual terms of the technology access program agreements 
in march  the fasb issued no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb or fin this interpretation clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions reached in fin cover specific events that occur after either december   or january   but before the effective date of july  the effects of applying fin are recognized on a prospective basis from july  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
factors affecting operating results risks related to our business our labchip systems may not achieve market acceptance  which could cause our revenue to grow slowly or decline 
our technologies are still in the early stages of development  and our labchip systems incorporating these technologies have only recently been made commercially available 
if our labchip systems do not gain market acceptance  we will be unable to generate sales and our revenue will decline 
the commercial success of our labchip systems will depend upon market acceptance of the merits of our labchip systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
we have not yet demonstrated these benefits 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our labchip systems over alternative well established technologies and products the extent of agilent s efforts to market the agilent bioanalyzer our ability to market our high throughput systems through our technology access program because the products comprising our labchip systems have been in operation for a limited period of time  their accuracy  reliability  ease of use and commercial value have not been fully established 
if the initial agilent bioanalyzer customers or our initial technology access program customers do not approve of our initial labchip systems because these systems fail to generate the quantities and quality of data they expect  are too difficult or costly to use  or are otherwise deficient  market acceptance of these labchip systems would suffer and further sales may be limited 
we cannot assure you that these customers efforts to put our labchip systems into use will continue or will be expeditious or effective 
potential customers for our high throughput systems may also wait for indications from our four initial technology access program customers that our high throughput systems work effectively and generate substantial benefits 
further  non acceptance by the market of our initial labchip systems could undermine not only those systems but subsequent labchip systems as well 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next two years  primarily as a result of expected increases in expenses for manufacturing capabilities  research and product development costs and general and administrative costs 
we may not achieve profitability 
for example  we experienced net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
these costs have exceeded our litigation settlement and reimbursement  interest income and revenue which  to date  have been generated principally from collaborative research and development agreements  technology access fees  cash and investment balances and  to a lesser extent  product sales and government grants 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect they will fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
for example  our revenues have varied dramatically as a result of new customers joining our technology access program and product shipments 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly 
because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
if revenue declines in a quarter  whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue or otherwise  our earnings will decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  research and development and general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred stock compensation are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
if agilent determines that we may be violating a third party patent  it may terminate sales of the agilent bioanalyzer  which will decrease our revenue 
under our collaboration agreement with agilent  agilent may elect at any time to stop developing  manufacturing or distributing any product that it reasonably determines  on the advice of counsel  poses a substantial risk of infringing a third party patent 
for example  if a third party claims that we are violating their patent  then agilent may terminate marketing and selling of the agilent bioanalyzer system  which agilent began marketing in september  which will decrease our future revenue 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us  such as the aclara litigation that was recently settled and is described under part i item legal proceedings 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology or potential products 
we have also been notified that third parties have attempted to provoke an interference with one issued us patent that we have exclusively licensed to determine the priority of inventions 
any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline 
we recently settled intellectual property litigation with aclara concerning one family of aclara patents 
however  aclara could assert other patent infringement claims against us in the future in alternative dispute resolution proceedings established under our settlement agreement 
if we are found to be infringing any valid patent claims asserted by aclara in alternative dispute resolution proceedings  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patents to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties  such as the patent infringement suit against aclara that was recently settled and is described under part i item legal proceedings 
these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
they would put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
we may also provoke these third parties to assert claims against us 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  will be commercially valuable 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative  it could cause our stock to decline 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies 
for further information on our intellectual property and the difficulties in protecting it  see part i item business intellectual property 
if we do not successfully introduce new products and expand the range of applications for our labchip systems  we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we intend to develop labchip systems with increasingly high throughput capabilities and develop a broad range of applications for our labchip technology 
if we are unable to do so  our labchip systems may not become widely used and we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
in order for our high throughput systems to achieve the levels of throughput necessary to meet customers demands  we need to develop and manufacture sipper chips with more than four capillaries 
our current high throughput systems operate with sipper chips with one and four capillaries  small glass tubes used to draw compounds into the chip 
in order to achieve the levels of throughput that our customers desire  we may need to develop a labchip system accommodating more than four capillaries  which we may not be able to do 
if we cannot cost effectively deliver chips with more than four capillaries  we may not be able to attract new customers to purchase our high throughput systems  which would seriously harm our future prospects 
further  our existing technology access program customers may decide not to renew their annual access subscriptions  which would seriously reduce our revenue 
we must develop new applications for existing labchip instruments  which we may not be able to do 
the agilent bioanalyzer uses labchip kits that we specifically design for each application 
we currently have labchip kits commercially available for five applications relating to dna  rna and protein sizing and quantification 
dna and rna are commonly used acronyms for chemicals that contain  or transmit  genetic information in living things 
we currently are developing labchip kits for other applications 
if we are unable to develop labchip kits for specific applications required by potential customers  those customers may not purchase the agilent bioanalyzer 
we must also continue to develop applications for our high throughput systems 
if we are not able to complete the development of these applications  or if we experience difficulties or delays  we may lose our current technology access program customers and may not be able to obtain new customers 
we rely heavily on agilent to manufacture  market and distribute the agilent bioanalyzer 
if agilent fails to perform under our agreement or successfully commercialize our collaborative products  our revenue from the agilent bioanalyzer may not be material and we may lose the development funding we currently receive from agilent 
agilent manufactures  markets and distributes the agilent bioanalyzer under an agreement we entered into in may we also rely on agilent for significant financial and technical contributions in the development of products covered by the agreement 
our ability to develop  manufacture and market these products successfully depends significantly on agilent s performance under this agreement 
sales of new and innovative instrumentation such as the agilent bioanalyzer involve a long sales cycle  requiring customer training and demonstration periods 
although sales of the agilent bioanalyzer increased in  we cannot predict whether this trend will continue at its current pace  if at all 
if agilent experiences manufacturing or distribution difficulties  does not actively market the agilent bioanalyzer  or does not otherwise perform under this agreement  our revenue from the agilent bioanalyzer may not be material 
in addition  agilent may terminate the agreement at their discretion at any time after may if agilent terminates this agreement  we would need to obtain development funding from other sources  and we may be required to find one or more other collaborators for the development and commercialization of our products 
our inability to enter into agreements with commercialization partners or develop our own marketing  sales  and distribution capabilities would increase costs and impede the commercialization of our products 
agilent may compete with us if our collaboration terminates after may  which could reduce the potential revenue from our independent product sales 
under the terms of our agreement with agilent  if they  or we  terminate our agreement after may  we will grant to agilent a non exclusive license to our labchip technologies as then developed for use in the research products field 
consequently  there is the possibility that we may experience competition from agilent after may  which would reduce our ability to sell products independently or through other commercial partners 
see part i item business commercialization strategic alliance with agilent for a further description of the terms of our collaboration with agilent 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter manufacturing problems or delays  which could result in lost revenue 
although agilent manufactures the agilent bioanalyzer  we manufacture the chips used in this instrument and also currently manufacture instruments and sipper chips for our high throughput systems 
we currently have limited manufacturing capacity for our labchip system products and experience variability in manufacturing yields for chips 
if we fail to deliver chips and high throughput screening products in a timely manner  our relationships with our customers could be seriously harmed  and revenue would decline 
we currently have one manufacturing location in mountain view  california 
the actual number of chips we are able to sell or use depends in part upon the manufacturing yields for these chips 
we have only recently begun to manufacture significant numbers of sipper chips and are continuing to develop our manufacturing procedures for these chips 
in order to offer sipper chips with more than four capillaries for high throughput applications  we will need to continue to achieve consistently high yields in this process 
we cannot assure you that manufacturing or quality problems will not arise as we attempt to scale up our production of chips or that we can scale up manufacturing in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable costs 
if we are unable to consistently manufacture sipper chips or chips for the agilent bioanalyzer on a timely basis because of these or other factors  our product sales will decline 
we are currently manufacturing high throughput instruments in house and in limited volumes 
if demand for our high throughput instruments increases  we will either need to expand our in house manufacturing capabilities or outsource to agilent or other manufacturers 
we are dependent on a sole source supplier for our glass and if we are unable to buy this component on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our products to customers 
we currently purchase a key component for our chips from a sole source supplier located in germany 
although we keep surplus inventory in our mountain view manufacturing facility  if we are unable to replenish this component on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our chips to our customers which would harm our business 
our business operations may be adversely affected by the california energy crisis 
our principal facilities are located in the silicon valley in northern california 
california has been experiencing an energy crisis that has resulted in disruptions in power supply and increases in utility costs to consumers and business throughout the state 
should the energy crisis continue  together with many other silicon valley companies  we may experience power interruptions and shortages and be subject to significantly higher costs of energy 
although  we have not experienced any material disruption to our business to date  if the energy crisis continues and power interruptions or shortages occur in the future  they may adversely affect our business 
any material increase in energy costs may also adversely affect our financial results 
if a natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenue 
we rely on a single manufacturing location to produce our chips and high throughput systems  and have no alternative facilities 
the facility and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time 
our manufacturing facility may be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods 
earthquakes are of particular significance since the manufacturing facility is located in mountain view  california  an earthquake prone area 
in the event our existing manufacturing facility or equipment is affected by man made or natural disasters  we would be unable to manufacture products for sale  meet customer demands or sales projections 
if our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased  it would harm our business 
because a small number of customers and agilent have accounted for  and are likely to continue to account for  a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline due to the loss of one of these customers or the termination of our agreement with agilent 
historically we have had very few customers and one commercial partner  agilent  from which we have derived the majority of our revenue and  if we were to lose any one of these  our revenue would decrease substantially 
agilent and three customers accounted for of total revenue ended december  agilent and four customers accounted for of total revenue in  and agilent and two customers accounted for of total revenue in we and agilent introduced the agilent bioanalyzer system in september and have not yet derived significant revenue from the sale of this product on a commercial scale 
although we anticipate that future sales of the agilent bioanalyzer system will further expand our revenue base  we expect that we will continue to rely on our large customers and on agilent for the majority of our revenue 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations at least into the year however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with million unused and available as of december  to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
we depend on our key personnel  the loss of whom would impair our ability to compete 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of services of any of these persons could seriously harm our product development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  research  product development and commercialization will require additional skilled personnel in areas such as chemistry and biology  software engineering and electronic engineering 
our business is located in silicon valley  california  where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high 
as a result  competition for and retention of personnel  particularly for employees with technical expertise  is intense and the turnover rate for these people is high 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
the inability to retain and hire qualified personnel could also hinder the planned expansion of our business 
potential acquisitions may have unexpected consequences or impose additional costs on us 
our business is dependent upon growth in the market for microfluidic products and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
from time to time  we may consider and evaluate potential acquisitions or business combinations  which may include a possible merger or consolidation of our business with another entity 
we may engage in discussions relating to these types of transactions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business accounting consequences  including charges for in process research and development expenses  resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the assumption of unforeseen liabilities of the acquired company we cannot assure you that future acquisitions or business combinations in which we are involved  if any  will be successful and will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results 
risks related to owning our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile  and you could lose a substantial portion of your investment 
our stock has been trading on the nasdaq national market only since mid december we initially offered our common stock to the public at per share 
since then our stock price has been extremely volatile and has ranged  through march   from a high of approximately per share to a low of per share 
our stock price may drop substantially following an investment in our common stock 
we expect that our stock price will remain volatile as a result of a number of factors  including announcements by analysts regarding their assessment of caliper and its prospects announcements of our financial results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations general market volatility for technology stocks concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
as of december   our directors  entities affiliated with our directors  our executive officers and principal stockholders beneficially own  in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders as a group are able to substantially influence the management and affairs of caliper and  if acting together  would be able to influence most matters requiring the approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors  any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporate transaction 
the concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change of control of caliper at a premium price if these stockholders oppose it 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition  merger in which we are not the surviving company or changes in our management 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination including us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
declines of interest rates over time will reduce our interest income from our investments 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the table below presents our investment portfolio by expected maturity and related weighted average interest rates at december  fair total value money market fund    average interest rate available for sale marketable securities      average interest rate total securities      average interest rate our equipment financings  amounting to million as of december   are all at fixed rates and therefore  have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all sales to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
