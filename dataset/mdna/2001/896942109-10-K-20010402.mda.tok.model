item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
background tripath imaging develops  manufactures  and markets proprietary products for cancer cell diagnosis  cytology and histopathology 
the company holds in excess of patents that  cumulatively  form a body of intellectual property that spans the entire breadth of image analysis and display in cytology and histopathology 
tripath imaging manufactures and sells products developed from its proprietary technologies and intellectual property 
these include fda approved products designed to automate the screening for cancer of the uterine cervix  including the prep system and the autopap system 
in addition  the company has developed the extended slide wizard line of products  whose modules include an fda approved method for automating measurement of antinuclear antibodies as well as research applications in histopathology  link  a telepathology system  and the autocyte image management and archiving system or aims  a software based image storage and retrieval system for microscopic images 
tripath imaging was created to leverage the complementary nature of the products  technologies  and intellectual property developed by its predecessor companies  all of whom were early pioneers in the application of computerized image processing and analysis to detect the often subtle cellular abnormalities associated with cancer and its precursors 
the company believes that its intellectual property provides a strong foundation for the development and defense of imaging products 
the company also believes that recent advances in genomics  biology  and informatics are providing new opportunities to leverage tripath imaging s proprietary technology 
to date  the company has leveraged its technology assets through the development of an integrated solution for cervical cancer screening and other products for the histopathology laboratory 
tripath imaging generates prep revenue from either the sale or rental of prep systems and from the sale of the related test kits  comprised of proprietary reagents and other disposables 
additionally  the company generates revenue from service contracts on the prep systems 
for system sales  customers purchase the prep instrument and make separate purchases of test kits 
for system rentals  customers pay a fixed monthly fee for the equipment and make separate purchases of test kits 
the company also offers an integrated purchase option  or ipo  program where prep systems are placed at the customer s site free of charge  and the customer pays a higher per test price for the reagents and disposables 
under this program  the company records revenue for the instrument sale which is actually sold to a third party financial institution 
the company has entered into an agreement with a financial institution to support the placement of prep ipo systems 
the financial institution is repaid with part of the proceeds of the reagents and disposables sold 
each prep system placed typically provides a recurring revenue stream as customers process the test kits sold by the company 
tripath imaging currently generates autopap related revenue from the direct sale of autopap systems and from placing autopap systems under fee per use contracts 
in the latter cases  fee per use revenue commences in the month a system is initially placed in commercial use at a customer site and consists of per slide monthly billings  fixed rental billings  or certain fee per use contracts that require minimum payments 
domestic customers may also elect to purchase the autopap instrument under the ipo program 
recently  the company has also converted fee per use contracts to direct sale arrangements resulting in an increase in current period revenue and a corresponding decrease in recurring revenue in future periods 
additionally  the company generates revenue from service contracts on autopap systems 
successful commercialization of prep and autopap for cervical cancer screening in the united states and some other countries will depend on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors 
third party payors may limit the price tripath imaging can charge for the prep and autopap systems or reduce the demand for its products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they provide  or by not providing any reimbursement at all 
the company does not believe the national limits for reimbursement of cervical cancer screening using prep or autopap recently established by hcfa  the organization which administers medicare  will adversely impact the company s current pricing strategy or reduce the demand for its products 
tripath imaging generates revenue from either the sale  or rental  of its extended slide wizard line of products 
additionally  the company generates revenue from service contracts on these products 
for system sales  customers purchase the products through distributors in countries where such relationships exist 
where distributor arrangements do not exist  the company sells these products directly to the customer 
tripath imaging markets its products to domestic and foreign clinical laboratories through direct sales activities in the united states and primarily through distributors in international markets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company significantly expanded its marketing and sales activities to accelerate the commercialization of its core business in several ways 
additional laboratory sales representatives were hired to increase contact potential for the laboratory customer marketplace 
through an alliance with nps  the company engaged the physician market directly for the first time by adding physician directed representatives  on a contract basis  to augment tripath imaging s direct sales efforts 
to further educate and reinforce the benefits of tripath imaging products  a long term partnership with a third party physician peer selling organization was initiated and will carry through into tripath imaging believes that its proprietary technology and intellectual property will provide a unique platform for an array of applications in cell pathology 
the company believes that combining autopap and prep will create a unique and integrated system that is otherwise currently not available from any other single vendor 
in october of  the company announced the initial submission of a supplement to the fda for the screening of prep slides using the autopap 
in december  the company announced the submission of new clinical data to the fda to support applications to expand the claims for the autopap and prep to include the screening of prep thin layer preparations on the autopap 
as a result of ongoing discussions with the fda regarding the company s submissions  the company believes that it will have various options in connection with the pending premarket approval application supplement regarding use of the autopap system to screen prep thin layer slides 
among these are to accept limitations in the company s proposed product labeling or to collect additional data to support the current labeling proposal 
the company is evaluating its options and considering the best course of action 
if fda approval is obtained  the company will seek to achieve broad market acceptance for the system integrating prep and autopap for cervical cancer screening 
there can be no assurance  however  when  if ever  such approval will be obtained 
tripath imaging launched the autopap gs  the next generation of autopap system  for use outside of the us in the fourth quarter of the autopap gs system  which screens both conventional pap smears and autocyte prep thin layer preparations  incorporates the company s slide wizard user interface and motorized microscopic stage to direct the cytologist to fields of view determined by the autopap to most likely contain abnormal cells 
the company anticipates initiating clinical trials in the second quarter of to obtain data to support an application for us approval of autopap gs by the fda

as a result of this arrangement  the company received from quest payments comprising a substantial portion of the company s total revenue for the year as quest has substantially performed its obligations under the agreement  the company does not expect to receive significant revenue under this agreement in the year the company s strategy is to maximize the number of instruments placed with customers and thereby increase its ongoing  higher margin reagent and fee per use revenue streams 
as an important element of this strategy  the company has entered into an agreement with a third party financial institution to support the placement of prep ipo systems and autopap fee per use systems 
tripath imaging s future revenues and the results of operations may change significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend on many factors  including the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the timing and volume of system placements  pricing of competitive products  the cost and effect of promotional discounts  sales  and marketing programs and strategies  introduction of alternative technologies by competitors  regulatory and reimbursement matters  preparation and submission of premarket approval applications to the fda  research and development activities  and the extent to which the company is successful in developing research and marketing alliances
