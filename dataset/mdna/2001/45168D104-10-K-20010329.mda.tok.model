as of december  and  approximately million and million cumulative shares  respectively  had been repurchased under this program 
see note the company believes that current cash and short term investments and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the foreseeable future 
future operating results the future operating results of the company are subject to a number of factors  including without limitation the following the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to develop new products and services both for its existing markets and for any new markets the company may enter in the future 
in recent years sales of the company s chemistry and hematology analyzers have declined as the company has achieved increasing market penetration 
future growth in sales of the company s analyzers and associated consumables will depend in part on the company s ability to introduce new systems with new features and capabilities 
the company is currently devoting significant resources to the development of such systems 
the company also plans to devote significant resources to the growth of many of its other businesses  including its animal health pharmaceuticals business 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development and commercialization of products and services for existing and new businesses or that such products and services  if commercialized  will be successful in the market 
the markets in which the company competes are subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
the company encounters  and expects to continue to encounter  intense competition in the sale of its current and future products and services 
in particular  the company has encountered increasing competition in the market for canine heartworm diagnostics and veterinary instruments 
certain of the company s competitors and potential competitors  including large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater capital  manufacturing  marketing and research and development resources than the company 
the development  manufacturing  distribution and marketing of certain of the company s products and provision of its services  both in the united states and abroad  are subject to regulation by various domestic and foreign governmental agencies  including the us department of agriculture  us food and drug administration fda and us environmental protection agency 
commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals requires submission of substantial clinical  manufacturing and other data to the fda and regulatory approval can take several years 
the fda also regulates all aspects of the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of animal drugs  including the monitoring of compliance with good manufacturing practice regulations 
non compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other sanctions  including the initiation of product seizures  injunction actions  criminal prosecutions  product recalls and withdrawals of approvals of products 
delays in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  any necessary regulatory approvals  or non compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has experienced and may experience in the future significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services  the mix of products and services sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenue could contribute to this quarterly variability 
in addition  because many of the company s products are sold through distributors  fluctuations may occur due to distributor purchasing patterns and distributor inventory management  which may be beyond the company s control 
the company operates with relatively little backlog  has few long term customer contracts and substantially all of its product and service revenue in each quarter results from orders received in that quarter 
as a result  the company s financial performance is susceptible to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels  and a shortfall in expected revenue could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
page the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that patent applications filed by the company will result in patents being issued  that any patents owned or licensed by the company will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies  or that the company s non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection for the company s trade secrets and other proprietary information 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  the company s business may be adversely affected by competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technologies 
in addition  the company may be required to obtain licenses to additional technologies from third parties in order to continue to sell certain products 
there can be no assurance that any technology licenses which the company desires or is required to obtain will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
the company s business historically has grown as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions of products and businesses 
identifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities  integrating acquired products and businesses  and managing growth require a significant amount of management time and skill 
there can be no assurance that the company will be effective in identifying and effecting attractive acquisitions  assimilating acquisitions or managing future growth 
from time to time  the company receives notices alleging that the company s products infringe third party proprietary rights 
in particular  the company has received notices claiming that certain of the company s immunoassay products infringe third party patents 
patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against the company  and an adverse outcome may preclude the company from selling certain products or require the company to pay damages or make additional royalty or other payments with respect to such sales 
in addition  from time to time other types of lawsuits are brought against the company  wherein an adverse outcome could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
certain of the company s products  and materials and components used in products  are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources 
the company currently purchases or is contractually required to purchase certain of the products that it sells  including its chemistry and hematology analyzers and associated consumables  active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and finished pharmaceutical products  from single sources 
the company s inability to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future  or to obtain sufficient sole or limited source products  materials or components  could result in cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
certain technologies licensed by the company and incorporated into its products also are available only from a single source  and the company s business may be adversely affected by the expiration or termination of any such licenses or any challenges to the technology rights underlying such licenses 
in  international revenue was million and accounted for of total revenue  and the company expects that its international business will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue 
foreign regulatory bodies often establish product standards different from those in the united states  and designing products in compliance with such foreign standards may be difficult or expensive 
other risks associated with foreign operations include possible disruptions in transportation of the company s products  the differing product and service needs of foreign customers  difficulties in building and managing foreign operations  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in foreign markets 
the development  manufacture  distribution and marketing of the company s products and provision of its services involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
although the company currently maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of the company s insurance policies will be adequate 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all
