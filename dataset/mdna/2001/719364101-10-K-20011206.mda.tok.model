generally  the words anticipate  expect  intend  believe and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
the information included in this form k is as of the filing date with the securities and exchange commission and future events or circumstances could differ significantly from the forward looking statements included here 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of photon dynamics appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of yield management solutions to the flat panel display fpd industry and offer yield management solutions for the printed circuit board pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging and crt display and crt glass and auto glass industries 
our pcb products and advanced semiconductor packaging inspection products are collectively referred to as our semiconductor inspection products 
our test  repair and inspection systems are used by manufacturers to collect data  analyze product quality and identify and repair product defects at critical steps in the manufacturing process 
in november  we acquired cr technology  inc this acquisition complemented our core capabilities of data acquisition  image analysis and systems engineering and enables us to broaden our product line to offer yield management solutions to the pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging markets 
prior to the acquisition  we derived revenue primarily from sales of fpd products to customers in japan  taiwan and korea where fpd production is concentrated 
in december  we acquired photon dynamics canada inc  formerly known as image processing systems inc ips  a canadian company 
this acquisition strengthened our ability to deliver market leading yield management solutions to the crt display and glass industry and we expect significant synergies that will benefit our customers 
in july  we acquired intelligent reasoning systems  inc irsi  a privately held company 
irsi manufactures in line  advanced optical inspection equipment for the electronic manufacturing markets 
this acquisition has further expanded our product portfolio for the pcb assembly electronics market utilizing patented knowledge based software 
we continue to derive the majority of our revenue from a small number of customers in the fpd industry 
our top four customers  each of whom are customers of our fpd products  accounted for of our revenue in fiscal we obtain revenue from the fpd industry through direct sales in korea and taiwan and a value added reseller in japan 
we obtain revenue from the crt display and glass industry through direct sales except in japan where we use a sales representative 
we obtain revenue from the pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging industry primarily through sales representatives 
sales of our fpd products represented million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of our pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging products represented million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of our crt display and glass products represented million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal financial statements reflect our adoption of sab  discussed below in impact of staff accounting bulletin number sab 
without giving effect to sab  revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and the net loss was million or per share in fiscal compared to net income of million or per share  as restated in fiscal results of operations fiscal years ended september   and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain items in our consolidated statement of operations year ended september  revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative non recurring acquisition charges acquired in process research and development restructure charges amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other  net income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax benefit net income loss revenue 
revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal sales of fpd products represented million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the general economic slowdown resulting in reduced capital spending by fpd manufacturers and to a lesser extent to the impact of the application of sab in fiscal the increase in revenue in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to increased capital spending by fpd manufacturers as a result of improved economic conditions in asia and increased demand for flat panel displays 
sales of our pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor inspection products represented million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue was unchanged in fiscal as compared to fiscal as reduced sales in x ray systems due to competitive pressures were offset by sales of next generation optical inspection systems 
the increase in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to increased sales of x ray and optical inspection systems 
sales of our crt display and glass products represented million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to increased sales of crt display products 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the decline in the growth of the crt market 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from the decrease in revenues and lower manufacturing volumes 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to increased capacity utilization resulting from higher production volume 
gross margin from fpd products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the change in gross margin was largely related to higher capacity utilization in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal gross margin from pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor inspection products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin from semiconductor inspection products in fiscal and compared to fiscal was primarily due to competitive pricing pressures on our x ray inspection systems 
gross margin from crt display and glass products decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin from crt display and glass products in fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a less favorable sales mix with increased sales of products with lower gross margins 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to our investment in personnel  consultants and prototype materials for the development of our arraychecker and arraysaver products 
also  in fiscal  we started work on our next generation cell and module inspection system which increased research and development expenses by  the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to our investment in personnel  consultants and prototype materials for the development of our arraychecker and xrv combo inspection systems that were introduced in the last half of fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  and of revenue  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to increased labor and related expenses after the acquisition of irsi 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to the establishment of a taiwan sales and customer support office  higher selling related expenses associated with increases in orders and revenue and our investment in additional personnel to expand our asia customer support capability 
non recurring acquisition and other charges 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal photon dynamics was restructured  which included a reduction in force and a reorganization of our divisions 
this resulted in restructuring charges of million for employee related costs and other expenses which were the result of several initiatives 
first  as we completed the integration of irsi into our electronics division  efficiencies were realized in that business 
second  in connection with our restructuring  we believed that significant savings would be achieved in the sales and service organization and related expenses 
third  in our continuing strategy for controlling costs  we downsized our capacity to current shipment levels 
in november  we acquired cr technology  inc  in exchange for approximately  shares of our common stock 
this acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in connection with this acquisition we incurred  in professional fees consisting of legal  accounting and investment banking fees 
in december  we acquired photon dynamics canada inc  formerly known as image processing systems inc ips  in exchange for approximately  shares of our common stock 
this acquisition was also accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we incurred million in professional fees consisting of legal  accounting and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of ips 
in july  we completed the acquisition of intelligent reasoning systems  inc irsi in which we issued  shares of our common stock  assumed a warrant  fair valued at  which upon closing of the acquisition and pursuant to the terms therein  became exercisable for  shares of our common stock and paid approximately million in cash million paid as of the date of the acquisition and million paid for assumed liabilities since the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets has been allocated to goodwill  intangible assets and the in process research and development in the amount of million  million and million respectively 
the identified intangible assets other than goodwill of million are being amortized over a three to five year period 
we have recorded amortization of intangibles of  for the year ended september  purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development  or iprd  of million in fiscal represents the write off of in process technology associated with our acquisition of irsi 
at the time of the acquisition  irsi was in the process of developing an intelligent optical inspection technology for their printed wire assembly market 
as this product had not reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date all costs associated with its purchase must be written off 
we used available information to calculate the amounts allocated to iprd 
in calculating iprd  we used established valuation techniques accepted in the high technology industry 
these calculations gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles and the estimated lives of each of the products underlying technology 
the value of the iprd reflects the relative value and contribution of the acquired research and development 
we used a discount rate of to compute the net present value of the future cash flows for the purpose of determining the value attributed to iprd 
we also gave consideration to the iprd s stage of completion 
we expect to continue the development of the technology and derivative commercial products and believe that there is a reasonable chance of successfully completing these development efforts 
there is  however  risk associated with the completion of the in process projects  and there can be no assurance that any project will achieve either technological or commercial success 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous income and expense 
interest income and other  net was million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income and other  net in fiscal and compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to interest income earned on higher cash and investment balances as a result of the net proceeds from a public offering in february provision for income taxes 
the fiscal  and effective tax rates were  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in fiscal  and is lower than the statutory rate due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
impact of staff accounting bulletin number sab in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financials statements sab 
the sec addressed several issues in sab  including the timing of revenue recognition for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product if these events occur after shipment and transfer of title 
our previous revenue recognition policy was to recognize revenue at the time the customer takes title to the product  generally at the time of shipment 
in october  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers sab faq  which clarifies many of the implementation questions surrounding sab we derive revenue from the following sources equipment sales and spare part sales 
we changed our revenue recognition policy effective october  based on guidance provided in sab we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of our product sales in our fpd and crt display and glass inspection products segments are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with the specific type of equipment  we recognize revenue for a portion of the total contract price due and billable upon shipment  with the remainder when it becomes due generally upon acceptance 
all other product sales with the customer acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue from the sale of our pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor inspection products is generally recognized upon shipment  as such product sales are not subject to customer acceptance holdbacks 
revenue from the sale of spare parts is recognized upon shipment 
the adoption of sab had no impact on the revenue recognition policy for the sale of spare parts or pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor inspection products 
we have reported this change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  as a cumulative effect adjustment 
because we are adopting sab in the fourth quarter  no cumulative effect of the change is included in net income in the fourth quarter 
instead  apb requires that the change be made as of the beginning of the year and that financial information for interim periods of fiscal reported prior to the change  be restated by applying sab to those periods 
in accordance with guidance provided in sab  we recorded a non cash charge of million  or per share in fiscal  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal the decrease in net income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change as a result of the adoption of sab amounted to million or per diluted share for fiscal the deferred revenue balance as of october  was million 
this amount is comprised of final holdback amounts of on equipment that was shipped for which final installation and acceptance had not occurred as of october  of this amount  million was recognized as revenue in fiscal the pro forma amounts presented in the income statement were calculated assuming the accounting change was retroactively applied to prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our growth primarily by a combination of cash flows from operations  public stock offerings  lines of credit and loans 
working capital was million as of september  compared to million as of september  a major component of working capital is million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of september  compared to million as of september  operating activities 
cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  while cash provided by operating activities was million and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the loss from operations and the decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
this was offset in part by a million decrease in accounts receivable due to reduced sales 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased net income and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  while cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to the liquidation of investments to fund the purchase of a new building and the acquisition of irsi 
in july we completed the acquisition of irsi in which we issued shares of our common stock and paid approximately million in cash million paid as of the date of the acquisition and million paid for assumed liabilities since the date of the acquisition 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily represented the investment of funds received from our public common stock offering in february capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal was for the purchase of a new building and other equipment to support our operations 
the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily for computers  equipment and leasehold improvements to support our expansion 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal was mainly due to our public common stock offering 
in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
we sold approximately  shares of our common stock  and approximately  shares were sold by one of our shareholders 
we received proceeds of approximately million  net of issuance costs  from the offering 
in march  we received additional proceeds of approximately million as a result of the underwriters exercising their over allotment option 
photon dynamics canada inc  formerly known as image processing systems inc ips  completed a special warrant financing in december of and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  ips received a repayable loan from the canadian government of  in fiscal and  in fiscal we have a borrowing capacity of million available under a bank line of credit that expires in march the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
at september   no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit 
we believe that existing liquid capital resources and funds generated from operations combined with the ability  if necessary  to borrow funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months 
we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise 
we may  from time to time  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies and may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in dilution to our shareholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no  impairment of long lived assets fas 
fas supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
fas retains the requirements of fas to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
fas removes goodwill from its scope 
fas is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   or for our fiscal year ended september  the adoption is not expected to have any material adverse impact on our financial position or results of our operations 
factors affecting operating results fluctuations in operating results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not necessarily determine actual sales for any succeeding period 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is derived from the sale of a small number of fpd yield management systems ranging in price from  to million 
therefore  the timing of the sale of a single system could have a significant impact on our quarterly results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
other factors which may influence our operating results in a particular quarter include o the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  o product mix  o competitive pricing pressures  o continued or worsened financial markets or economic instability in asia or the world in general  o the relative proportions of domestic and international sales  o our ability to design  manufacture and introduce new products on a cost effective and timely basis  o the delay between expenses to further develop marketing and service capabilities  o the realization of benefits from those improved capabilities  and o the introduction of new products by our competitors 
customer concentration the fpd industry is extremely concentrated with a small number of manufacturers producing the majority of the world s fpds 
sales of fpd products represented  and of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
lg phillips lcd co  ltd  samsung america  inc  ihi and quanta display inc  each of whom are customers of our fpd products  collectively accounted for of revenue in fiscal samsung america  inc  lg phillips lcd co  ltd  unipac optoelectronics corporation and hyundai electronics industries co  ltd  each of whom are customers of our fpd products  collectively accounted for of revenue in fiscal ihi  samsung america  inc and lg philips lcd co 
ltd  each of whom are customers of our fpd products  collectively accounted for of revenue in fiscal if one or more of our major customers ceased or significantly curtailed their purchases  our results of operations would be harmed 
flat panel display industry volatility our business depends in large part on capital expenditures by fpd manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for fpds and products that use fpds 
the fpd industry is highly cyclical and has experienced periods of oversupply resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
the fpd industry experienced a downturn in and  which led many fpd manufacturers to delay or cancel capital expenditures 
more recently  due to the deteriorating economic environment  fpd manufacturers have decreased capital expenditures  resulting in steadily declining revenues over the past four quarters 
our ability to increase our revenues in this market is directly tied to existing economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the fpd industry will not experience further downturns or slowdowns in the future  which may harm our business and operating results 
in addition  the need to invest in the engineering  research and development and marketing required to penetrate targeted foreign markets and maintain extensive service and support capabilities limits our ability to reduce expenses during such downturns 
international operations sales to countries other than the united states accounted for of revenue in fiscal  of revenue in fiscal and of revenue in fiscal we expect sales to these countries to continue to represent a significant percentage of revenue 
a number of factors may adversely affect our international sales and operations  including o imposition of governmental controls  o fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the foreign sales prices of our products in local currencies  o export license requirements  o restrictions on the export of technology  o political instability  o trade restrictions  o changes in tariffs  and o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
in and  many asian countries experienced an economic recession that resulted in a decline in the purchasing power of our asian customers 
a future downturn in economic conditions in asia could result in our customers failing to place new orders for our products 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact our operations in the future 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
key suppliers we obtain certain of the equipment for our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
for example  we currently obtain materials handling platforms  ultra high resolution cameras and high speed image processing systems for our fpd products from single source suppliers  one of which is experiencing financial difficulties and may cease operations  in which case our ability to manufacture our fpd products would be significantly impaired for a number of months 
we also currently obtain x ray equipment for our pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging products from limited source suppliers 
although we seek to reduce dependence on our sole and limited source suppliers  alternative sources of supply for such equipment may not be available or may be available on unfavorable terms 
the partial or complete loss of our sole and limited source suppliers could at least temporarily harm our results of operations and damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of such equipment could harm our results of operations 
japanese market and competition we believe that competing japanese companies in the fpd industry have a competitive advantage in japan because of the preference of some japanese customers for local equipment suppliers 
historically  foreign companies have found it difficult to penetrate the japanese market and often depend upon local sales channels to sell their products in japan 
since june  we have depended on ihi as our exclusive value added reseller to sell our fpd products in japan 
we anticipate that this relationship will continue in the future 
in fiscal  and   and of our revenue came from sales to ihi  respectively 
if ihi reduced the resources allocated to the development  systems construction  customization  sale and support of our fpd products in japan  our business would be harmed 
in addition  ihi s rights to continue as our exclusive value added reseller in japan are currently unresolved 
ihi may have the right to market some or all of our products in japan on an exclusive basis  even as to us 
if so  we may not be able to compete effectively in japan 
although ihi must purchase certain critical components from us  ihi may manufacture competing array test systems based on our technology 
if this occurs  our business could be harmed 
we have granted ihi the non exclusive right to manufacture and sell array test systems based on our technology  excluding technology incorporated into some critical components  in korea  taiwan and several other countries 
although ihi has never manufactured these products  nor sold these products in countries other than japan  our business could be harmed if ihi manufactures and sells array test systems in competition with our own in these countries 
competition the fpd  pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging  crt display and crt glass and auto glass industries are highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established competitors that have greater financial  engineering and manufacturing resources than us and have larger service organizations and long standing customer relationships 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may force price reductions that could harm our results of operations 
our customers may also develop technology and equipment which may reduce or eliminate their need to purchase our products 
although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  maintaining and capitalizing on these advantages will require us to continue a high level of investment in engineering  research and development  marketing and customer service support 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
new products and processes we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products 
for example  the size of fpd substrates and resolution of fpds have changed frequently and may continue to change requiring us to redesign or reconfigure our fpd products 
in addition  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales of products based upon active matrix liquid crystal display amlcd technology 
an industry shift away from amlcd technology to existing or new competing technologies could reduce the demand for our products and harm our business 
similarly  as semiconductors  pcbs and semiconductor packaging  crt display and glass technologies have become more complex  our wholly owned subsidiaries  cr technology  inc  intelligent reasoning systems  inc 
and photon dynamics canada inc  formerly known as image processing systems inc  have been forced to continually redefine their product offerings 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and cost effective manufacture of any of our new products  that we will be able to timely develop and introduce new products and enhance our existing products and processes to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance  or that the new markets for which we are developing new products or expect to sell current products will develop sufficiently 
to develop new products successfully  we depend on close relationships with our customers and the willingness of those customers to share information with us 
the failure to develop products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our competitive position and results of operations 
key employees our future success depends in part on our ability to retain key personnel  particularly senior management and engineers 
we also need to attract additional skilled personnel in all areas of our business to grow 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
other than kenneth wawrew  vice president  business development  we generally do not have employment contracts with our other key employees and do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
acquisitions we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses  such as the acquisition of cr technology in november  photon dynamics canada inc  formerly known as image processing systems inc 
in december and intelligent reasoning systems  inc in july future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets  which could harm our profitability 
in addition  current and future acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
there can be no assurance as to the effect of future acquisitions on our business or operating results 
intellectual property and infringement our success depends in large part on our intellectual property 
while we attempt to protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights and trade secrets  there can be no assurance that we will successfully protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
no assurance can be given that the claims allowed on any patents held by us will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  no assurance can be given that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
even if successful  litigation could be expensive and divert important management resources 
if our intellectual property were not properly protected  our business could be harmed 
regional electric shortages recently  california experienced an electric power supply shortage that has resulted in the intermittent loss of power in some areas in the form of rolling blackouts 
while we have not experienced any power failures to date  a blackout may affect our ability to manufacture products and meet scheduled deliveries 
if blackouts were to interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at some of our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers and could result in lost revenue  any of which could harm our business and results of operations 
environmental regulations some of our pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging products are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration  the california department of public health and other agencies in each jurisdiction where these products are sold or used 
compliance with these regulations is time consuming and expensive and may delay or even prevent sales in the united states or other jurisdictions 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could face fines or penalties  and sales of our products could be prohibited 
these fines  penalties and prohibitions could harm our business 
we are also subject to federal  state and local regulations related to the use  storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used in our manufacturing process 
failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed on us  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
new environmental regulations could also require us to purchase expensive equipment or incur other significant expenses to ensure compliance 
unanticipated environmental compliance costs could harm our business 
common stock price volatility the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors  such as o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors  o government regulations  o developments in patent or other property rights  and o developments in our relationships with our customers 
in addition  the stock market has in recent years experienced significant price fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
broad market fluctuations  general economic condition and specific conditions in the fpd  crt and glass and pcb assembly and advanced semiconductor packaging industries may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the current foreign exchange exposure in all international operations is immaterial 
we believe the impact of a change in exchange rates would not be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  we do not use derivative financial investments to hedge our current foreign exchange exposure 
market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our portfolio
