the notes bear interest at and will require payment of interest only for the first three years from the date of issuance and then repayment of interest and principal  on a straight line basis  over the next three years until maturity on the sixth anniversary of the date of issuance 
the principal amount may be convertible into our common stock at the option of the noteholders at any time prior to or at maturity

if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience additional dilution

if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents 
we invest our cash primarily in money market funds 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on capital lease obligations due to the fixed nature of such obligations 
we also have fixed rate notes payable to cmgi 
on october   cmgi agreed to convert these notes  including unamortized debt issuance costs  into our common stock 
we do not currently have any foreign operations and thus are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
