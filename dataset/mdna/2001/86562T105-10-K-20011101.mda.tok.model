comparative same business unit sales grew in the engineered polymer components segment due to expanded sales programs  new product introductions and market growth  declined in the extruded plastic products segment due to industry consolidation and competitive conditions  and grew on a consolidated basis in fiscal for the year ended august   net sales increased by  or  over the prior fiscal year  due to the inclusion of the results of newly acquired operations  substantially offset by decreased sales in previously owned operations 
comparative same business unit sales declined in the engineered polymer components segment  declined in the extruded plastic products segment  and declined overall  due to the general business downturn and discontinuation of some low margin commodity products 
of the decline  approximately was a result of the discontinuation of some commodity products and manufacturing services  primarily in the extruded plastic products segment 
sales weakened throughout the year as a result of a deteriorating economy 
tentative indications of strengthening  based on incoming orders  late in the fourth quarter and early in september were reversed after the september terrorist attacks  as orders fell off sharply for the remainder of the month 
it is not yet determinable whether the downward trend observed in fiscal will continue because of uncertainty due to the effects of the september attacks and ongoing related events

see business history of acquisitions continuing operations above 
as a percent of sales  operating expenses decreased from to  as a result of the inclusion of newly acquired operations  with historically lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales  for the entire fiscal year compared to partial inclusion in fiscal year  and as a result of more rapid sales growth than expense growth

interest expense increased from  for fiscal and  for fiscal to  for fiscal  due to higher average levels of debt during the year  partially offset by decreasing variable interest rates during fiscal interest expense relates primarily to interest on debt owed to banks  pursuant to the borrowing arrangement described in the liquidity and capital resources section below

for fiscal the effective tax rate decreased to primarily due to lower average state tax rates and increased foreign sales corporation tax benefit

without this non recurring benefit  the effective tax rate in fiscal would have been 
for fiscal  the effective tax rate further decreased to primarily due to the higher distribution of earnings in lower state tax jurisdictions  a higher percentage of foreign sales corporation tax benefit relative to pre tax earnings and certain other tax benefits 
the extraterritorial income exclusion of the us tax code  which replaces the foreign sales corporation tax  benefit has been challenged by the world trade organization and may be revised in the future 
if the code were changed to eliminate this benefit  the effective tax rate of the company would be approximately to higher 
inflation 
inflation did not have a significant impact on summa s operations during the two years ended august  except during the fourth quarter of fiscal during that period  oil price increases resulted in increasing and increasingly volatile costs of plastic resin  energy and transportation 
these factors did not have a material impact on the company s financial results until the fourth quarter  when they contributed significantly to reduced gross margins 
in  prices of plastic resins stabilized  and the company implemented price increases on selected products 
energy costs increased significantly in california 
during the year  the company reduced its exposure to california energy costs by relocating several operations to the midwest 
no significant amount of sales or purchases are made pursuant to fixed price  long term agreements 
segment information 
the following tables set forth the relative contribution of each segment to the sales and operating income of the entire company and the operating margins of each segment 
this data was derived from summa s consolidated statements of income for the three years ended august  relative contribution by segment net sales engineered polymer components extruded plastic products consolidated operating profit engineered polymer components extruded plastic products all other consolidated operating margin by segment operating margin engineered polymer components extruded plastic products consolidated from the foregoing discussion and above tables  it is apparent that the engineered polymer components segment comprises approximately of the company s sales and virtually all of the company s operating profit  and is growing faster than the extruded plastic products segment  a trend which is expected to continue for the operations which currently comprise the company 
the operating loss in the extruded plastics products in fiscal year was primarily the result of the discontinuation of certain commodity products and the associated plant consolidation expense incurred

capital spending declined in primarily because certain assets of acquired businesses were redeployed throughout the organization 
although summa expects to continue making substantial investments in tooling for new products  at august   summa was not committed to any outside supplier for major capital expenditures  and believes its present capacity  augmented by anticipated continued investment in new product tooling and equipment  will be sufficient to meet demand for its products

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk relates to interest rate exposure on long term borrowings 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
excess cash is primarily used to pay down the revolving line of credit 
borrowings against the revolving line of credit  certain real estate loans and industrial development bonds are at variable interest rates 
all other borrowings are at fixed rates 
at august   the company had  outstanding against variable rate loans with variable rates ranging from percent to percent in traunches  with variable interest rates or rates fixed for periods of from days to years 
a one percent increase in interest rates charged on the company s outstanding variable rate borrowings would result in interest expense increasing by approximately  per year  assuming the total outstanding amount of variable interest debt remained constant
