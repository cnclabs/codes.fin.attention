statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
general in may  the company acquired dynamex express  the ground courier operations of air canada dynamex express  which was led by richard k 
mcclelland  the company s chief executive officer  and which had a national network of locations across canada 
in december  the company acquired the on demand ground courier operations of mayne nickless incorporated and mayne nickless canada inc which had operations in eight us cities and two canadian cities 
in august in conjunction with its initial public offering ipo  the company acquired five same day delivery businesses in three us and two canadian cities 
subsequent to the ipo and through july   the company acquired same day delivery businesses in six us and two canadian cities 
between august  and july   the company acquired nine same day delivery businesses in eight us cities and one canadian city 
in august  the company acquired two same day delivery businesses in two us cities 
as a result of these various acquisitions  the historical operating results of the company for the periods presented are not necessarily comparable 
sales consist primarily of charges to customers for individual delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as fleet management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the yield revenue per transaction for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher yields 
cost of sales consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including driver and messenger costs and third party delivery charges  if any 
substantially all of the drivers used by the company own their own vehicles  and approximately of these owner operators are independent contractors as opposed to employees of the company 
drivers and messengers are generally compensated based on a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  the company s driver and messenger costs are variable in nature 
to the extent that the drivers and messengers are employees of the company  employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs incurred at the branch level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative costs related to such functions 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to branch and corporate locations 
generally  the company s on demand services provide higher gross profit margins than do scheduled distribution or fleet management services because driver compensation for on demand services is generally lower as a percentage of sales from such services 
however  scheduled distribution and fleet management services generally have fewer administrative requirements related to order taking  dispatching drivers and billing 
as a result of these variances  the company s margins are dependent in part on the mix of business for a particular period 
as the company has no significant investment in transportation equipment  depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to depreciation of office  communication and computer equipment and the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the company s various acquisitions  each of which has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a significant portion of the company s revenues is generated in canada 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were generated in canada 
before deduction of corporate costs  the majority of which are incurred in the us  the cost structure of the company s operations in the us and in canada is very similar 
consequently  when expressed as a percentage of us or canadian sales  as appropriate  the operating profit generated in each such country before deduction of corporate costs is not materially different 
the conversion rate between the us dollar and canadian dollar decreased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  the conversion rate between the us dollar and canadian dollar increased during the fiscal year ending july  as compared to july  as the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the company s canadian operations  these changes in the exchange rate have effected the company s reported revenues 
the effect of these changes on the company s net income loss for the fiscal years ended july   and has not been significant  although there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such currency exchange rate will not  in the future  have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations

sales for the year ended july  were million compared to million in  a decline of less than 
the decline is attributable to a number of factors 
first  the company exited approximately million of marginally profitable business in several locations in canada at the beginning of fiscal year second  the economic slowdown in the us negatively impacted us sales in  primarily in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
third  the decline in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar had the effect of reducing sales by slightly over million had the exchange rate been the same as the prior year 
sales growth for the fiscal year will be negatively impacted by the loss of approximately million of sales to a single customer who had informed the company in the third quarter of fiscal year that the contract will be phased out over the next months 
while the company is disappointed in the loss of this contract  a large portion of the services provided is not part of the company s core competencies 
cost of sales increased million to million in compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from in to in this increase in cost is primarily attributable to a change in the overall business mix of the company 
on demand sales were approximately of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year scheduled and distribution and other specialized service revenues increased as a percentage of total sales while on demand revenues have declined both as percentage of sales and in absolute dollars 
historically on demand revenues have lower cost of sales and higher selling  general and administrative costs compared to scheduled and distribution and other specialized service revenues 
as a result of this change in business mix  cost of sales has increased as a percentage of sales while sg a costs have declined as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs were million for the fiscal year ended july  compared to million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased from in to in the decline from to is attributable to a number of factors 
sales commissions were lower million in the current year due to a decline in new sales that was due  in large part  to the slowing us economy in the dallas and chicago branch operations were restructured along with cost saving initiatives at other locations resulted in reduced administrative costs million and improved profitability 
in the prior year  the company incurred contract accounting labor costs million associated with the audit of fiscal year and the re audit of fiscal years and legal and other professional fees associated with the class action lawsuit were substantially less million than the prior year because of the settlement announced early in fiscal year the consolidation of certain administrative functions including billing and collections resulted in reduced employee related costs in fiscal year in the prior year  the company also invested more heavily in technology in building its infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization was million in compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to the reduction in amortization of covenants not to compete that are fully amortized after three years and to a reduction in depreciation of property and equipment 
most of the company s acquisitions occurred in fiscal years through  therefore  all covenants were fully amortized prior to or during the current fiscal year 
in addition certain property and equipment acquired through acquisitions has been fully depreciated and has not been replaced with new equipment because the old equipment is still in service 
also the company has or will replace driver communication equipment with two way mobile data units that do not require an up front capital expenditure by the company 
interest expense decreased million or in the fiscal year ended july  compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a lower level of debt in and lower interest rates in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
in the prior year fourth quarter  the bank group imposed the default rate of interest in accordance with the bank credit agreement because the company did not have audited financial statements on file with the securities and exchange commission for the prior three years 
also in the prior year fourth quarter  the company was assessed special fees by the bank group of approximately  year ended july  compared to year ended july  the net loss for the year ended july  was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended july  the results for include a provision for the tentative settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuit of million 
the results for were also negatively impacted by non recurring and unusual charges and adjustments 
selling  general and administrative costs include non recurring audit fees of approximately million related to the audit and the re audit and restatement of the results for the years ended july  and  professional fees in support of the special committee review of million  million for the write off of costs associated with the failed q international and other acquisitions  and million for severance and other restructuring costs 
in addition  the company reduced the carrying value of goodwill and covenants not to compete for its dallas  texas and hartford  connecticut operations in the fourth quarter of by million 
the company also provided a valuation allowance of approximately million and million for federal net operating losses and the shareholder class action lawsuit settlement incurred in the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the aforementioned non recurring and unusual charges and adjustments in this paragraph 
sales for the year ended july  increased to million from million from the prior year 
sales for were negatively impacted in three locations 
in hartford  connecticut the company exited an unprofitable line of business in fiscal year at the dallas  texas branch location  the combination of additional competition and the problems encountered in the conversion of the two existing legacy customer order processing systems to the standard cops system and combining two business units resulted in a significant sales decline for this branch 
in the prairie region of canada alberta and saskatchewan provinces  the company lost a major contract when the customer decided to do the work in house 
excluding these operations  revenue growth would have been 
management believes sales growth for the fiscal year will be negatively impacted because the company has elected to exit approximately million annually of marginally profitable business in several locations in canada 
cost of sales increased approximately million or to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased from in the fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in this percentage primarily results from the change in business mix from to historically  cost of sales for on demand revenues are lower than the costs associated with other types of business 
on demand sales were approximately of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this decline can be attributed somewhat to the impact of e mail on same day deliveries and to the company s sales effort to increase other types of business 
management believes that cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  will remain or be slightly above its current level in fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a costs were million for the fiscal year ended july  compared to million excluding million in unusual charges and adjustments described above for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in compared to in included in the year  are non recurring costs of million for temporary accounting assistance required to complete the fiscal year audit and the re audit of the and fiscal years 
in addition  the fiscal year ended july  includes million in legal costs associated with the shareholder lawsuit 
the company recently announced a tentative settlement of the lawsuit 
management expects legal costs associated with the shareholder lawsuit in fiscal year to be substantially less than the amounts incurred in fiscal year the company has recently initiated a new sales program aimed specifically at national accounts 
in this regard  the company will increase the number of sales personnel to implement this program 
in addition  a number of initiatives are currently in process to streamline administrative processes and to reduce general and administrative costs 
management expects sg a costs to remain at or be slightly below their current level as a percentage of sales in the fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization was million in the fiscal year ended july  compared to million in the fiscal year ended july   after adjustment for the million reduction in the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles described above 
as a percentage of sales  depreciation and amortization was in versus in management expects depreciation and amortization to continue to decline in fiscal year both as a percentage of sales and dollar amount due primarily to the reduction in amortization of covenants not to compete 
the covenants are amortized over a three year period and substantially all covenants will be fully amortized by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year interest expense increased million or in the fiscal year ended july  compared to the same period in the higher interest expense in resulted from higher interest rates in reaction to the increases imposed by the federal reserve board during the year  the additional financing costs associated with amending and extending the bank credit agreement terms and the imposition by the banks of the default rate of interest in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources in fiscal years ended july  and  the company s capital needs arose primarily from its capital expenditures and working capital needs 
there were no acquisitions made in fiscal year or in the fiscal year ended july   the company s capital needs arose primarily from its acquisition program 
during the fiscal year ended july   the company completed two acquisitions for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions  the company agreed to pay the sellers additional consideration if the acquired operations met certain performance goals related to their earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted for certain factors 
in conjunction with the acquisitions  the company issued  shares of common stock and paid approximately million in cash during the fiscal year ended july  as additional consideration

during the fiscal years ended july   and  the company spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on capital expenditures  which expenditures primarily related to improvements in infrastructure and technology to support the company s operations 
management expects the amount of capital expenditures for these purposes in future years to be at or below expenditures made in the year ended july  the company does not have significant capital expenditure requirements to replace or expand the number of vehicles used in its operations because substantially all of its drivers are owner operators who provide their own vehicles 
the company s expansion of its national marketing program consists primarily of increased hiring and salary expenditures related to additional product specialists 
these marketing expenditures have not  nor does management expect that in the future they will have  a significant impact on the company s liquidity 
see business sales and marketing 
the company s cash flow provided by operations for the fiscal years ended july   and were approximately million  and million  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange exposure significant portions of the company s operations are conducted in canada 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar result in fluctuations in the amounts relating to the canadian operations reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company historically has not entered into hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency exposure  but may do so in the future 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for foreign exchange exposure compares the revenue and net income figures from canadian operations over the previous four quarters at the actual exchange rate versus a decrease in the exchange rate 
based on this model  a decrease would result in a decrease in revenue of million and a decrease in net income of 
million over this period 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the control of the company s management 
interest rate exposure the company has entered into interest rate protection arrangements on a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility 
effective september  the company entered into a new interest rate protection arrangement on million of the borrowings under the credit agreement 
the interest rate on million was fixed at  plus the applicable margin 
these hedging arrangements matured on july  on november   the company entered into an interest rate protection arrangement on million of borrowings under the credit agreement 
the interest rate on million was fixed at 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for interest rate exposure compares interest expense fluctuations over a one year period based on current debt levels and current interest rates versus current debt levels at current interest rates with a increase 
based on this model  a increase would result in an increase in interest expense of 
million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected interest rate increase will materialize 
fluctuations of interest rates are beyond the control of the company s management
