item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled petsmart stores  distribution  information systems  competition  government regulation  and business risks included in this form k for the year ended january  
table of contents overview petsmart is the leading provider of products  services  and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets 
at january   the company operated retail stores in north america  as well as the internet s most popular pet e commerce site  and several major branded catalogs and affiliated web sites that market supplies for pets and horses 
the company offers a broad line of products for all the life stages of pets and is the nation s largest provider of high quality grooming and pet training services 
through its strategic partnership with banfield  the pet hospital  petsmart provides full service veterinary care in approximately half its stores 
during fiscal  the company opened new retail stores  including four replacement stores  and closed two stores in north america 
the company expects that any future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on the opening of additional stores and the improved performance of existing stores 
in view of the increasing maturity of its store base an average age of years as of january   as well as the planned opening of additional stores in existing markets  the company anticipates that comparable store sales increases may be lower in future periods 
as a result of its expansion plans  the company anticipates the timing of new store openings  related preopening expenses  and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores may cause the company s quarterly results to fluctuate 
in addition  because new stores have higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  the impact of new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until they become established 
the company charges preopening costs associated with each new location to earnings as the costs are incurred 
therefore  the company expects that the opening of large numbers of new stores in a given quarter will adversely impact its quarterly results of operations for that period
