the company s unit sales of towable products were up from to as both the holiday rambler and mckenzie towable operations reported strong increases 
the company s sales of towable units had been dampened in by the consolidation of the two indiana based towable facilities into one company owned facility in elkhart  indiana 
this consolidation slowed unit production volume in that facility in the second quarter of  and production of towables in indiana was constrained in the second half of while that plant was expanded and remodeled

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
factors that may affect future operating results potential fluctuations in operating results the company s net sales  gross margin and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to factors such as the mix of products sold  the ability to utilize and expand manufacturing resources efficiently  material shortages  the introduction and consumer acceptance of new models offered by the company  competition  the addition or loss of dealers  the timing of trade shows and rallies  and factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole 
in addition  the company s overall gross margin on its products may decline in future periods to the extent the company increases its sales of lower gross margin towable products or if the mix of motor coaches sold shifts to lower gross margin units 
due to the relatively high selling prices of the company s products in particular  its high line class a motor coaches  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles sold in any quarter can have a significant effect on sales and operating results for that quarter 
demand in the overall recreational vehicle industry generally declines during the winter months  while sales and revenues are generally higher during the spring and summer months 
with the broader range of recreational vehicles now offered by the company  seasonal factors could have a significant impact on the company s operating results in the future 
in addition  unusually severe weather conditions in certain markets could delay the timing of shipments from one quarter to another 
cyclicality the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic  demographic and political conditions that affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
unit sales of recreational vehicles excluding conversion vehicles reached a peak of approximately  units in and declined to approximately  units in the industry peaked again in at approximately  units and began declining thereafter as unit sales in were approximately  units 
furthermore  the company offers a broad range of recreational vehicle products and is susceptible to the cyclicality inherent in the recreational vehicle industry 
factors affecting cyclicality in the recreational vehicle industry include fuel availability and fuel prices  prevailing interest rates  the level of discretionary spending  the availability of credit and overall consumer confidence 
in particular  the decline in consumer confidence and or a slowing of the overall economy has had a material adverse effect on the recreational vehicle market 
an extended continuance of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
management of growth over the past several years the company has experienced significant growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its business 
this growth has resulted in the addition of new management personnel and increased responsibilities for existing management personnel  and has placed added pressure on the company s operating  financial and management information systems 
while management believes it has been successful in managing this expansion there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter problems in the future associated with the continued growth of the company 
failure to adequately support and manage the growth of its business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
manufacturing expansion the company has significantly increased its manufacturing capacity over the last few years 
the integration of the company s facilities and the expansion of the company s manufacturing operations involve a number of risks including unexpected building and production difficulties 
in the past the company experienced startup inefficiencies in manufacturing a new model and also has experienced difficulty in increasing production rates at a plant 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully integrate its manufacturing facilities or that it will achieve the anticipated benefits and efficiencies from its expanded manufacturing operations 
in addition  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected if sales of the company s products do not increase at a rate sufficient to offset the company s increased expense levels resulting from this expansion 
the setup of new models and scale up of production facilities involve various risks and uncertainties  including timely performance of a large number of contractors  subcontractors  suppliers and various government agencies that regulate and license construction  each of which is beyond the control of the company 
the setup of production for new models involves risks and costs associated with the development and acquisition of new production lines  molds and other machinery  the training of employees  and compliance with environmental  health and safety and other regulatory requirements 
the inability of the company to complete the scale up of its facilities and to commence full scale commercial production in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company may from time to time experience lower than anticipated yields or production constraints that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy customer orders 
any prolonged inability to satisfy customer demand could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
concentration of sales to certain dealers although the company s products were offered by dealerships located primarily in the united states and canada at the end of  a significant percentage of the company s sales have been and will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of independent dealers 
sales to lazy days rv center  inc accounted for of the company s sales in and in the company s largest dealers  including lazy days rv center  inc  accounted for a combined of sales in and in the loss of a significant dealer or a substantial decrease in sales by such a dealer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

potential liability under repurchase agreements as is common in the recreational vehicle industry  the company enters into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by its dealers to finance their purchases 
these agreements obligate the company to repurchase a dealer s inventory under certain circumstances in the event of a default by the dealer to its lender 
if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of its products in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  business and results of operations 
the company s contingent obligations under repurchase agreements vary from period to period and totaled approximately million as of december   with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
see liquidity and capital resources and note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
availability and cost of fuel an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the price or tax on the sale  of diesel fuel or gasoline on a regional or national basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
diesel fuel and gasoline have  at various times in the past  been difficult to obtain  and there can be no assurance that the supply of diesel fuel or gasoline will continue uninterrupted  that rationing will not be imposed  or that the price of or tax on diesel fuel or gasoline  which have increased in price in the past year  will not significantly increase in the future  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on certain suppliers a number of important components for certain of the company s products are purchased from single or limited sources  including its turbo diesel engines cummins  substantially all of its transmissions allison  axles dana for all diesel motor coaches and chassis workhorse and ford for certain of its motorhome products 
the company has no long term supply contracts with these suppliers or their distributors  and there can be no assurance that these suppliers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for these components 
in  allison put all chassis manufacturers on allocation with respect to one of the transmissions the company uses  and in ford put one of its gasoline powered chassis on allocation 
the company presently believes that its allocation by suppliers of all components is sufficient to meet planned production volumes  and the company does not foresee any operating difficulties as a result of vendor supply issues 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that allison  ford  or any of the company s other suppliers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for transmissions  chassis or other key components 
an extended delay or interruption in the supply of any components obtained from a single or limited source supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business changes 
new product introductions the company believes that the introduction of new features and new models will be critical to its future success 
delays in the introduction of new models or product features or a lack of market acceptance of new models or features and or quality problems with new models or features could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  unexpected costs associated with model changes have adversely affected the company s gross margin in the past 
future product introductions could divert revenues from existing models and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company currently competes with a number of other manufacturers of motor coaches  fifth wheel trailers and travel trailers  many of which have significant financial resources and extensive distribution capabilities 
there can be no assurance that either existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to  or that achieve better consumer acceptance than  the company s products  or that the company will continue to remain competitive 
risks of litigation the company is subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business  including a variety of product liability and warranty claims typical in the recreational vehicle industry 
although the company does not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation  net of insurance coverage  will have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company  due to the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation there can be no assurance in this regard 
to date  the company has been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms the company considers acceptable 
the company s current policies jointly provide coverage against claims based on occurrences within the policy periods up to a maximum of million for each occurrence and million in the aggregate 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at acceptable levels or that the costs of insurance will be reasonable 
furthermore  successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities 
during  the company had cash flows of million from operating activities 
the company generated million from net income and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  which was offset by a net increase in the company s working capital accounts 
accounts receivable increased million related to significant shipments during the final two weeks of the year 
inventories increased by million reflecting the company s plan to carry higher than normal finished goods levels to keep efficient production run rates 
these increases were only partially offset by the million increase in accounts payable 
during the third quarter of  the company paid off its revolving line of credit and obtained a commitment from another lender for financing 
as part of the transition between credit facilities  the company s new lender issued the company a temporary revolving line of credit of up to million the temporary revolving loan which was paid on january  the company s new permanent credit facility consists of a revolving line of credit of up to million the revolving loan 
at the election of the company  the revolving loan bears interest at variable interest rates based on the prime rate or libor 
the revolving loan is due and payable in full on april   and requires monthly interest payments 
the balance outstanding under the temporary revolving loan at december  was million 
the revolving loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the company and includes various restrictions and financial covenants 
the company utilizes zero balance bank disbursement accounts in which an advance on the line of credit is automatically made for checks clearing each day 
since the balance of the disbursement account at the bank returns to zero at the end of each day the outstanding checks of the company are reflected as a liability 
the outstanding check liability is combined with the company s positive cash balance accounts to reflect a net book overdraft or a net cash balance for financial reporting 
the company s principal working capital requirements are for purchases of inventory and financing of trade receivables 
the company s dealers typically finance product purchases under wholesale floor plan arrangements with third parties as described below 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million  an increase of million from working capital of million at january  the company has been using short term credit facilities and cash flow to finance its construction of facilities and other capital expenditures 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  primarily for the expansion of facilities which began in late including the new diesel chassis manufacturing facility in elkhart  indiana and upgrading the service and warranty facilities in both oregon and indiana as well as a new service center in florida 
in the fiscal year  the company also spent about to million on routine capital expenditures for computer system upgrades and additions  smaller scale plant remodeling projects and normal replacement of outdated or worn out equipment 
the company is expecting capital expenditures in to be approximately to million  which includes completing the company s warranty and service center projects and minor modifications to existing manufacturing facilities 
the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address working capital and facilities expansion needs  particularly if the company significantly increases the level of working capital assets such as inventory and accounts receivable 
the company may also from time to time seek to acquire businesses that would complement the company s current business  and any such acquisition could require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if required or on terms deemed favorable by the company 
as is typical in the recreational vehicle industry  many of the company s retail dealers utilize wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third party lending institutions to finance their purchases of the company s products 
under the terms of these floor plan arrangements  institutional lenders customarily require the recreational vehicle manufacturer to agree to repurchase any unsold units if the dealer fails to meet its commitments to the lender  subject to certain conditions 
the company has agreements with several institutional lenders under which the company currently has repurchase obligations 
the company s contingent obligations under these repurchase agreements are reduced by the proceeds received upon the sale of any repurchased units 
the company s obligations under these repurchase agreements vary from period to period 
at december   approximately million of products sold by the company to independent dealers were subject to potential repurchase under existing floor plan financing agreements with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement  its business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected
