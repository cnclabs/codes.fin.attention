item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry and company outlook cavalier homes  inc and its subsidiaries are engaged in the production  sale  financing  and insuring of manufactured housing 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many of the same economic and demographic factors that affect the housing market as a whole 
as a result of the growth in the industry during much of the s  the number of retail dealerships  manufacturing capacity and wholesale shipments expanded significantly  which ultimately created slower retail turnover  higher retail inventory levels and increased price competition 
inventory oversupply at the retail level continues to have a significant impact on wholesale shipments as it did during much of the manufactured housing institute mhi reported that industry wholesale floor shipments declined in as compared to  falling in the fourth quarter alone 
the industry also has been impacted by an increase in dealer failures  higher interest rates  a reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels 
in response to deteriorating market conditions  manufacturers have closed or idled some of their manufacturing facilities and retail dealers have closed some locations 
the company also believes that the possibility exists for additional retail dealer failures  as well as for the loss of additional lenders from the industry  and a further reduction in the availability of wholesale and retail financing 
industry conditions significantly impacted cavalier s business and financial results during the company is uncertain at this time as to the extent and duration of these developments and as to what effect these factors will have on the company s future sales and earnings 
the company currently believes these conditions will continue to adversely affect its financial performance at least through the second quarter and perhaps through the end of the company s revenues during the first quarter to date continue to be substantially below the same period in  and the company currently expects to record a significant loss in the first quarter of due to deteriorating market conditions  during  the company recorded impairment and other related charges of   after tax or per diluted share in connection with the closing of four home manufacturing facilities  company owned retail sales centers  the sale of a portion of the company s insurance and premium finance business a step related to the scaling back of the company s retail operations  and the expected disposition of a portion of the company s supply operations 
since the fall of  cavalier idled nine home manufacturing plants  one of which was re opened during the fourth quarter of  and disposed of the operations of one other 
another plant was destroyed by fire in june a previously idled facility was re opened to replace that capacity 
consequently  cavalier  at december   operated a total of home manufacturing facilities  reflecting an approximate one third reduction in manufacturing capacity over the last year

the company can give no assurance as to which one or more of these options  if any  it may ultimately adopt  and  if adopted  whether and to what extent these actions will have an effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company

the company has an amended revolving and term loan agreement the credit facility with its primary lender 
the maturity date under the revolving line of credit available under the credit facility is set at april the credit facility currently consists of a  revolving and term loan agreement and contains a revolving line of credit that provides for borrowings including letters of credit up to a maximum of  if the company s tangible net worth  defined as the total of the company s tangible net worth and treasury stock purchases for and  is less than  the amount available under the credit facility is reduced from  to of the company s tangible net worth 
however  in no event may the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit and term loan agreement exceed  or such lesser amount as may be available 
at december    was outstanding under the revolving line of credit  against a total lending capacity of  based on the company s tangible net worth 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 
interest is payable under the revolving line of credit at the bank s prime rate less  or  if elected by the company  the day libor rate plus 
if the company s tangible net worth is below  the interest rate changes to the bank s prime rate or  if elected by the company  the day libor rate plus 
the credit facility provides the option for amounts drawn down for cis s benefit to be converted to a term loan with respect to borrowings of up to of the company s eligible as defined installment sales contracts  up to a maximum of  or such lesser amount as may be available 
interest under the term notes is fixed for a period of five years from issuance at a rate based on the weekly average yield on five year treasury securities averaged over the preceding weeks  plus  with a floating rate for the remaining two years subject to certain limits equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
the credit facility  as amended  contains certain restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  the company s ability without the lender s consent to i make dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock in an aggregate amount which exceeds of consolidated net income for the two most recent years  ii mortgage or pledge assets which exceed  in the aggregate   iii incur additional indebtedness  including lease obligations  which exceed in the aggregate  excluding floor plan notes payable which cannot exceed  and iv make annual capital expenditures in excess of  in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain on a consolidated basis certain defined levels of net working capital at least  debt to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to and cash flow to debt service ratio not less than to commencing with the year ending december  and thereafter  and to maintain a current ratio of at least to and the sum of consolidated tangible net worth plus treasury stock purchases  in and  of at least  the credit facility also requires cis to comply with certain specified see safe harbor statement on page restrictions and financial covenants 
cavalier was not in violation of any financial covenants of the amended credit facility at december  since its inception  cis has been restricted in the amounts of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
in february  cis entered into an agreement with another lender providing for the periodic resale of a portion of cis s loans that meet established criteria and without recourse provided that the transferred loan was properly originated by the dealer and purchased by cis 
in march and in june  cis sold  under this retail finance agreement  a substantial portion of its existing portfolio of loans on those dates 
in april  the company received proceeds of approximately  from the sale of loans that were previously held in its installment loan portfolio 
the effect of these transactions on net income was to reduce the amount of financial services revenue from interest income on these portions of the portfolio  offset by reduced interest expense on debt retired in march and earnings on the remaining proceeds 
from time to time  the company evaluates the potential to sell all or a portion of its remaining installment loan portfolio  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cis in the future 
while the original retail finance contract is no longer in effect  cis is currently continuing to re sell loans to other lenders under various retail finance contracts 
the company believes the periodic sale of installment contracts under these retail finance agreements will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase the company s liquidity  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance the ability of cis to increase its volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under these agreements  or that cis and the company will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreements 
the company currently believes existing cash and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations and cash received from income tax refunds  will be adequate to fund the company s operations and plans for the balance of fiscal year however  there can be no assurances to this effect 
if it is not  the company could seek to enhance its liquidity position through further modifications to the credit facility  incurrence of additional short or long term indebtedness or other forms of financing  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions  the availability and terms of which will depend on various factors and market and other conditions  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
impact of inflation the company generally has been able to increase its selling prices to offset increased costs  including the costs of raw materials 
sudden increases in costs as well as price competition  however  can affect the ability of the company to increase its selling prices 
as discussed above  in  the company experienced tightened supply of certain types of raw materials  which resulted in some higher costs that were not recoverable through price increases 
for a further discussion of this matter  see compared to gross profit 
the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a significant impact on its sales or profitability  but can give no assurance that this trend will continue in the future

market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments  but is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
see safe harbor statement on page the company is exposed to market risk related to investments held in a non qualified trust used to fund benefits under its deferred compensation plan 
these investments totaled  at december  due to the long term nature of the benefit liabilities that these assets fund  the company currently considers its exposure to market risk to be low 
the company does not believe that a decline in market value of these investments would result in a material near term funding of the trust or exposure to the benefit liabilities funded 
the company purchases retail installment contracts from its dealers  at fixed interest rates  in the ordinary course of business  and periodically resells a majority of these loans to financial institutions under the terms of retail finance agreements 
the periodic resale of installment contracts reduces the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  as the majority of contracts are held for a short period of time 
the company s portfolio consists of fixed rate contracts with interest rates generally ranging from to and an average original term of months at december  the company estimated the fair value of its installment contracts receivable which approximates carrying value  using discounted cash flows and interest rates offered by cis on similar contracts at december  the company has notes payable under retail floor plan agreements  an industrial development revenue bond issue and a revolving line of credit that are exposed to interest rate changes 
since these borrowings are floating rate debt  an increase in short term interest rates would adversely affect interest expense 
additionally  cavalier has five industrial development revenue bond issues at fixed interest rates 
the estimated fair value of outstanding borrowings approximated carrying value at december  the company estimated the fair value of its debt instruments using rates at which the company believes it could have obtained similar borrowings at that time
