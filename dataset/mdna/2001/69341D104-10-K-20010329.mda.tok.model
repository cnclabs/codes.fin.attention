item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company offers placement  purchase and leasing alternatives to customers interested in acquiring the heart laser systems 
the company has developed a strategy to address the challenges of marketing high cost capital equipment by offering the heart laser systems on a usage basis to hospitals 
the particular structure of a usage based contract  including the length of contract  price billed per procedure and end of term options for purchase  depends primarily on whether the hospital is willing and able to commit to a certain minimum volume of procedures over a defined period of time 
if the hospital cannot commit to a sufficient number of procedures  the heart laser systems may be installed with usage fees billed as agreed upon with the hospital 
the company refers to this type of usage arrangement as a retained placement contract 
under a retained placement contract  placement and service fee revenues are recorded over the term of the usage agreement and the heart laser systems remain the property of the company and are depreciated over the term of the usage agreement 
if the hospital is willing and able to commit to a sufficient number of procedures at a sufficient procedural fee  such that the substantial risks and benefits of ownership of the heart laser systems have transferred to the hospital  then the company classifies the usage agreement as a minimum procedure sales contract qualifying as a sales type lease 
under a minimum procedure sales contract  the company records product revenues  at a discounted present value of the guaranteed minimum procedure payments  and records product cost of sale at the time of acceptance of the heart laser systems 
the company believes that retained placement and minimum procedure sales contracts are appealing to hospitals when capital equipment funds are scarce or unavailable or when it is difficult to predict early usage as is the case with new technology such as tmr 
the company s financing arrangements with leasing vendors has enabled the company to monetize future payment streams associated with certain agreements 
if utilization becomes more predictable  the company expects a significant number of new accounts to opt for conventional leasing  or direct purchase 
the heart laser systems are also sold directly to customers  and the related sterile handpieces and other disposables are sold separately 
these sales are classified as product sales 
customers are given the option to purchase service contracts to cover the cost of maintaining the heart laser systems beyond the applicable warranty period 
these service revenues are recorded ratably over the service contract and are classified as a component of placement and service fees 
beginning in  under an exclusive distribution arrangement with edwards  edwards will determine the best programs  including sale  lease and rental offerings  which it believes will be most effective in the united states in marketing the hl and related tmr kits to hospitals 
plc will sell these products to edwards at a discount off list price and will generally recognize product sales revenues at the time of shipment to edwards 
the company expects that its revenues and gross profit in will likely be lower than corresponding quarters in excluding the impact on gross margin of a non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of as a result of the discounted sale price of lasers and tmr procedural kits when sold to edwards  until such time  if ever  that edwards marketing efforts result in substantially increased tmr procedural volumes and corresponding kit sales 
a portion of the company s operations is conducted outside of the united states 
historically the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the company s overall consolidated results of operations has not been material see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  decreased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  contributing factors to the decrease in revenues are a decline in the number of hl sales transactions recognized during the year coupled with a decrease in the average selling price for the hl in and reduced royalties 
the company recorded hl sales transactions in compared to hl sales transactions in the decrease in the number of hl sales transactions recognized resulted primarily from the company s shift from a sale to a placement business model strategy and  in the latter part of the year  redirected focus on launching the next generation hl  for which the company received fda approval in january placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  increased from placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  this increase in placement and service revenues is primarily due to the company s implementation of its laser redeployment strategy  which focused on moving lasers from less active sites to sites which are potentially more productive 
management of the company also monitors disposable kit shipments as an important metric in evaluating its business 
management believes kit shipments  although not a direct measure  are reasonable indicators of the pace of the adoption of tmr as a therapy in the marketplace 
for the year ended december   the company shipped  disposable kits  an increase of over the  disposable kits shipped during the year ended december  management believes the overall increase is primarily due to i the company s increased efforts to promote tmr in international markets  ii medicare reimbursement policies  iii the company s increased base of installed lasers  and iv increased company training programs for physicians throughout total gross profit decreased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with the gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin for the year is primarily due to a non recurring charge of  which the company incurred in the fourth quarter to write down the value of its hl inventory and capital equipment due to the transition to the new hl product 
without this charge  gross margin in would have been of revenues  slightly up from of revenues in as a result of decreased manufacturing overhead expenditures partially offset by lower sales 
of the  charge   was allocated to placement cost of revenues for the write down of the company s installed hl placement laser base to its estimated net realizable value and  was allocated to product cost of revenues for potentially obsolete hl inventory at december  selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with expenses of  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation related expenditures as a result of a reduced headcount throughout when compared to the company has used a portion of the savings from the headcount reduction to increase its sales and marketing initiatives  particularly in the areas of physician training  internet web expansion  and advertising and marketing literature 
research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with expenses of  for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of reduced expenses in monitoring and data collection  project materials and new product development  partially offset by an increase in compensation 
the transition of the next generation co laser from research and development to manufacturing contributed to the decrease in expenditures in this area in other income of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to other income of  for the year ended december  the increase is a result of both higher average invested cash balances and higher rates of interest on invested funds 
there was no provision for income tax for the years ended december  or due to net losses of  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  the higher net loss resulted from lower total revenues and lower gross margins  which is primarily due to a non recurring charge of  which the company incurred in the fourth quarter to writedown the value of its hli inventory and capital equipment due to the transition to the new hl product 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  increased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  the major factors in both increases are primarily due to the periods reflecting increased sales of the hl and related disposables due to the company s receipt of fda approval to market the hl in august  as well as license and royalty fees associated with the cardiogenesis settlement 
placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  increased from placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  in may  the health care financing administration hcfa instituted a non coverage policy for tmr procedures performed on medicare patients in the united states 
the hcfa announcement  coupled with delays in the pma process  caused the company to examine its contractual requirements during and amend substantially all of its retained placement contracts  temporarily replacing contractual minimum billings with actual usage billings 
following approval of the pma by the fda on august   the company renegotiated usage agreements with its customers on a case by case basis 
the period reflects revenues from these retained placement contracts with the renegotiated usage agreements following fda approval 
the period reflects revenues primarily from retained placement contracts with actual usage billings 
for the year ended december   the company shipped  disposable kits  an increase of over the disposable kits shipped during the year ended december  management believes the overall increase is primarily due to marketplace awareness of tmr as an approved procedure subsequent to the august approval by the fda and the company s increased base of installed lasers 
total gross profit increased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with the gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  in the period  the company did not generate sufficient sales volume to efficiently cover manufacturing costs  resulting in lower gross margins 
in  gross margins improved as a result of an increase in sales volumes and manufacturing cost reductions implemented by the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with expenses of  for the year ended december  this reduction is primarily due to a restructuring of the company s workforce in april the periods reflect reduced headcount and compensation and related benefits related to the reduced workforce 
research and development expenditures of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared with expenditures of  for the year ended december  the decreases in compared to reflect the reduced demands for clinical study compilation and data preparation following the fda approval for the hl in august in addition  in april  the company reduced its workforce  and the periods reflect reduced headcount and compensation and related benefits related to the reduced workforce 
other income of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to other income of  for the year ended december   primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances in as compared to there was no provision for income tax for the years ended december  or due to the net losses of  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  the smaller net loss resulted from higher total revenues and higher gross margin dollars coupled with lower overall operating expenses in when compared with liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  over the past three years  the company incurred significant operating losses and utilized significant amounts of cash to fund operations 
during and  the company implemented a number of programs to reduce its consumption of cash  including operating expense reductions and establishment of third party financing alliances to enable the company to monetize certain of its minimum procedure sales contracts 
throughout  the company has been in a critical stage of its development as it continues to transition from a research and development oriented company to a commercial enterprise with complete sales  marketing and production capabilities 
in march  the company closed an equity financing with two institutional investors 
in conjunction with this financing  the company sold  shares of common stock at per share  resulting in proceeds to the company net of all issuance costs of approximately  most recently  in january  the company entered into a strategic marketing alliance and exclusive distribution agreement with edwards to distribute the new hl laser and all disposable tmr kits throughout the united states 
in conjunction with this agreement  the company received a  equity investment through the sale of  newly issued shares of common stock at 
per share and issued warrants to purchase an additional  shares at exercise prices ranging from to 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its existing cash resources  including cash raised in the january sale of common stock to edwards  will meet its working capital requirements through december  however  the company expects that its revenues and gross profit in will likely be lower than corresponding quarters in excluding the impact on gross margin of the non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of as a result of the discounted sale price of lasers and tmr procedural kits when sold to edwards  until such time  if ever  that edwards marketing efforts result in substantially increased tmr procedural volumes and corresponding kit sales 
should tmr procedural volume not increase sufficiently to offset the impact of selling lasers and kits to edwards at a discounted price  the company s liquidity and capital resources will be negatively impacted 
additionally  other unanticipated decreases in operating revenues or increases in expenses  the inability to monetize usage agreements or further delays in third party reimbursement to healthcare providers using the company s products may adversely impact the company s cash position and require further cost reductions or the need to obtain additional financing 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving broad commercial acceptance of the heart laser systems or that the company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis 
the company may need to raise additional capital to fund operations during the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that  should the company require additional financing  such financing will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
should additional financing not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  additional actions may be required that could adversely impact the company s ability to continue to realize assets and satisfy liabilities in the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of these uncertainties 
the company has seen an increasing trend on the part of its hospital customers to acquire the heart laser systems on a usage basis rather than as a capital equipment purchase 
the company believes that this trend is the result of limitations many hospitals currently have on acquiring expensive capital equipment as well as competitive pressures in the marketplace 
this shift to a usage business model may result in the deferral of both revenues and the receipt of cash 
the company s cash position and its need for additional financing to fund operations will be dependent in part upon the number of hospitals that acquire heart laser systems on a usage basis and the number and frequency of tmr procedures performed by these hospitals 
no assurance can be given that a usage based sales model will be successful  whether implemented by the company or edwards 
during the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of  which resulted in the use of approximately  to support operations 
cash used for investing activities was approximately  and related to the company s  cost to manufacture and deploy placement lasers at customer sites and the purchase of  of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  primarily consisting of the net proceeds of  obtained from the sale of the company s common stock 
at december   the company had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income  which expire at various dates through  and the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
in addition  various other deferred tax assets have been generated related primarily to intercompany profit  depreciation  accruals  and research and development tax credits 
because the company believes that  as of december   it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  no tax benefit for prior year losses and other deferred items has been provided 
these amounts could provide a benefit to the company in the future in profitable years  if any  subject to the expirations noted 
risk factors our company has a history of operating losses plc systems inc was founded in we have incurred operating losses in every year of our existence except we have incurred net losses of  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the foreseeable future 
moreover  although our business is not seasonal in nature  our revenues tend to vary significantly from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter 
our company is dependent on one principal product we develop and market one principal product line  which consists of two patented high powered carbon dioxide laser systems known as the heart laser systems and related disposables 
approximately of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december  and in the fiscal year ended december  was derived from the sales and service of our first generation laser and related disposables 
our company may be unable to raise needed funds as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that our existing capital resources  including cash raised in our january sale of common stock to edwards  should be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through december  if our business does not progress in accordance with our current business plan  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may not be able to raise additional capital upon satisfactory terms or at all  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  ownership dilution to our stockholders will result 
in order to compete effectively  our heart laser systems need to gain commercial acceptance the heart laser systems are designed for use in the treatment of coronary artery disease in a surgical laser procedure we pioneered known as transmyocardial revascularization 
transmyocardial revascularization is commonly referred to in our industry as tmr 
tmr is a new technology that is only recently becoming known 
our products may never achieve widespread commercial acceptance 
to be successful  we need to demonstrate to the medical community in general  and to heart surgeons and cardiologists in particular  that tmr procedures and the heart laser systems are effective  relatively safe and cost effective  support third party efforts to document the medical processes by which tmr procedures relieve angina  if any  train heart surgeons to perform tmr procedures using the heart laser systems  and obtain widespread third party reimbursement for the tmr procedure 
to date  we have trained only a limited number of heart surgeons and will need to expand our marketing and training capabilities 
although the heart laser systems have received fda approval and the ce mark  they have not yet received widespread commercial acceptance 
if we are unable to maintain regulatory approvals or to achieve widespread commercial acceptance of the heart laser systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
results of long term clinical studies may adversely affect our business patients have only been treated with the hl since january  and  as a result  there have been few long term follow up studies 
if patients suffer harmful  long term consequences from the heart laser systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by a recent six month clinical study direct  the results of which were released on october  at the transcatheter therapeutics conference 
the direct study  which used a johnson johnson holmium pmr laser  demonstrated no significant differences in the clinical outcomes measured between patients receiving pmr therapy and patients in the control group 
the principal investigator of the direct study concluded that the similar outcomes in patients in the treatment group and patients in the control group suggests a strong placebo effect  as opposed to any real therapeutic benefit from the pmr laser revascularization procedure 
although we believe that there are distinct clinical differences and therapeutic outcomes between a surgical laser tmr procedure and an interventional laser pmr procedure  the negative publicity resulting from the direct study with respect to all laser revascularization procedures  including our co laser tmr approach  makes it more challenging for us to distinguish our surgical tmr from pmr  and our co laser from holmium lasers 
if we are unable to distinguish these procedures and therapies  the heart laser systems may never gain broad commercial acceptance and  therefore  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
rapid technological changes in our industry could make the heart laser systems obsolete our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and intense competition 
new technologies and products and new industry standards will develop at a rapid pace 
they could make the heart laser systems obsolete 
the advent of new devices and procedures and advances in new drugs and genetic engineering are especially threatening 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce product enhancements to address the needs of our customers 
material delays in introducing product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our product and purchase those of our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and are in a better financial position to exploit marketing and research and development opportunities 
our competitors products use different types of lasers than we use in the heart laser systems  including holmium and excimer lasers that may gain more widespread market acceptance than the heart laser systems 
in addition  we believe that several companies are attempting to develop less invasive methods of performing tmr procedures 
these new methods may eliminate the need to make an incision in the patient s chest  reducing costs and speeding recovery 
these new technologies and methods may erode the potential tmr market  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must receive and maintain government approval in order to market our product general the heart laser systems and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive  rigorous and changing federal and state regulation in the united states and to similar regulatory requirements in other major markets  including the european union and japan 
to date  we have received regulatory approval in the united states and have the ability to market the heart laser systems in the european union excluding france 
we have not received regulatory approval in japan 
without regulatory approval  we cannot market the heart laser systems in japan 
even if granted  regulations may significantly restrict the use of the heart laser systems 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approval is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
united states although we have received fda approval  the fda has restricted the use of the heart laser systems and could reverse its approval at any time we received fda approval to market the hl and hl for tmr procedures in august and january  respectively 
however  the fda has not allowed us to market the heart laser systems to treat patients whose condition is amenable to conventional treatments  such as heart bypass surgery and angioplasty  and could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser systems at any time 
europe although we have the ability to market our product in the european union  individual members of the european union could  and france has  prohibited commercial use of the heart laser systems we received the ce mark from the european union for the hl and hl in march and march  respectively 
however the european union could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser systems at any time  we cannot market the heart laser systems in france  and other european union countries could prohibit or restrict use of the heart laser systems 
the french ministry of health instituted a commercial moratorium on tmr procedures in october in its opinion  the procedure is considered to be experimental and should only be performed within the context of a clinical study 
an evaluation of the safety of the hl has been currently under review by a panel of french experts 
there can be no assurance that this moratorium will be lifted on a timely basis or at all 
asia we cannot market our product in major asian markets until we receive government approval we believe that japan represents the largest potential market for the heart laser systems in asia 
prior to marketing the heart laser systems in japan  we must receive approval from the japanese government 
this approval requires a clinical study in japan with at least patients 
a study was completed in with the hl although the results of this study have been submitted to the japanese government  we do not know whether the clinical study will be sufficient or when  if ever  we will receive approval to sell the hl in japan 
we could incur substantial costs defending against possible legal claims in the future we have been sued for alleged securities law violations in the past  and may be subject to similar claims or other claims in the future 
between august and november  we were named as defendant in class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws because we failed to obtain a favorable fda panel recommendation to market the hl nineteen of the claims were consolidated into a single action and some of the claims were dismissed in all remaining claims were settled in february the settlement of these claims did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  any future litigation or claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success 
asserting and defending intellectual property rights may impact our results of operations in our industry  competitors often assert intellectual property infringement claims against one another 
the success of our business depends on our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property 
future litigation may have a material impact on our financial condition even if we are successful in marketing the heart laser systems 
we may not be successful in defending or asserting our intellectual property rights 
an adverse outcome in any litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties 
in addition  a finding that any of our intellectual property is invalid could allow our competitors to more easily and cost effectively compete with us 
thus  an unfavorable outcome in any patent litigation or interference proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or interference proceeding could be substantial 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or interference proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and interference proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages we may be subject to product liability claims 
the united states supreme court has stated that compliance with fda regulations will not shield a company from common law negligent design claims or manufacturing and labeling claims based on state rules 
such claims may absorb significant management time and could degrade the reputation of plc and the marketability of the heart laser systems 
if product liability claims are made with respect to our products  we may need to recall the implicated product which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although we maintain product liability insurance with a per claim and yearly aggregate maximum of million  subject to a  per occurrence and  aggregate self insured deductible  we cannot be sure that our insurance will be adequate to cover potential product liability lawsuits 
our insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims exceeded our insurance coverage  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on certain suppliers some of the components for our laser systems  most notably the power supply  ecg card and certain optics and fabricated parts  are only available from one supplier 
we have no assurance that we will ever be able to source some or all of our sole sourced components from more than one supplier 
any interruption in supply from these suppliers could prevent us from meeting commercial demands for the heart laser systems  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have limited manufacturing experience building the hl we have only recently begun to manufacture the hl the hl is based on a different design than the hl in order to achieve certain manufacturing cost savings  we have taken a more vertically integrated approach to the manufacture of the hl than we did with the hl as a result  we may experience manufacturing difficulties  including but not limited to shortages in component parts due to supplier manufacturing or procurement delays  lack of experienced technical personnel  production yields  and changing processes and controls over the manufacturing procedures employed 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations a portion of our product sales are generated from operations outside of the united states 
establishing and expanding international sales can be expensive 
managing and overseeing foreign operations may be difficult and products may not receive market acceptance 
risks of doing business outside the us include the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  us export licenses may be difficult to obtain  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
there can be no assurance that our international business will grow or that any of the foregoing risks will not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
because we are incorporated in canada  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us and our canadian directors under canadian law  you may not be able to enforce a judgment issued by courts in the united states against us or our canadian directors 
the status of the law in canada is unclear as to whether a us citizen can enforce a judgment from a us court in canada for violations of us securities laws 
a separate suit may need to be brought directly in canada 
antitakeover provisions may prevent you from realizing a premium return provisions of canadian law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to you 
specifically  canadian law requires any person who makes a tender offer that would increase the person s stock ownership to more than of our outstanding common stock to make a tender offer for all of our common stock 
these provisions could prevent you from realizing the premium return that stockholders may realize in conjunction with corporate takeovers 
in addition  we have three classes of directors  with approximately one third elected each year for a three year term 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate takeover or a change in our management 
this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our stock may fall if other shareholders sell their stock certain current shareholders hold large amounts of our restricted stock  which they will be able to sell in the public market in the near future 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock within a short period of time could cause our stock price to fall 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock 
the value of your common stock may decrease if other security holders exercise their options and warrants as shown in the table below  as of december  we have reserved an additional  shares of common stock for future issuance upon exercise of outstanding options and redeemable warrants 
weighted average range of exercise exercise shares reserved for conversion prices conversion price future issuance options 
 redeemable warrants  employee stock purchase plan 

 total  we may issue additional options and warrants in the future 
if any of these securities are exercised  you may experience significant dilution in the market value of your common stock 
in january  we issued additional warrants and adjusted the purchase price for certain outstanding warrants 
we have no intention to pay dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings  if any  for use in our business and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements this annual report and information incorporated by reference contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements deal with our current plans and expectations and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s operations consists of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products exclusively in the united states and sells the products in the united states and abroad 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  especially the swiss franc and the german mark 
when the us dollar strengthens against the franc or mark  the value of nonfunctional currency sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of sales increases 
in the past  the company s support of its foreign operations has benefited from a stronger us dollar  but has been adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
no assurance can be given that foreign currency fluctuations in the future may not adversely affect the company s business financial condition and results of operations  although at the present the company does not believe that its exposure is significant 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities
