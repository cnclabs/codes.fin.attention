the series d convertible preferred stock pays dividends at a rate of per annum  has a liquidation preference of per share and is convertible into common stock at the rate of per share 
we can cause the series d convertible preferred stock to convert after october   if our common stock has traded at a price greater than per share for twenty consecutive trading days 
in connection with the issuance of the series d convertible preferred stock  we issued  warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share of common stock

we have a deferred tax asset of million  which is reserved against by a valuation allowance of million  for a net deferred tax asset of million 
management expects that we will generate million of taxable income within the next years to utilize a minimum of million of the net deferred tax asset 
the taxable income will be generated through a combination of improved operating results and tax planning strategies 
rather than lose the tax benefit  we could implement certain tax planning strategies including the sale of certain of our operating assets  including certain mall locations  the proceeds of which sales we would expect to use for additional street stores 
based on the expected operating improvements combined with tax planning strategies in place  management believes that adequate taxable income will be generated over the next years in which to utilize the tax benefit 
since fiscal  our retail store operating strategy has focused on opening and operating new retail stores at street locations  while closing less profitable retail stores at mall locations 
we closed nine mall stores and opened eight street location stores in fiscal in fiscal  we opened thirteen street store locations and closed one mall store 
in fiscal  we closed two mall stores and opened street store locations 
we will make capital expenditures during the upcoming fiscal year primarily in order to continue our plan of opening street location stores 
we plan to expend approximately  on fixed assets   on pre opening expenses and  net of payables  on inventory for each new store we open 
our ability to fund our operations  open new stores and maintain compliance with our credit facility is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and secure other financing such as capital leases 
we reported operating losses related to retail store operations for fiscal of million  for fiscal of million and for fiscal of million 
during an economic downturn we expect to see reduced sales at our existing stores with our mall stores experiencing the largest impact 
as a result  the rate at which we can execute our growth plan will depend on the extent to which we can improve operating results in the existing retail environment and bring our new stores up to expected sales rates 
we continually look for ways to increase inventory turnover  obtain better payment terms from suppliers and otherwise improve our operations that are aimed at accomplishing these goals 
we also continually consider our financing alternatives and monitor the success of our efforts to improve operating results in determining the rate at which we execute our growth strategy 
we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
if  however  we were to pursue our growth strategy too aggressively  experience a significant decrease in cash flow from operations or be unable to obtain expected capital lease financings  we may be required to obtain additional financing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of operations  we face no significant market risk 
our purchase of imported products subjects us to a minimal amount of foreign currency risk 
foreign currency risk is that risk associated with recurring transactions with foreign companies  such as purchases of goods from foreign vendors 
if the strength of foreign currencies increases compared to the united states dollar  the price of imported products could increase 
we have no commitments  however  for future purchases with foreign vendors and  additionally  we have the ability to source products domestically in the event of import price increases
