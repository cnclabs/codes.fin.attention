year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease in consulting services revenues and a decrease in other revenues 
other revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to decreased hardware sales and reduced software revenues 
ciber operations revenues decreased while digiterra revenues decreased  when compared to last year 
ciber operations accounted for approximately of revenues in and digiterra revenues decreased to approximately of revenues for the year ended december  from in our other businesses accounted for approximately of revenues for the year ended december  compared to less than in the majority of revenues from our other businesses in came from waterstone and solution partners  which we acquired late in  and therefore included revenue for fewer than months 
during  there continued to be an industry wide shift in it spending  principally resulting from the resolution of the yk issue and erp curtailments 
many companies reduced it expenditures beginning mid due to completion of yk and erp specific projects and a general tendency to minimize new it initiatives during the end of this adversely impacted us  particularly in our mainframe staffing and erp related service offerings 
there was a significant industry trend towards new it services driven by the internet and increased bandwidth availability 
these new services include web designed  e business technologies  customer relationship management crm and supply chain software  wireless integration  among others 
we have focused more of our efforts to deliver these newer it services 
these efforts include new alliances with independent software vendors  such as commerce one and siebel  and the realignment of our professional and sales personnel towards a greater focus on new technology services 
in addition  commencing in the spring of  the it services industry was negatively impacted by the shift in investor sentiment away from development and early stage dot 
com businesses 
as a result  industry demand for it services by dot 
com companies decreased significantly 
this has lead to greater competition within the it services industry 
gross margin percentage decreased to of revenues for the year ended december  from of revenues for the year ended december  this decrease is due to declining gross margins on consulting services offset partially by improved gross margins on other revenues 
consulting services gross margins declined primarily due to a decrease in the utilization levels of professional staff 
ciber operations gross margin on consulting services declined to for the year ended december  from in  while digiterra consulting gross margin declined to in from in gross margin percentage on other revenues increased due to decreased sales of lower margin computer hardware products 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in  while as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for the year ended december  from in this reflects the semi fixed nature of sg a 
we also incurred additional sg a in related to new marketing and branding initiatives as well as costs to prepare digiterra to be a stand alone entity 
as our focus continues to shift to more solutions oriented and project work  sg a is expected to increase as a percentage of sales and partially offset the expected higher gross margins on such work 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the additional intangible assets resulting from acquisitions during the past year  partially offset by the effects of the goodwill write down in the september quarter 
goodwill impairment and other charges of million were incurred during the year ended december  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the quarter ended september  to write down the goodwill associated with certain acquisitions 
this charge represents the amount required to write down the goodwill to our best estimate of the future discounted cash flows of these operations 
the other charges are comprised of million of severance costs resulting from involuntary terminations related to personnel realignment   for an asset write down  and  of professional fees resulting from our planned spinoff of digiterra 
subject to board approval and a favorable tax ruling from the irs  as well as favorable market conditions  we expect to complete the spinoff of digiterra to our shareholders in we also expect to incur additional costs in in connection with our plan to spinoff digiterra 
net other income  including interest income and interest expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other income in includes gains of  from sales of investments and other income in includes a gain of  on the sale of our logisticspro software business 
the fluctuations in interest income and expense are the result of changes in our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed under our line of credit 
tax expense of million was recorded during the year ended december  even though a pre tax loss was reported 
tax expense was recorded for the year ended december  because most of the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for income tax purposes since the majority of the impaired goodwill related to non taxable acquisitions 
excluding the effects of the goodwill impairment charge  our effective tax rate would have been approximately in as compared to for the year ended december  tax expense for also reflects the effects of increased non deductible goodwill amortization  increased other non deductible expenses and increased state income taxes 
six months ended december  as compared to six months ended december  our total revenues increased to million for the six months ended december  from million for the six months ended december  this represents a increase in consulting services revenues offset by a decrease in other revenues  primarily sales of computer hardware products 
other revenues decreased to million for the six months ended december  from million for the same period of of the increase in consulting services revenues  approximately was due to revenues from acquired businesses and approximately was due to organic growth of existing operations

selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for the six months ended december  compared to of revenues for the same period of this increase was due primarily to additional costs incurred for new programs implemented to position us for future growth  including the addition of senior and executive management team members  branding and marketing initiatives  and internal systems development

no other charges were incurred during the six months ended december   while merger costs of million  primarily transaction related broker and professional costs related to pooling of interests business combinations  were incurred during the six months ended december  interest income decreased to  for the six months ended december  from million for the same period of due to decreased average cash balances available for investment 
interest expense was  for the six months ended december   while no interest expense was incurred during the same period of this increase was due to borrowings under our line of credit during the six months ended december  included in other income for the six months ended december  is an  gain on the sale of our logisticspro software business 
our effective tax rate for the six months ended december  was compared to for the same period of our effective tax rate for the six months ended december  increased due to increased nondeductible amortization resulting from certain acquisitions 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this represents a increase in consulting revenues offset by a decrease in other revenues  primarily sales of computer hardware products 
other revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in consulting revenues was derived primarily from an increase in hours billed and  to a lesser extent  an increase in average billing rates 
of the increase in consulting revenues for fiscal in comparison to fiscal  approximately was due to revenues from acquired businesses or immaterial poolings of interests and approximately was due to organic growth of existing operations 
organic growth for fiscal was driven by a strong demand for erp implementation services and was lessened  to some extent  due to declining direct year service revenues 
ciber operations consulting revenues increased  while digiterra consulting revenues increased 
digiterra consulting revenues increased to approximately of total consulting revenues in fiscal from in gross margin percentage improved to of revenues in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement was due to improved gross margins on both consulting services and other revenues 
gross margins on consulting services increased as a larger percentage of our revenues were derived from higher margin solutions oriented and project work 
digiterra consulting margins improved to in fiscal from in  which was offset somewhat by a decline in ciber operations consulting margin to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for fiscal compared to of revenues for fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to greater economies of scale  including reduced administrative costs of certain merged companies 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due to the additional amortization of intangible assets resulting from mergers and acquisitions 
other charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal represent merger costs  which are primarily transaction related broker and professional costs resulting from pooling of interests business combinations 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased average cash balances available for investment and the elimination of borrowings of certain merged companies 
including the effects of pro forma adjustments to income tax expense  if any  our effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased due to reduced nondeductible merger costs in fiscal compared to fiscal  which was partially offset by increased nondeductible amortization resulting from fiscal acquisitions 
the pro forma adjustment to income tax expense in fiscal reflects the exclusion of the one time income tax effects related to changes in the tax status of certain merged companies and imputes income tax expense for s corporation operations that were not subject to income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our operating cash flow and our available line of credit will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
as of december   we have purchased  shares for  under this program 
we may use significant amounts of cash for the repurchase of our stock or to acquire other businesses 
as a result  we may borrow to finance such activities 
future borrowings may include bank  private or public debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  million for the six months ended december   and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in primarily reflects reduced income  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge 
accounts receivable totaled million at december  compared to million at december  accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso was days at december  net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  million for the six months ended december   and million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we used cash for acquisitions of  and million during fiscal and  respectively  million during the six months ended december   and million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we received million from agilera as repayment of advances 
we purchased property and equipment of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  million during the six months ended december   and million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment have decreased in because we made a number of significant purchases in related to back office systems  technology infrastructure and facility expansion 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  million in the six months ended december   and million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we obtained net cash proceeds from employee stock purchases and options exercised of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  million in the six months ended december   and million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we purchased  shares of treasury stock for million during fiscal   shares for million during the six months ended december    shares for million and  shares for million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have reissued some of the treasury shares under our stock plans and in connection with acquisitions 
we have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this bank line of credit at december  and june  at december   there was  outstanding under this line of credit 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the credit agreement requires a commitment fee of per annum on any unused portion of the line of credit up to million 
the credit agreement expires on july  we expect  although there can be no assurance  to be able to renew this line of credit on similar terms 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
typically  operating income as a percentage of revenues is lowest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year because more holidays and vacations are taken at that time of year resulting in fewer hours billed in that period 
factors that may affect future results included in this report and elsewhere from time to time in other written reports and oral statements  including but not limited to  the annual report to shareholders  quarterly shareholder letters  news releases and investor presentations  are forward looking statements about our business strategies  market potential  future financial performance and other matters which reflect our current expectations 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly such forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  those set forth below 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
growth through business combinations and internal expansion as an integral part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to expand by acquiring information technology businesses 
we regularly evaluate potential business combinations and aggressively pursue attractive transactions 
from july  through december   we completed business combinations 
the success of this strategy depends not only upon our ability to identify and acquire businesses on a cost effective basis  but also upon our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business with our organization and culture 
business combinations involve numerous risks  including the ability to manage geographically remote operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of losing clients and employees of the acquired business and the risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience 
there can be no assurance we will be able to acquire additional business  or that any business combination will result in benefits to us 
in addition  we may open new offices in attractive markets with our own personnel 
many of our branch offices were originally start up operations 
not all branch offices  whether start up or acquired  have been successful 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully start up  identify  acquire  or integrate future successful branch office operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified consultants our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain adequately trained personnel who can address the changing and increasingly sophisticated technology needs of our clients 
our ongoing personnel needs arise from turnover  which is generally high in the industry  and client needs for consultants trained in the newest software and hardware technologies 
few of our employees are bound by non compete agreements 
competition for personnel in the information technology services industry is significant 
we have had  and expect to continue to have  difficulty in attracting and retaining an optimal level of qualified consultants 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully 
dependence on significant relationships and the absence of long term contracts our five largest clients accounted for of our revenues in with our largest client accounting for of revenues 
we strive to develop long term relationships with our clients 
most individual client assignments are from three to months  however  many of our client relationships have continued for many years 
although they may be subject to penalty provisions  clients may generally cancel a contract at any time 
in addition  under many contracts  clients may reduce their use of our services under such contract without penalty 
if any significant client terminates its relationship with us or substantially decreases its use of our services  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  we have a significant relationship with peoplesoft as an implementation partner 
approximately of our revenues are from services related to peoplesoft software 
in the event peoplesoft products become obsolete or non competitive  or if we should lose our implementation partner status with peoplesoft  we could suffer a material adverse effect 
we have other similar relationships and strategic alliances with other technology vendors 
the sudden loss of any significant relationship or substantial decline in demand for their products could also adversely affect us 
management of a rapidly changing business our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  such as the evolution of the internet  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
if we cannot keep pace with these changes  our business could suffer 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop service offerings that keep pace with continuing changes in technology  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
our success will also depend on our ability to develop and implement ideas for the successful application of existing and new technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis or our ideas may not be successful in the marketplace 
products and technologies developed by our competitors may also make our services or product offerings less competitive or obsolete 
project risks we provide and intend to continue to provide project services to our clients 
projects are distinguishable from ciber s professional services staff supplementation contracts by the level of responsibility we assume 
with professional services staff supplementation contracts  our clients generally maintain responsibility for the overall tasks 
in a typical project  we assume major responsibilities for the management of the project and or the design and implementation of specific deliverables based upon client defined requirements 
as our project engagements become larger and more complex and must be completed in shorter time frames  it becomes more difficult to manage the project and the likelihood of any mistake increases 
in addition  our projects often involve applications that are critical to our client s business 
our failure to timely and successfully complete a project and meet our client s expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such adverse effects may include delayed or lost revenues  additional services being provided at no charge and a negative impact to our reputation 
in addition  claims for damages may be brought against us  regardless of our responsibility  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims 
our contracts generally limit our liability for damages that may arise in rendering our services 
however  we cannot be sure these contractual provisions will successfully protect us from liability if we are sued 
we sometimes undertake projects on a fixed fee basis or cap the amount of fees we may bill on a time and materials basis 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays could make such projects less profitable or unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we believe that we currently compete principally with it and internet professional services firms  technology vendors and internal information systems groups 
many of the companies that provide services in our markets have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced  and expect to continue to face  competition from new entrants into our markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
internet growth and usage our business is dependent upon continued growth of the use of the internet by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers 
if internet usage and commerce conducted over the internet does not continue to grow  the demand for our services may decrease and  as a result  our revenues would decline 
capacity constraints of the internet  unless resolved  could impede further growth of internet usage 
in addition  any laws and regulations relating to the internet that are adopted by governments in the united states or abroad that could reduce growth or usage of the internet as a commercial medium may impact our business 
we cannot predict how any such government regulations may affect our business 
however  if such regulations were to result in a decrease in the demand for our services  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
international expansion we expect to expand our international operations 
we currently have offices in toronto and vancouver  canada and eindhoven  the netherlands 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and providing our services internationally 
international operations are subject to political and economic uncertainties  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and new tax and legal requirements 
other risks inherent in international operations include managing geographically distant locations and customers  employees speaking different languages and different cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
if any of these risks materialize  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our quarterly revenues or operating results generally include costs relating to the expansion of our business  the extent and timing of business acquisitions  our ability to obtain new and follow up on client engagements  the timing of assignments from customers  our consultant utilization rate including our ability to transition employees quickly from completed assignments to new engagements  the seasonal nature of our business due to variations in holidays and vacation schedules  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors  price competition or price changes and our ability to manage costs and economic and financial conditions specific to our clients 
quarterly sales and operating results can be difficult to forecast  even in the short term 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our revenues or operating results in one or more future quarters will fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts or investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
price volatility the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts expectations  general economic  financial and other factors  and market conditions that can affect the capital markets 
in addition  reaction to announcements made by us or by our competitors  such as new contracts or service offerings  acquisitions or strategic investments may impact our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates on any borrowings we may have 
we currently do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
foreign exchange 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
during the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues was attributable to foreign operations 
ciber does not enter into forward exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign currency exchange risk on transactions denominated in foreign currencies or for speculative or trading purposes 
we believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk at december  is not material 
interest rates 
we have a million revolving line of credit with a bank 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this bank line of credit at december  the interest rate on the line of credit is based on libor  plus 
therefore  as libor fluctuates  we would experience changes in interest expense related to any outstanding borrowings
