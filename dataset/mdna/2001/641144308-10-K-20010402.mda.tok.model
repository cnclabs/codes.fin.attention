in the first six months of  revenues  primarily from the wall data and ftp products fell short of the level of revenues anticipated prior to the acquisitions 
in management s judgment  this short fall in the level of revenue was not a temporary condition 
as a result  the company revisited its strategy to refocus itself on core competencies  revised its business plan  and its projected future revenues for each family of products 
management believed it was necessary to restructure the company and reduce operating expenses in line with the revised anticipated level of revenues  which were expected to be less than or comparable to revenues generated during the first half of fiscal as a result  the company announced a restructuring on august  as part of the restructuring  the company reduced its workforce by approximately  consisting mostly of engineering and customer support personnel who were focussed primarily on the company s older technologies  acquired through the wall data and ftp acquisitions

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in detail below  under the heading factors that may affect future results and financial condition  acquisitions involve a number of risks  including risks relating to the integration of the acquired company s operations  personnel  and products 
there can be no assurance that the integration of previously acquired companies  or the integration of any future acquisition s  will be accomplished successfully  and the failure to accomplish effectively any of these integration s could have a material adverse effect on netmanage s results of operations and financial condition

products included supportnow enterprise and supportnow sdk real time software tools that help reduce the length of support phone calls from end users and augment application help and training 
for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  the company experienced an increase in net revenues and  an increase in net loss 
the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance revenues as a result of the inclusion of revenues from the recent acquisitions of wall data  simware  and aqueduct 
the company continues to experience pricing pressures on its products 
there can be no assurance that revenues will increase at the same rate  or at all  in future periods 
see factors that may affect future results and financial condition marketing and distribution below 
because the company generally ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any one quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s operating expense levels are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
operating expenses  excluding the write off of in process research and development  amortization and impairment of goodwill and restructuring charges  have increased in absolute dollars and have fluctuated as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of the inclusion of the operations of wall data  simware  and aqueduct 
operating expenses are expected to increase as a result of the acquisitions of wall data  simware and aqueduct but may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues as the company completes its integration of wall data  simware  and aqueduct into its operations and develops and introduces new products which may contribute more significantly to revenue 
while the company continues to adjust its operations to address these issues  there can be no assurance that net revenues or net income will stabilize or improve in the future

service revenues have been primarily attributable to maintenance agreements associated with product licenses 
license fees remained relatively flat in absolute dollars and decreased substantially as a percentage of total net revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  license fees in include a full year s license fee revenue for wall data and simware versus the inclusion of two months of simware s revenues and one month of wall data s revenues in license fees in reflect the replacement of historical product revenue with products from the acquired companies 
the increase in service revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to primarily reflects the addition of existing customer base as a result of the wall data and simware acquisitions 
the company has operations worldwide with sales offices located in the united states  europe  canada  latin america  israel  and japan 
international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were approximately and  respectively  for the years ended december  and international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were relatively unchanged due to the integration of ftp products  particularly in europe  with the company s product lines in the international marketplace  and to a lesser extent  the inclusion of results from the recent acquisitions of wall data and simware offset by declines in sales of the company s other international product offerings 
the company is currently in the process of integrating the sales and distribution efforts of these recent acquisitions 
software license fees are generally recognized as revenue upon shipment if the fee is considered fixed and determinable  the arrangement does not include significant customization of the software  and collectibility is probable 
allowances for returns and doubtful accounts are provided based on historical rates of returns and write offs 
certain of the company s sales to distributors are under agreements providing rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
accordingly  the company defers recognition of such sales until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
the company provides ongoing maintenance and support to its customers  generally under annual service agreements 
maintenance and support is comprised of software updates for existing products and telephone support 
service revenues are recognized on a pro rata basis over the terms of such agreements 
the company provides training and consulting services to its customers 
revenue from such services is recognized as the related services are performed and has not been material to date 
the company expects that revenues generated from such training and consulting services will increase in the future 
no customer accounted for more than of net revenues during the years ended december  and gross margin cost of revenues primarily includes royalties paid to third parties for licensed software incorporated into the company s products  costs associated with product packaging  documentation and software duplication  and the amortization and write down of purchased software 
gross margin  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  increased between the years ended december  and primarily as a result of the change in the mix of products sold and the shift of the company s revenue from product to service revenue 
cost of service revenues through december  and have not been material and are not reported separately 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate in the future due to increased price competition  the mix of distribution channels used by the company  the mix of license fee revenues versus service revenues  the mix of products sold  and the mix of international versus domestic revenues 
the company typically recognizes higher gross margins on direct sales than on sales through indirect channels of distribution  which carry lower margins 
in  products acquired with wall data  which are sold through lower margin indirect channels  were included in the company s results for the entire year 
research and development research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  occupancy and travel expenses  and fees paid to outside consultants 
r d expenses  in absolute dollars  have increased for as compared to  primarily as a result of increased headcount from the acquisitions of wall data and simware in the fourth quarter of the company expects that r d spending in absolute dollars will increase in but  as a percentage of revenues  will fluctuate depending on future revenue levels  acquisitions and licensing of technology 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  under which the company is required to capitalize software development costs after technological feasibility is established  which the company defines as a working model and further defines as a beta version of the software 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future gross product revenue  estimated economic life and changes in technology 
costs that do not qualify for capitalization are charged to r d expense when incurred 
sales and marketing sales and marketing s m expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions of sales and marketing personnel  consulting personnel  advertising and promotional expenses  customer service and support costs 
s m expenses increased in absolute dollars during as compared to primarily due to increased headcount as a result of the of wall data and simware acquisitions in the fourth quarter of the company expects that s m expenses during  as a percentage of total net revenues  will fluctuate depending on future revenue levels

write off of in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of aqueduct in the second quarter of  the company allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisitions of wall data and simware in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired total intangible assets and purchased technology of million 
of this amount  million was reflected as a charge to operations in the fourth quarter of  for the write off of in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility  and in management s opinion  had no probable alternative future use 
the company allocates values to in process research and development based on an assessment of research and development projects 
the values assigned to those assets are limited to significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on the risk adjusted cash flow of incomplete projects 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet the company s design requirements  including functions  features  and technical and economic performance requirements 
for a further discussion of write off of in process research and development as it relates to the company s acquisitions  see note of the accompanying notes to the company s consolidated financial statements

in connection with this plan  the company recorded a million charge to operating expenses in the restructuring charge included approximately million of estimated expenses for facilities related charges associated with the consolidation of redundant operations  the write off of excess equipment  leasehold improvements as facilities are downsized or closed  million of employee related expenses for employee terminations  and  in accounting and legal fees related to the acquisitions 
goodwill impairment in connection with the restructuring announced on august  see overview section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and of the accompanying notes to the company s consolidated financial statement  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of all assets of ftp and wall data 
the company evaluated possible impairment of long lived assets using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management evaluated the fair value of its long lived assets and intangibles using primarily the estimated discounted future cash flows method 
management used the same methodology to evaluate the fair value of its long lived assets and intangibles to allocate purchase price at the time of acquisition 
management concluded from the results of this evaluation that a significant  permanent impairment of goodwill and other intangibles had occurred 
as a consequence  the company wrote off million of goodwill and other intangibles through a charge to operations in august amortization of goodwill goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the estimated fair value of its net identifiable assets 
goodwill is amortized over its estimated useful life of five to seven years 
amortization of goodwill increased in compared to  primarily because was the first full year of amortization of the goodwill arising from the acquisitions of wall data and simware in the fourth quarter of the company expects amortization of goodwill to decrease next year as a result of the goodwill impairment charge of million taken in the third quarter of  and the goodwill and intangible assets adjustment to reverse million of overestimated liabilities assumed in the ftp  and wall data acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of interest income and other  net the decrease in interest income and other  net for as compared to  is primarily the result of a net decrease in cash balances and investments as a result of the acquisition of wall data and simware in the fourth quarter of gain on investment  net on december   servicesoft  inc was acquired by broadbase  inc  a company publicly traded on nasdaq 
the company recognized approximately million gain on its investment in servicesoft and classified the broadbase shares in the available for sale securities 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of approximately million  which consisted primarily of foreign income taxes 
at december   the company had a gross deferred tax asset of approximately million 
realization of the gross deferred tax asset is dependent on the company generating sufficient future taxable income 
currently  management believes that it is likely the gross deferred tax asset may not be realized and  therefore  has fully reserved the gross deferred tax asset 
the amount of the gross deferred tax asset  however  could be adjusted in the near term if actual future taxable income differs from estimated amounts

cumulatively  as of december   the company has purchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share for a total cost of approximately million 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition significant fluctuations in operating results the company has experienced  and expects to experience in future periods  significant fluctuations in operating results that may be caused by many factors including  among others  general economic conditions  in particular the recent slowdown of purchases of information technology due to current economic conditions in north america  demand for the company s products  introduction or enhancements of products by the company or its competitors  technological changes in computer networking  competitive pricing pressures  market acceptance of new products  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements  the size and timing of individual product orders  mix of international and domestic revenues  mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  impact of  or failure to enter into  strategic alliances to promote the company s products  quality control of products  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes and foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the company s acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies may cause fluctuations in operating results due to in process research and development charges  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  and integration costs such as those recorded in connection with the acquisitions of ftp  wall data  simware  and aqueduct 
because the company generally ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any one quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter and particularly in the last month of that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s operating results and on the company s ability to achieve profitability 
based on the foregoing  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
restructuring  integration of operations of wall data  simware and aqueduct in early december  following its acquisition of wall data and simware  the company initiated a plan to restructure its worldwide operations in connection with the need to integrate the operations of wall data and simware 
the company undertook a further restructuring of its operations  primarily in north america in august the restructuring related primarily to former wall data operations 
both restructuring plans involved reductions in the company s worldwide workforce and the consolidation of certain of the company s sales  customer support  and research and development facilities 
no assurance can be given that these restructurings will prove to be successful  that future operating results will improve  or that the completion of the restructurings will not disrupt the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we cannot assure you that additional reorganizations of the company s operations will not be required in the future 
the successful combination of companies requires coordination of sales and marketing with research and development efforts  and may be difficult to accomplish 
the integration of both wall data and simware has involved geographically separated organizations in suburban kirkland  washington  boston  massachusetts  cupertino and irvine  california  ottawa  ontario  canada  and haifa  israel  and personnel with diverse business backgrounds and corporate cultures 
the company believes that factors such as the ongoing attention and dedication of management  resources required to effect the complete integration of both wall data and simware  resulting from the announcement and consummation of the acquisition  and the consequent disruption in the business of these companies  have contributed to interruptions and loss of momentum in their business activities 
the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues from the sale of products from wall data and simware on an ongoing basis will depend in part on its ability to effectively respond to these factors 
risks of acquisitions the company s merger and acquisition transactions  including the acquisitions of wall data and simware in the fourth quarter of  and the acquisition of aqueduct in the second quarter of  have been motivated by various factors  including the desire to obtain new technologies  expand and enhance the company s product offerings  expand the company s customer base  attract key personnel  and strengthen the company s presence in the international and oem marketplaces 
product and technology acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the diversion of management s attention away from day to day operations  difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and personnel such as sales  engineering  and customer support  the integration of acquired products with existing product lines  the failure to realize anticipated benefits in terms of cost savings and synergies  undisclosed liabilities  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the potential loss of key employees from acquired companies  and the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
the company regularly evaluates product and technology acquisition opportunities and anticipates that it may make additional acquisitions in the future if it determines that an acquisition would further its corporate strategy 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by the company will or will not occur  that if an acquisition does occur  that it will not materially and adversely affect the company  or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing the company s business 
if the operations of an acquired company or business do not meet the company s expectations  the company may be required to restructure the acquired business  or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business as the company did in the third quarter of changes in personnel the majority of the company s employee workforce is located in the extremely competitive employment markets of silicon valley and orange county in california  the suburban boston area  the suburban seattle area  ottawa  ontario  canada  and haifa  israel 
since the latter half of  the company and  prior to their acquisitions  both ftp and wall data experienced high attrition at all levels and across all functions of the company 
the attrition experienced by the company was attributable to various factors including  among others  industry wide demand exceeding supply for experienced engineering and sales professionals  the effects of the company s restructurings and acquisitions and the company s results of operations 
managing employee attrition  integrating acquired operations and products  and expanding both the geographic areas of its customer base and operations have resulted in substantial demands on the company s management resources  increased the difficulty of hiring  training  and assimilating new employees 
any failure of the company to retain and attract qualified employees or to train or manage its management and employee base could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
product development and competition the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customers needs and frequent new product introductions 
from time to time over the past three years  many customers have delayed purchase decisions due to the confusion in the marketplace relating to rapidly changing technology and product introductions 
to maintain or improve its position in this industry  the company must successfully develop  introduce  and market new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company has experienced difficulty from time to time in developing and introducing new products and enhancing existing products  in a manner which satisfies customer requirements and changing market demands 
any further failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the failure to develop on a timely basis products or product enhancements incorporating new functionality could cause customers to delay purchase of the company s current products or cause customers to purchase products from the company s competitors  either situation would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis  or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
because certain of the company s products incorporate software and other technologies developed and maintained by third parties  the company is  to a certain extent  dependent upon such third parties ability to enhance their current products  to develop new products that will meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis  and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party technologies currently offered in conjunction with its products if those technologies become unavailable to it or obsolete or incompatible with future versions of the company s products or market standards 
for example  substantially all of netmanage s net revenues have been derived from the sales of products that provide internetworking applications for the microsoft windows environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of certain of the company s products might be negatively impacted by developments adverse to microsoft s windows products 
in addition  the company s strategy of developing products based on the windows operating environment is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre release access to  and to develop expertise in  current and future windows developments by microsoft 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to provide on a timely basis products compatible with future windows releases 
the company s ability to internally develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
see changes in personnel above 
in addition to internal development of new products and technologies  the future success of the company may depend on the ability of the company to enter into and implement strategic alliances and oem relationships to develop necessary products or technologies  to expand the company s distribution channels or to jointly market or gain market awareness for the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying or developing such alliances and relationships or that such alliances and relationships will achieve their intended purposes 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products or product enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments  which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
such loss or delay could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s connectivity software products compete with major computer and communication systems vendors  including microsoft  ibm  novell and sun microsystems  inc  as well as smaller networking software companies such as hummingbird communications ltd 
the company also faces competition from makers of terminal emulation software such as attachmate corporation  and wrq  inc 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name or product recognition and a larger customer base  than the company 
the market for the company s products is characterized by significant price competition and the company anticipates that it will face increasing pricing pressures from its current and new competitors in the future 
moreover  given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change  the company believes that competition will persist and intensify in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide new products that compare favorably with the new products of the company s competitors or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices 
the company has experienced price declines for its products since any further material reduction in the prices of the company s products would require the company to increase unit sales in order to maintain revenues at existing levels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the company s competitors could seek to expand their product offerings by designing and selling products using technology that could render obsolete or adversely affect sales of the company s products 
these developments may adversely affect the company s sales of its own products either by directly affecting customer purchasing decisions or by causing potential customers to delay their purchases of the company s products 
several of the company s competitors have developed proprietary networking applications and certain of such vendors  including novell  provide a tcp ip protocol suite in their products at little or no additional cost 
in particular  microsoft has embedded a tcp ip protocol suite in its windows  windows  windows  windows me  and windows nt operating systems 
the company has products which are similar to connectivity products marketed by microsoft 
microsoft is expected to increase development of such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
marketing and distribution historically  the company has relied significantly on its independent distributors  systems integrators and value added resellers for certain elements of the marketing and distribution of its products 
the agreements in place with these organizations are generally non exclusive 
these organizations are not within the control of the company  may represent other product lines in addition to those of the company and are not obligated to purchase products from the company 
there can be no assurance that such organizations will give a high priority to the marketing of the company s products  and such organizations may give a higher priority to other products  which may include those of the company s competitors 
actions of this nature by such organizations could result in a lower sales effort being applied to the company s products and a consequent reduction in the company s operating results 
the company s results of operations can also be materially adversely affected by changes in the inventory strategies of its resellers  which can occur rapidly and may not be related to end user demand 
as part of its continued strategy of selling through multiple distribution channels  the company expects to continue its use of indirect distribution channels  particularly value added resellers and system integrators  in addition to distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
indirect sales may grow as a percentage of both domestic and total net revenues during and beyond  as a result of acquisitions or to increased market penetration 
any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of revenues may adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit costs that are typically charged when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain resellers and distributors who will be able to market the company s products effectively  will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service  or will continue to represent the company s products  and any inability on the part of the company to recruit or retain important resellers or distributors could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
proprietary rights the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection  and  to a lesser extent  patent laws 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult and  while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap and click wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the number of patents applied and granted for software inventions is increasing 
consequently  there is a growing risk of third parties asserting patent claims against the company 
the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties  seeking indemnification against such infringement or indicating that the company may be interested in obtaining a license from such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any of such claims would not result in protracted and costly litigation 
if any claims or actions were to be asserted against the company  and it were required to seek a license of a third party s intellectual property  there can no assurance that it would be able to acquire such a license on reasonable terms or at all  and no prediction can be made about the effect that such a license might have on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
should litigation with respect to any such claim commence  such litigation could be extremely expensive and time consuming  and could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
global market risks the company derived approximately of net revenues from international sales during the year ended december  while the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the company s products or that the company s distributors will be able to effectively meet that demand 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  the limitations imposed by us export laws see government regulation and legal uncertainties below  changes in markets caused by a variety of political  social and economic factors  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences  repatriation of earnings  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  the recent slowdown in north america of purchases of information technology due to current economic conditions will affect the company s ability to generate revenues and profit  and could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation and legal uncertainties the company is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that various laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s products  increase the company s cost of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
further  due to the encryption technology contained in certain of the company s products  such products are subject to us export controls 
there can be no assurance that such export controls  either in their current form or as may be subsequently enacted  will not limit the company s ability to distribute products outside of the united states or electronically 
while the company takes precautions against unlawful exportation  there can be no assurance that inadvertent violations will not occur  and the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to effectively control the distribution of the company s products 
in addition  future federal or state legislation or regulation may further limit levels of encryption or authentication technology 
any such export restriction  new legislation or regulation or unlawful exportation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
quarterly financial information the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly financial information for the company s last eight quarters 
this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the company has experienced  and expects to experience in future periods  significant fluctuations in operating results that may be caused by many factors  including  among others  those described above within factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the company s future revenues and results of operations could be subject to significant volatility and may also be unpredictable due to shipment patterns typical of the software industry 
a significant percentage of the company s revenues are generally recognized in the third month of each quarter and tend to occur in the latter half of that month 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
