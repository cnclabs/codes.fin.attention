overview our primary business strategy is to invest in real estate land  buildings and other improvements and at the same time enter into long term  triple net leases with operators of franchised automobile dealerships  motor vehicle service  repair or parts businesses and related businesses 
we focus on acquiring real estate used by multi site  multi franchised dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
as of december   we owned dealership properties  representing automotive franchises  with a total investment of approximately billion 
these properties total approximately million square feet of buildings and improvements on approximately  acres of land and are located in states alabama  arizona  california  colorado  connecticut  florida  georgia  idaho  illinois  indiana  louisiana  maryland  missouri  nevada  new jersey  new mexico  new york  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  utah and virginia 
substantially all our properties are leased pursuant to long term  triple net leases  under which the tenants typically pay substantially all operating expenses of a property  including  but not limited to  taxes  assessments and other government charges  insurance  utilities  service  repairs  maintenance and other expenses 
the initial lease terms generally range from to years  with a weighted average initial lease term of approximately years  and have options to renew under the same terms and conditions for one or more additional periods of five to years exercisable at the option of the tenant ranging from a total of five to years 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from rents received or accrued under long term  triple net leases  and interest earned from the temporary investment of funds in short term investments 
we incur general and administrative expenses including  principally  compensation expense for our executive officers and other employees  professional fees and various expenses incurred in the process of identifying and acquiring additional properties 
we are self administered and managed by our trustees  executive officers and other employees 
our primary non cash expense is the depreciation of our properties 
we depreciate buildings and improvements on our properties over a year period for tax purposes and a year to year period for financial reporting purposes 
we do not own or lease any significant personal property  furniture or equipment at any property we currently own 
recent developments during the three months ended december   we completed approximately million of acquisitions 
we acquired five dealership properties for approximately million and facility improvements and expansions on previously acquired properties totaling approximately million 
consideration for the properties including facility improvements and expansions was approximately million in permanent financing and the remainder from a combination of funds drawn down on the company s short term credit facilities and cash on hand 
these properties total approximately  square feet of buildings and improvements on approximately acres of land and are located in seven states california  georgia  ohio  south carolina  tennessee  texas and virginia 
these properties have initial lease terms ranging from to years with a weighted average initial lease term of years  and have renewal options exercisable at the option of the tenant ranging from a total of five to years 
acquisitions during the year ended december   we acquired approximately million in total real estate  which included dealership properties  facility improvements and expansions on eight previously acquired properties and two construction fundings 
consideration for the properties including facility improvements  expansions and construction fundings consisted of approximately  units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership units valued at approximately million at the time of acquisition and the remainder from a combination of funds drawn down on the company s short term credit facilities  permanent financing and cash on hand 
we anticipate that the funds drawn down on the company s short term credit facilities will be replaced with permanent financing during the first half of these properties and improvements added approximately  square feet of buildings and improvements on approximately acres of land and are located in states alabama  california  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  north carolina  ohio  south carolina  tennessee  texas and virginia 
these properties have initial lease terms ranging from to years with a weighted average initial lease term of years  and have renewal options exercisable at the option of the tenant ranging from a total of five to years 
results of operations comparison of to rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio and the timing of our property acquisitions  from which we generate our rental income 
we owned properties as of december   versus properties as of december  of which were acquired in the second half of 
in addition  included in rental revenue for the years ended december  and were straight lined rents totaling million and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we began  on a prospective basis  straight lining our rents for leases with fixed minimum escalators 
the effect on periods prior to the third quarter of was not material 
interest and other income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest earned on temporary investments 
there was a timing difference between when the funds were received on debt issued during and the closing of the acquisitions in which the funds were utilized  thereby causing excess cash on hand during part of the year 
these net proceeds were fully used during partially offsetting the decrease in interest income was an increase in the gain on the sale of properties  which increased to  from  in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during those years 
the increase is attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  resulting in an increase in our depreciable assets 
partially offsetting the increase was a change in the depreciable life on the majority of our buildings and improvements that were acquired prior to and that were being depreciated over years 
during the third quarter of  we reviewed the age and estimated remaining useful life of each of our properties in our real estate portfolio that we acquired prior to based on the average age of these assets  we changed the depreciable life on the majority of our buildings and improvements that were currently being depreciated over a year life to a year life in order to properly reflect the estimated remaining useful lives 
the change in depreciable life is considered a change in an accounting estimate and has been recorded on a prospective basis beginning in the third quarter of this change decreased depreciation expense on the assets acquired prior to by approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million  as compared to million for general and administrative expenses  excluding the write off of our  investment in bbcn  a start up on line procurement company for the automotive retail industry  decreased by approximately  or  from during  we wrote off our investment in bbcn as they ceased operations due to their inability to secure the necessary capital to fund their business 
excluding the bbcn write off  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses attributable to staffing reductions that occurred throughout and a reduction in marketing and advertising expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the increase was due to interest incurred for the entire year on debt issued in the second half of and interest incurred on our credit facilities and additional new debt issued in to fund acquisitions 
in addition  as a result of rising interest rates on new debt issued during  the effective interest rate including deferred loan fees amortized over the life of the loans of the company s outstanding debt rose from in to in interest expense also increased because of the additional costs incurred to maintain properties in our borrowing base under our short term credit facilities 
debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness compared to million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness as of december  comparison of to although we were formed prior to january   we did not complete our initial public offering ipo until february   at which time we purchased our initial properties and began generating rental income 
rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio and the timing of our property acquisitions properties owned as of december   versus properties as of december   from which we generate our rental income 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we began  on a prospective basis  straight lining our rents for leases with fixed minimum escalators 
this increased rental revenue for the year ended december  by approximately  the effect on prior years was not material 
interest and other income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for interest and other income during the year ended december  was primarily generated from the investment of the excess of the net proceeds of a private placement offering and our ipo including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option both of which were completed during the first quarter of 
these net proceeds were fully used during and therefore did not generate interest income during interest and other income during was primarily generated from the investment of the excess of debt issuance proceeds over the amount invested in properties and a  gain on the sale of properties during depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during those years

the change in depreciable life is considered a change in accounting estimate and has been recorded on a prospective basis beginning in the third quarter of the impact of this change decreased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase is primarily due to increased payroll and related benefits attributable to personnel additions throughout and severance payments made in connection with staffing reductions during the first quarter of also contributing to the increase were increased marketing expenses as well as increased professional fees and other administrative costs associated with increased public reporting requirements 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in payroll and related expenses as a result of staffing reductions throughout and the closing of the chicago office during the second quarter of interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the increase was due to interest charged on issued debt in late and throughout including mortgage debt and borrowings under our credit facility 
debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately of variable rate indebtedness compared to million all of which was fixed rate indebtedness as of december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents during the years ended december  and were attributable to operating  investing and financing activities  as described below

cash from financing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects million of proceeds received from mortgage loans closed during the year  million of proceeds received from borrowings on our credit facilities  and million of proceeds received from the issuance of common shares  net of fees

the facility matures on march  the facility bears interest equal to the day libor rate plus basis points and requires the repayment of principal within days 
the facility has a one year term  which terminates on march   and is renewable annually 
the more significant debt covenants related to our mortgage debt and credit facilities limit the company s debt to of assets and require the company to comply with minimum debt service coverage and maximum debt to adjusted net worth ratios 
several of our loan agreements contain no financial covenants  however  there are negative covenants relating to customary items such as operation and maintenance of the properties securing the loans and limitations on issuing additional secured debt at those subsidiary levels 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the loan covenants related to our mortgage indebtedness and credit facilities 
liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses  regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt  recurring corporate expenditures  distributions to shareholders and holders of units unitholders  and amounts required for additional property acquisitions and facility improvements and expansions 
we expect to meet these requirements other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions and facility improvements and expansions through cash provided by operating activities 
we anticipate that any additional acquisition of properties or facility improvements and expansions during the next months will be funded with amounts available under our existing credit facilities  future long term secured and unsecured debt and the issuance of common or preferred equity or units 
acquisitions of property and facility improvements and expansions will be made subject to our investment objectives and policies with the intention of maximizing both current income and long term growth in income 
as of december   long term liquidity requirements consisted primarily of maturities under our long term debt 
we anticipate that long term liquidity requirements will also include amounts required for acquisition of properties and facility improvements and expansions 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and other debt and equity financing alternatives 
the availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions 
our liquidity requirements with respect to future acquisitions of properties and facility improvements and expansions may be reduced to the extent that we use units as consideration for such purchases 
we have adopted a policy to limit debt to approximately of our assets calculated as total assets plus accumulated depreciation 
as of december   our debt was approximately of our assets 
this policy may be changed by our board of trustees at any time without shareholder approval 
in addition  to minimize interest rate risk  we generally match the term of the lease with that of the debt as well as the type of the lease with the type of debt fixed or variable in order to maintain an investment spread over the lease term match funding 
we currently intend to substantially match fund at least of our total outstanding long term debt with long term leases 
approximately of our debt outstanding as of december  is substantially match funded  non recourse debt 
we may change the target at any time without shareholder approval 
in light of our current balance sheet position  we believe that we are able to obtain additional financing for our short term and long term capital needs without exceeding our debt to asset ratio policy 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available  or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us 
share repurchase program during  we announced that our board of trustees had authorized the repurchase of up to million common shares 
purchases have been and will be made from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or in negotiated private transactions at the discretion of our management 
during  we repurchased  common shares at an average price of per common share 
since the inception of the share repurchase program  a total of  shares have been repurchased at an average price of per share 
in conjunction with the common share repurchases  the operating partnership redeemed an equivalent number of units from the company for equivalent purchase prices 
dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan during april  we implemented a dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  which was subsequently amended in march the drip 
under the drip  current shareholders and unitholders are permitted to elect to reinvest all  a portion or none of their cash dividends or distributions to purchase common shares 
the drip also allows both new investors and existing shareholders and unitholders to make optional cash payments to purchase common shares 
the drip permits current shareholders  unitholders and new investors to invest a minimum of up to a maximum of  in common shares per month 
the drip also allows us to raise additional capital by waiving the limitations on the  maximum per month  as more fully described in the prospectus relating to the drip 
shares purchased under the drip through reinvestment of dividends are purchased at a discount currently 
shares purchased under the drip through optional cash payments of  or less are purchased at market price 
common shares may be purchased directly from the company or in open market or privately negotiated transactions  as determined from time to time by the company  to fulfill the requirements for the drip 
for the year ended december   we issued approximately  additional shares under the drip and received approximately million in proceeds 
shelf registration statement on march   we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf registration statement with the commission relating to the future offering of up to an aggregate of million of common shares  preferred shares  debt securities and warrants exercisable for common or preferred shares 
management believes the shelf registration statement will provide the company with more efficient and immediate access to capital markets when considered appropriate 
as of december   the company had not issued any securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement and  thus  million was available under the shelf registration statement for the issuance of securities 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined under the revised definition adopted in october by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss before minority interest computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from sales of property plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
to conform to nareit s revised ffo definition adopted in  we began in the first quarter of including straight lined rents in the calculation of ffo 
prior to the first quarter of  we excluded straight lined rents from the ffo calculation 
for comparison purposes  we have included straight lined rents in the ffo calculation for all periods presented 
we began straight lining rents on a prospective basis in the third quarter of the effect of straight lined rents on prior periods was not material 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
we consider ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
comparison of our presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
ffo for the years ended december  and is computed as follows in thousands net income before minority interest   real estate depreciation and amortization   gain on sale of assets funds from operations   weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute basic ffo per share   weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute fully diluted ffo per share   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by our management as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
as of december   we had fixed rate indebtedness totaling approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments at december  had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately million 
as of december   we had variable rate indebtedness totaling approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt 
if the interest rate on our variable rate debt instruments outstanding at december  had been one percentage point higher or lower  our annual interest expense relating to those debt instruments would have increased or decreased  respectively  by approximately million  based on balances at december
