item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview from our inception in through  we derived the substantial majority of our revenue from digital filter processors and vector signal processors used principally in military  industrial and medical applications 
in  we repositioned our business to develop and market data compression products for the evolving multimedia markets and discontinued development of digital filter processor and vector signal processor products 
in  we discontinued production of these products 
our current lines of digital audio and video products include integrated circuits and related products used in digital versatile disc players  movie and home theater systems  filmless digital cameras and video editing systems 
we derive most of our revenues from the sale of our integrated circuit products 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
average selling prices for our hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  primarily as a result of changes in our customer mix of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  sales versus sales to distributors and the transition from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have reduced the prices of some of our products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
our cost of product sales consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of product sales to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
our product gross margin is also dependent on product mix and on the percentage of products sold directly to our oem customers versus indirectly through our marketing partners who purchase our products at lower prices but absorb most of the associated marketing and sales support expenses  maintain inventories and provide customer support and training 
lower gross margins on sales to distributors are partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to such sales 
product sales in japan are primarily made through fujifilm  our strategic partner and distributor in japan 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than our other distributors 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing further fluctuations in margins 
we also derive revenue from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenue includes one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
in addition  we have historically generated a significant percentage of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers  although development revenue has declined as a percentage of total revenues over the past several years 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
these development contracts provide for license and milestone payments which are recorded as development revenue 
we classify all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development contracts 
while we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  we expect development revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
we are also a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states binational industrial research and development foundation  which fund up to of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums 
these agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and require us to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales  and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  royalties  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support our anticipated growth 
we conduct most of our research and development and certain sales and marketing and administrative operations in israel through our wholly owned israeli subsidiary 
as a result  some of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels 
to date  substantially all of our product sales and our development and licensing revenue have been denominated in us dollars and most costs of product sales have been incurred in us dollars 
we expect that most of our sales and costs of sales will continue to be denominated and incurred in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
we have not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such fluctuations 
we may in the future elect to take appropriate action to reduce our foreign exchange risk 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of net operating losses which we have utilized to reduce taxable income for us federal income tax purposes and by our israeli subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal net operating losses expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in in june  we sold to mgi software of canada the intellectual property related to our softdvd product line and transferred to mgi certain related software development and support resources in exchange for cash  mgi common stock and future royalties 
our results for the second quarter of included a  gain realized from this transaction which was reported as part of interest and other income or expense 
in connection with this transaction  we also recorded a charge that reduced software  licensing and development revenue for the quarter by  for possible issues related to receivables associated with the softdvd product line 
the net impact of the mgi transaction on our operating results was an after tax gain of  or per share on a diluted basis 
this gain did not reflect the potential future economic benefit that may be derived from this transaction and realized in future periods in the form of royalties 
we do not currently expect  however  that these royalties will have a material impact on quarterly revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the shares of mgi stock received by us as part of this transaction are subject to future appreciation or depreciation 
our software revenues have declined significantly as a result of the sale of the softdvd product line 
on june   we acquired pixelcam  inc pixelcam  a manufacturer of megapixel cmos image sensors  in exchange for  shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
of our common stock issued in the acquisition   shares are subject to repurchase by us until the satisfaction of vesting periods applicable to the pixelcam shares for which they were exchanged 
additional shares of our common stock are contingently issuable to former pixelcam stockholders upon achievement of certain milestones 
any contingent consideration will be valued and recorded as of the date the satisfaction of the applicable milestones becomes probable 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in connection with the pixelcam acquisition  we recorded a one time charge of million as a write off of acquired in process research and development and recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million 
on october   we acquired nogatech  inc nogatech  a manufacturer of usb multimedia controllers  in exchange for  shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations and estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in connection with the nogatech acquisition  we recorded a one time charge of million as a write off of nogatech s in process research and development and recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million

for  chief scientist reimbursements were  gross r d expenses increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions of pixelcam in june and nogatech in october as well as our planned enhancement to our technology and development capabilities 
r d expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to in  compared to in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech  the continued expansion of our china office and the opening of our taiwan office 
amortization of goodwill and write off of acquired in process research and development 
the acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech resulted in the following charges 
pixelcam during  we recorded million in charges related to the amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisition of pixelcam 
in addition to the amortization charge  we recorded  during the second quarter of  a million charge related to the pixelcam acquisition and the associated write off of acquired in process research and development 
the allocation of million of the purchase price to the acquired in process research and development was determined by identifying the research project which technological feasibility had not been established at the time of the acquisition and for which no alternative future uses then existed 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the project once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the percentage of completion was determined using costs incurred by pixelcam prior to the acquisition date compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the project to technological feasibility 
the company estimated  as of the acquisition date  the project was complete and the estimated costs to complete the project were approximately million 
nogatech during  we recorded million in charges related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our acquisition of nogatech 
in addition to the amortization charge  we recorded  during the fourth quarter of  a million charge related to the nogatech acquisition and the associated write off of acquired in process research and development 
the allocation of million of the purchase price to the acquired in process research and development was determined by identifying the research project which technological feasibility had not been established at the time of the acquisition and for which no alternative future uses then existed 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the project once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the percentage of completion was determined using costs incurred by nogatech prior to the acquisition date compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the project to technological feasibility 
the company estimated  as of the acquisition date  the project was complete and the estimated costs to complete the project were approximately million 
the company expects to complete both of these projects within months from the acquisition dates of june  and october  for pixelcam and nogatech  respectively 
however  development of these projects remains subject to significant risks due to the remaining effort that will be required to achieve technical feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets and significant competitive threats 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could adversely impact our future sales and profitability 
additionally  the value of the intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income increased by to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from increased interest income on higher cash balances following a follow on public offering of common stock in december provision for income taxes 
excluding charges related to the amortization of goodwill and the write off of acquired in process research and development our estimated effective tax rate remained at for and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased by to million in from million in product sales increased by to million in from million in the increase in product sales resulted primarily from increased unit sales of dvd and super video cd products 
software  licensing and development revenues decreased by to million in from million in this decrease was principally due to a decline in software licensing revenues following the sale of our softdvd product line in june and  to a lesser degree  a decline in development revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from licenses of our integrated circuit cores 
product gross margin 
product gross margin increased to for compared to for the increase was due to a shift in product mix to a higher percentage of higher margin products  a shift in customer mix to a greater percentage of direct sales to oem customers and lower per unit manufacturing costs as a result of increased unit sales 
research and development 
r d expenses decreased by to million in from million in r d expenses in were net of reimbursements in the amounts of  under product development agreements with the chief scientist 
for  chief scientist reimbursements were  gross r d expenses decreased as a result of a decline in software development activities in the second half of the year following the sale of our softdvd product line in june r d expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in  compared to in selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to product market development and to support planned revenue growth in china 
interest and other income expense  net 
net interest and other income increased by to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from a  gain realized from the sale of our softdvd product line in the second quarter of provision for income taxes 
our estimated effective tax rate decreased to for from in the decrease reflects our income tax expectation going forward based on increasing foreign operations taxed at lower rates 
liquidity and capital resources during  our capital requirements were satisfied primarily by cash flows from operations 
in december  we received net proceeds of million from a public offering of our common stock 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million of working capital 
in addition  we had million of investments in other assets that have maturity dates that are beyond one year 
our operating activities provided cash of million during  primarily due to net income adjusted for the non cash impact of depreciation  amortization of goodwill  and write off of acquired in process research and development associated with our acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech during increases in inventory  accounts receivable  and prepaid expenses were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
cash used in investing activities was million during the twelve months ended december  capital equipment expenditures accounted for million of the cash used while the purchase of long term investments used million 
cash provided by the sale of short term investments was partially offset by acquisition costs net of cash provided 
cash provided by financing activities was during and primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our incentive stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to o the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  o the market acceptance of our products  o the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  o our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  o volume pricing concessions  o capital improvements to new and existing facilities  o technological advances  o the response of competitors to our products  and o our relationships with our suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for consummation of any acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations  are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
selected pro forma financial data the following pro forma results of operations of zoran corporation do not represent our results of operations or earnings per share information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
pro forma results of operations have been presented  in addition to the actual results  to provide period to period comparability of our underlying operating results excluding the following amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  the write off of acquired in process technology  and the amortization of deferred stock based compensation associated with the acquisition of nogatech  inc year ended december  in thousands  except per share data pro forma net revenues      pro forma income from operations     pro forma net income     pro forma net income per share basic diluted future performance and risk factors our future business operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly due to a number of factors  including o fluctuation in demand for our products  o the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  o the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and our customers products  o the timing of large customer orders  o the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  o the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  o the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  o changes in the mix of products sold  o seasonality in demand for our products  o competitive pricing pressures  and o the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our integrated circuits and embedded software 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including o the cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity  o fluctuations in manufacturing yields  o the emergence of new industry standards  o product obsolescence  and o the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
our operating results could also be harmed by o economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business  o other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  or o a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the consumer electronics market 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast 
we place orders to purchase our products from independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from our customers 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
if anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled or do not occur  gross margins may be reduced 
a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on our forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet our expectations we may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could harm our operating results 
as a result of these factors  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by securities analysts could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock 
our success for the foreseeable future will be dependent on growth in demand for integrated circuits for digital versatile disc  or dvd  super video cd  digital audio  video editing and filmless digital camera applications and our ability to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate those types of integrated circuits into their products 
in  we derived a majority of our product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for dvd and super video cd applications 
we expect that sales of our products for dvd and super video cd applications  filmless digital camera applications  digital audio applications and video editing applications will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the near future 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes our sales to fluctuate 
because the markets our customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our products 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if our products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products 
a delay in the customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related mature product 
our customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the fourth calendar quarter represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday period  and therefore a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
we expect these sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
product supply and demand in the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
in some cases  these downturns have lasted more than one year 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry could harm our sales and revenues if demand drops or our gross margins if average selling prices decline 
the development and evolution of markets for our integrated circuits is dependent on factors such as industry standards  over which we have no control  for example  if manufacturers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to the manufacturers and our sales would suffer 
the emergence of markets for our products is affected by a variety of factors beyond our control 
in particular  our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards 
manufacturers may not continue to follow these standards  which would make our products less desirable to manufacturers and reduce our sales 
also  competing standards may emerge that are preferred by manufacturers  which could also reduce our sales and require us to make significant expenditures to develop new products 
the emergence of new markets for our products is also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products 
if content compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products is not available  manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating our integrated circuits  and our sales to manufacturers would suffer 
we rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuits  and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we do not operate any manufacturing facilities  and we rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our products 
these independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
from time to time there are manufacturing capacity shortages in the semiconductor industry 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers  including our principal supplier  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc 
therefore  tsmc is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including o the inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  o the unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of our products  o reduced control over delivery schedules  o reduced control over quality assurance  o reduced control over manufacturing yields and cost  and o potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  tsmc and some of our other foundries are located in areas of the world which are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
while the earthquake in taiwan did not have a material impact on our independent foundries  a similar event centered near tsmc s facility could severely reduce tsmc s ability to manufacture our integrated circuits 
the loss of any of our manufacturers as a supplier  our inability to expand the supply of our products in response to increased demand  or our inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of our products 
any of these circumstances could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we also rely on independent contractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
at present  most of our semiconductor products are assembled by one of five independent contractors ase  amkor  asat  national semiconductor or vate 
our semiconductor products are tested by these contractors or other independent contractors 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits our control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the services provided by our assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require us to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of our products 
these constraints or delays could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
because foundry capacity is limited we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have considered and will continue to consider various arrangements with suppliers  which could include  among others o option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  o nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  o contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  o issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  o investment in a foundry  o joint ventures  or o other partnership relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
if our independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in photomasks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non functional 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
as a result  foundries often experience problems achieving acceptable yields  which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular wafer 
poor yields from our independent foundries would reduce our ability to deliver our products to customers  harm our relationships with our customers  and harm our business 
to be successful  we must efficiently develop new and enhanced products to meet rapidly changing customer requirements and industry standards 
the markets for our products are characterized by o rapidly changing technologies  o evolving industry standards  o frequent new product introductions  and o short product life cycles 
we expect to increase our product development expenses  and our future success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced products that meet rapidly changing customer requirements and industry standards 
we may not successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition to new products 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  lack of market acceptance for such products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our sales and financial results 
we face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
competition in the compression technology market has historically been dominated by large companies such as stmicroelectronics and companies that develop and use their own integrated circuits  such as sony 
as this market continues to develop  we face competition from other large semiconductor vendors  including o c cube microsystems  o cirrus logic crystal semiconductor  o conexant  o fujitsu  o lsi logic  o motorola  and o texas instruments 
for example  in the markets for jpeg based products for use in filmless digital cameras  conexant is providing cmos sensor and camera dsp solutions to third parties 
we also face competition from internally developed solutions developed and used by major japanese original equipment manufacturers  who may also be our customers 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater resources than ours in many areas  including o finances  o manufacturing  o technology  o marketing  and o distribution 
many of our competitors have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete 
in addition  a number of private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same digital multimedia compression problems that our products address 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  we could experience price reductions  order cancellations and reduced gross margins  any one of which could harm our business 
the dvd market is growing  and additional competitors are expected to enter the market for dvd players and software 
some of these potential competitors may develop captive implementations for use only with their own pc and consumer electronics products 
it is also possible that application software vendors  such as microsoft  may attempt to enter the dvd application market in the future 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods  if we are unable to reduce our costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results would suffer 
average selling prices for our products decline over relatively short time periods 
many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we sell more units  and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we may experience these problems in the future and cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
we derive most of our revenue from sales to a small number of large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
our largest customers account for a substantial percentage of our revenues 
in  sales to fujifilm accounted for of our total revenues and of our product sales 
our four largest customers in accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
during  our four largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenues with fujifilm accounting for 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to retain our key customers or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers could harm our sales and financial results 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial results 
we are dependent on our relationship with fujifilm for a significant percentage of our product sales  and if this relationship were terminated  our business would be harmed 
fujifilm has been our largest customer in four of the last five years 
fujifilm purchases our products primarily as a distributor 
under our arrangement with fujifilm  fujifilm acts as the primary distributor in japan of products developed by us under development contracts with fujifilm 
fujifilm also sells some of these products in japan under its own name 
we may sell these products directly in japan only to specified customers and must first buy the products from fujifilm 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than our other distributors 
fujifilm also has a nonexclusive license to distribute most of our products outside of japan 
fujifilm has provided wafer manufacturing services on a most favored terms basis to us since and has also provided funding to support our development efforts 
if our relationship with fujifilm were terminated  our business would be harmed 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increases our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our earnings 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into larger systems 
as a result  our sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months or even years 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of an early termination by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which would harm our financial results 
we are dependent upon our international sales and operations  economic  political or military events in a country where we make significant sales or have significant operations could interfere with our success or operations there and harm our business 
during  of our total revenues were derived from international sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
to support our international sales activities  we have established offices in china  japan  taiwan and recently in hong kong and korea 
in addition  substantially all of our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 
we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business internationally  including o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o fluctuations in exchange rates  o political and economic instability  o imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and o the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
the majority of our research and development personnel and facilities and a significant portion of our sales personnel are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
some of our officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually 
the absence of these employees for significant periods during the work week may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods 
during  we opened an office in shenzhen  china 
our operations in china are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country 
for example  the chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors and has recently been slowing 
this growth may continue to decrease and any slowdown may have a negative effect on our business 
the chinese economy has experienced deflation which may also occur in the future 
this deflation could result in devaluation of the chinese yuan  which could reduce our sales to the chinese market 
the prices of our products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of our products 
prices for our products are currently denominated in us dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency and our products may be less competitive in that country 
also  we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from challenges by third parties 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we could become subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties intellectual property rights 
we could become subject to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of allegations that we infringe others intellectual property rights 
claims that our products infringe proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following o stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  o obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  o pay damages  or o redesign those products that use such technology 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our products could become obsolete 
from time to time we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements  we may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
if we are not able to apply our net operating losses against taxable income in future periods  our financial results will be harmed 
our future net income and cash flow will be affected by our ability to apply our net operating losses  which totaled approximately million for federal tax reporting purposes as of december   against taxable income in future periods 
our net operating losses incurred prior to the consummation of our initial public offering in that we can use to reduce future taxable income for federal tax purposes are limited to approximately million per year 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses could harm our financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
we have made investments in  and acquisitions of  complementary companies  products and technologies 
during  we acquired pixelcam and nogatech  and we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could o issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  o incur debt  o assume liabilities  o incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  or o incur large and immediate write offs 
our operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including o problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  o unanticipated costs  o diversion of management s attention from our core business  o adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  o risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and o potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products or technologies or personnel that we might acquire and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition 
our products could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could damage market acceptance of our products 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
if we do not maintain our current development contracts or are unable to enter into new development contracts  our business could be harmed 
we historically have generated a significant percentage of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
under these contracts  we receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones 
if we fail to achieve the milestones specified in our existing development contracts  if our existing contracts are terminated or we are unable to secure future development contracts  our ability to cost effectively develop new products would be reduced and our business would be harmed 
we may need additional funds to execute our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain such funds  we will not be able to expand our business as planned 
we may require substantial additional capital to finance our future growth  secure additional foundry capacity and fund our ongoing research and development activities beyond our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o acceptance of and demand for our products  o the types of arrangements that we may enter into with our independent foundries  and o the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects 
to the extent that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our activities  we may need to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed or  if available  it may not be available on terms favorable to us 
if we fail to manage our future growth  if any  our business would be harmed 
we anticipate that our future growth  if any  will require us to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
our ability to manage our growth successfully will also require us to expand and improve our administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of our key operations  including the major portion of our research and development operations and a significant portion of our sales and administrative operations  are located in israel 
a majority of our sales and marketing and certain of our research and development and administrative personnel  including our president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on our resources and our ability to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business would be harmed 
we rely on the services of our executive officers and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our senior management 
the loss of key management personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we may not be able to retain the services of any of our key employees 
we believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  both in the united states and in israel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract  integrate and retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
the israeli rate of inflation may negatively impact our costs if it exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the us dollar 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel in relation to the dollar  which will increase our costs as expressed in dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the new israeli shekel 
these measures may not adequately protect us from the impact of inflation in israel 
the government programs we participate in and tax benefits we receive require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
in the year ended december   we received an aggregate of  in grants for research and development from the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade 
to continue to be eligible for these grants  our development projects must be approved by the chief scientist on a case by case basis 
if our development projects are not approved by the chief scientist  we will not receive grants to fund these projects  which would increase our research and development costs 
we also receive tax benefits  in particular exemptions and reductions as a result of the approved enterprise status of our existing operations in israel 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  we must maintain our approved enterprise status by meeting conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets located in israel and investing additional equity in our israeli subsidiary 
if we fail to meet these conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled and we could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
israeli governmental authorities have indicated that the government may reduce or eliminate these benefits in the future  which would harm our business 
we have anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and there are provisions of delaware law that could prevent or delay a change in control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these include provisions o prohibiting a merger with a party that has acquired control of or more of our outstanding common stock  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party acquired control of of our outstanding common stock  o authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  o eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders  and o requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in between january  and december   the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market  ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including o announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  o quarterly variations in operating results  o changes in analysts earnings estimates  o announcements of technological innovations  o the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  o proprietary rights or other litigation  o general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and o developments in the financial markets 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the new israeli shekel would have an immaterial affect on our financial condition
