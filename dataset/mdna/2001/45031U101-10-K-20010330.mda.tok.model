each share of trinet series a  series b and series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock was converted into a share of series b  series c or series d respectively cumulative redeemable preferred stock of the company 
the company s preferred stock issued to the former trinet preferred shareholders has substantially the same terms as the trinet preferred stock  except that the new series b  c and d preferred shares have additional voting rights not associated with the trinet preferred stock 
the company s series a preferred stock remained outstanding with the same rights and preferences as existed prior to the trinet acquisition 
as a consequence of the acquisition of its external advisor  the company is now internally managed and no longer pays external advisory fees 
the transactions described above and other related transactions have materially impacted the historical operations of the company

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest income interest income increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the same period in this increase is a result of the interest generated by million of newly originated loan investments during fiscal and an additional million funded under existing loan commitments 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest earned as a result of principal repayments of approximately million made to the company on its loan investments during the year ended december  in addition  the increase was in part due to higher average interest rates on the company s variable rate loans and other lending investments 
operating lease income operating lease income increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the same period in approximately million of this increase is attributable to operating lease income generated from corporate tenant lease assets acquired in the acquisition of trinet  which were included in operations for the entire year in fiscal as compared to only approximately two months in fiscal in addition  approximately million resulted from income generated by million of new corporate tenant lease investments

approximately million of this increase is attributable to interest expense incurred by the leasing subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition  which was included in operations for the entire year in fiscal as compared to only approximately two months in in addition  the increase was in part due to higher average aggregate borrowings by the company on its credit facilities  other term loans and secured notes  the proceeds of which were used to fund additional investments 
the increase was also attributable to higher average interest rates on the company s variable rate debt obligations 
operating costs corporate tenant lease assets for the year ended december   operating costs associated with corporate tenant lease assets increased by approximately million to approximately million  net of recoveries from tenants 
such operating costs represent unreimbursed operating expenses associated with corporate tenant lease assets

as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has not realized any actual losses on any of its loan investments to date 
however  the company has considered it prudent to establish a policy of providing reserves for potential losses in the current portfolio which may occur in the future 
accordingly  since its first full quarter as a public company the quarter ended june   management has reflected quarterly provisions for possible credit losses in its operating results 
the company will continue to recognize quarterly provisions until a stabilized reserve level is attained 
stock option compensation expense stock compensation expense increased by approximately million as a result of charges relating to grants of stock options to the company s employees  including amortization of the deferred charge related to options granted to employees of the company s former external advisor subsequent to such personnel becoming direct employees of the company as of november  advisory fees there were no advisory fees during the year ended december  because  subsequent to the acquisition of the company s external advisor  the company is now internally managed

in connection with this paydown  the venture incurred certain prepayment penalties  which resulted in an extraordinary loss to the company of  during the third quarter of there were no comparable early extinguishments of debt during the year ended december   including by the leasing subsidiary after its acquisition on november  year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest income during fiscal year  interest income increased by approximately million over interest income for fiscal year this increase is a result of the interest generated by the loans and other investments contributed in the recapitalization transactions  as well as approximately million of loans and other lending investments newly originated or acquired by the company during and an additional million funded under existing commitments 
the increase was partially offset by principal repayments of approximately million made to the company during fiscal year operating lease income operating lease income increased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year due to approximately million in operating lease income generated from corporate tenant lease assets acquired in the acquisition of trinet 
other income included in other income for fiscal year is a fee associated with the repayment of a construction loan of approximately million  yield maintenance payments of approximately million resulting from the repayment of three loans  and approximately million in additional revenue from certain cash flow participation features on five of the company s loan investments 
interest expense the company s interest expense increased by million as a result of higher average borrowings by the company on its credit facilities and other term loans  the proceeds of which were used to fund additional loan origination and acquisition activities 
the increase was also attributable to higher average interest rates on the company s variable rate debt obligations 
further  interest expense includes interest incurred by the leasing subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition 
operating costs corporate tenant lease assets such operating costs represent unreimbursed operating expenses incurred by the leasing subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased as a result of a full year s depreciation on the company s pre existing corporate tenant leasing portfolio  as well as depreciation on the leasing subsidiary s net leased assets subsequent to its acquisition 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased by approximately million as a result of additional costs incurred subsequent to the acquisition of the company s external advisor  as well as additional administrative expenses associated with the leasing subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition 
provision for possible credit losses the company s charge for provision for possible credit losses increased by approximately million as a result of expanded lending operations as well as additional seasoning of the company s existing lending portfolio 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has not realized any actual losses on any of its loan investments to date 
however  the company has considered it prudent to establish a policy of providing reserves for potential losses in the current portfolio which may occur in the future 
accordingly  since its first full quarter as a public company the quarter ended june   management has reflected quarterly provisions for possible credit losses in its operating results 
the company will continue to recognize quarterly provisions until a stabilized reserve level is attained 
stock option compensation expense stock option compensation expense declined by approximately million as a result of the non recurring charge relating to the original grant of stock options to the company s external advisor in fiscal concurrently with the consummation of the recapitalization transactions 
advisory fees base advisory fees increased by approximately million as a result of fees being incurred from june  through year end in the prior year and through november  in fiscal further  as a result of the company s expanded operations  incentive fees paid under the prior advisory contract increased from million in to million in subsequent to the acquisition of the company s external advisor  the company is now internally managed and no further advisory fees will be incurred 
costs incurred in acquiring external advisor finally  as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included in fiscal costs and expenses is a non recurring  non cash charge of approximately million relating to the acquisition of the company s external advisor 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital to fund its investment activities and operating expenses 
the company has significant access to capital resources to fund its existing business plan  which includes the expansion of its real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing businesses 
the company s capital sources include cash flow from operations  borrowings under lines of credit  additional term borrowings  long term financing secured by the company s assets  unsecured financing and the issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
further  the company may acquire other businesses or assets using its capital stock  cash or a combination thereof 
the distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code limit the company s ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish capital committed to its operations 
however  the company believes that its significant capital resources and access to financing will provide it with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements  including expected new lending and leasing transactions 
the company s ability to meet its long term ie  beyond one year liquidity requirements is subject to the renewal of its credit lines and or obtaining other sources of financing  including issuing additional debt or equity from time to time 
any decision by the company s lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with the company will depend upon a number of factors  such as compliance with the terms of its existing credit arrangements  the company s financial performance  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
based on its monthly interest and other expenses  monthly cash receipts  existing investment commitments and funding plans  the company believes that its existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting its short and long term liquidity needs 
material increases in monthly interest expense or material decreases in monthly cash receipts would negatively impact the company s liquidity 
on the other hand  material decreases in monthly interest expense would positively affect the company s liquidity 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  at december   the company had existing fixed rate borrowings of approximately million secured by real estate under operating leases which mature in  an aggregate of approximately million in libor based  variable rate loans secured by various senior and subordinate mortgage investments and real estate under operating leases which mature between fiscal and  fixed rate corporate debt obligations aggregating approximately million which mature between and  and other variable and fixed rate secured debt obligations aggregating approximately million which mature at various dates through in addition  the company has entered into libor based secured revolving credit facilities of and million which expire in fiscal and  respectively 
as of december   the company had drawn approximately million and million under these facilities  respectively 
availability under these facilities is based on collateral provided under a borrowing base calculation 
the company also has two unsecured credit facilities totaling million 
the million facility had no outstanding balance as of december   matures in january and bears interest at libor plus 
in addition  the leasing subsidiary s million unsecured credit facility had a balance of million as of december   matures on may  with a one year extension period at the company s option and bears interest at libor plus 
under the terms of the this facility  the leasing subsidiary is generally permitted to make cash distributions to the company in an amount equal to of cash flow from operations in any rolling four quarter period 
subsequent to year end  the company extended the term of this facility to may the company has entered into libor interest rate caps struck at  and in notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively  which expire in march  january and june  respectively 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition of trinet  the company acquired libor interest rate caps currently struck at  and in notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively  which expire in december  december and june  respectively 
in connection with the closing of stars  series in may  the company entered into a libor interest rate cap struck at in the notional amount of million  and simultaneously sold a libor interest rate cap with the same terms 
since these instruments do not reduce the company s net interest rate risk exposure  they do not qualify as hedges and changes in their respective values are charged to earnings 
as the significant terms of these arrangements are substantially the same  the effects of a revaluation of these two instruments are expected to substantially offset one another 
at december   the net fair value of the company s interest rate caps was approximately million 
the company has entered into libor interest rate swaps struck at  and in notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively which expire in march  june and june  respectively 
these swaps effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of the company s floating rate term loan obligations 
in connection with the acquisition of trinet  the company acquired an interest rate swap which  together with certain existing interest rate cap agreements  effectively fix the interest rate on million of the leasing subsidiary s libor based borrowings at plus the applicable margin through december  management expects that it will have aggregate libor based borrowings at the leasing subsidiary in excess of the notional amount for the duration of the swap 
the actual borrowing cost to the company with respect to indebtedness covered by the swap will depend upon the applicable margin over libor for such indebtedness  which will be determined by the terms of the relevant debt instruments 
in june  an interest rate swap with a notional amount of approximately million matured 
at december   the fair value liability of the company s interest rate swaps was million 
during the year ended december   the company settled an aggregate notional amount of approximately million that was outstanding under certain hedging agreements which the company had entered into in order to hedge the potential effects of interest rate movements on anticipated fixed rate borrowings 
the settlement of such agreements resulted in the receipt of approximately million which had been deferred pending completion of the planned fixed rate financing transaction 
subsequently  the transaction was modified and consummated as a variable rate financing transaction 
as a result  the previously deferred receipt no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment and the million was recognized as a gain and included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company refinanced its million term loan maturing march  with a million term loan maturing march  the new term loan bears interest at per annum  payable monthly  and amortizes over an approximately year schedule 
the new term loan represented forecasted transactions for which the company had previously entered into us treasury based hedging transactions 
the net million cost of the settlement of such hedges has been deferred and is being amortized as an increase to the effective financing costs of the new term loan over its effective ten year term 
on may   the company closed the inaugural offering under its proprietary matched funding program  stars  series in the initial transaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company issued million of investment grade bonds secured by the subsidiary s assets  which had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately billion at inception 
principal payments received on the assets will be utilized to repay the most senior class of the bonds then outstanding 
the maturity of the bonds match funds the maturity of the underlying assets financed under the program 
the company initially purchased the class f bonds at a par value of million  which the company financed with a million repurchase agreement maturing in may  which has a balance of million at december  on july   the company sold  at par  million of the class f bonds to an institutional investor 
for accounting purposes  these transactions were treated as secured financings 
on december   the company expanded its existing million secured warehouse facility to million 
the company extended the original march maturity date to march  including a one year term out extension option to the facility s maturity during which the interest rate spread will increase basis points  no additional draws under the facility will be permitted  and the outstanding principal must amortize per quarter 
in connection with the extension  the company and the facility lender also increased the range of collateral eligible for inclusion in the facility 
also in connection with the extension  the company agreed to increase the facility s interest rate from libor plus to a revised rate of libor plus to  depending upon certain conditions 
on january   the company closed a new million secured revolving credit facility which is led by a major commercial bank 
the new facility has a three year primary term and one year term out extension option  and bears interest at libor plus to  depending upon the collateral contributed to the borrowing base 
the new facility accepts a broad range of structured finance assets and has a final maturity of january stock repurchase program the board of directors approved  and the company has implemented  a stock repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock from time to time  primarily using proceeds from the disposition of assets and excess cash flow from operations  but also using borrowings under its credit facilities if the company determines that it is advantageous to do so 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
adjusted earnings adjusted earnings represents net income computed in accordance with gaap  before gains losses on sales of corporate tenant lease assets  extraordinary items and cumulative effect  plus depreciation and amortization  less preferred stock dividends  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect adjusted earnings on the same basis 
the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the historical operating results of the company  adjusted earnings should be examined in conjunction with net income as shown in the consolidated statements of operations 
adjusted earnings should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs 
for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share data unaudited adjusted earnings net income   add depreciation   add joint venture depreciation  add amortization   add costs incurred in acquiring external advisor  less preferred dividends   less net income allocable to class b shares less gain on sale of corporate tenant lease assets  add extraordinary loss early extinguishment of debt adjusted earnings allocable to common shareholders basic   diluted   adjusted earnings per common share basic diluted explanatory note for the year ended december   net income allocable to class b shares represents of net income allocable to the company s class b shares 
on november   the class b shares were exchanged for common shares in connection with the company s acquisition of trinet and related transactions 
as a result  the company now has a single class of common shares outstanding 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

on june   the fasb voted to defer the effectiveness of sfas no 
for one year 
sfas no

establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or in certain circumstances a hedge of a foreign currency exposure

 january  because the company has primarily used derivatives as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk only  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material financial impact on the financial position and results of operations of the company 
however  should the company change its current use of such derivatives see note  the adoption of sfas no 
could have a more significant effect on the company prospectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing its business plan  the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with its liability management objectives  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that floating rate assets be primarily financed by floating rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
the company s operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on its assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on the company s interest bearing assets  which the company may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on its borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of the company s interest bearing assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of the company s interest earning assets 
a substantial portion of the company s loan investments are subject to significant prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to the company 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while the company generally seeks to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  the company could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while the company has not experienced any significant credit losses  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to the company which adversely affect its liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company employs match funding based hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  floors  swaps  futures and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce the company s exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes nor as a hedge against changes in credit risk of its borrowers or of the company itself 
each interest rate cap or floor agreement is a legal contract between the company and a third party the counterparty 
when the company purchases a cap or floor contract  the company makes an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to the company in the future should the reference rate typically one or three month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  the company will earn cap income 
should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  the company will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
the cost of the up front payment is amortized over the term of the contract 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
in general  the company s swaps are pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of floating rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from the company 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of that of the specified instrument eg  eg treasury securities upon settlement 
the company generally uses such instruments to hedge forecasted fixed rate borrowings 
under these agreements  the company will generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments will be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  the company will cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
while a reit may freely utilize the types of derivative instruments discussed above to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities  the use of derivatives for other purposes  including hedging asset related risks such as credit  prepayment or interest rate exposure on the company s loan assets  could generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  the company may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks on a limited basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
the company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  the company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that the company will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract it enters into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase or decrease basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases as of december   less related interest expense and operating costs on corporate tenant lease assets  for the year ended december  net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of off balance sheet instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets  less cash out flows in respect of interest bearing liabilities as of december  the cash flows associated with the company s assets are calculated based on management s best estimate of expected payments for each loan based on loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history  prepayment penalty  term and collateral type 
most of the company s loans are protected from prepayment as a result of prepayment penalties and contractual terms which prohibit prepayments during specified periods 
however  for those loans where prepayments are not currently precluded by contract  declines in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
estimated percentage change in net investment net fair value of change in interest rates income financial instruments basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points explanatory note amounts exclude fair values of non financial investments  primarily assets under long term operating leases and certain forms of corporate finance investments
