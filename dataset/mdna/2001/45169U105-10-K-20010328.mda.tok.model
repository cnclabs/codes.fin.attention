item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview igate capital corporation  formerly named mastech corporation  was incorporated in the commonwealth of pennsylvania on november  and  through operating subsidiaries  is a worldwide provider of it services and eservices to large and medium sized organizations 
from inception and through february  we conducted the majority of our business through our wholly owned subsidiary mastech systems corporation  a pennsylvania corporation that was formed in july in march  we announced an internal reorganization  changed our name to igate capital corporation  and we transferred substantially all of the assets of mastech systems corporation to subsidiary operating companies 
this reorganization enabled us to identify and penetrate emerging it and eservices markets quickly and effectively 
in addition  this strategy enabled us to expand our existing portfolio of services as well as to create new service offerings 
we also acquired majority interests or made strategic investments in a number of companies in the eservices market sector 
our operating subsidiaries provide clients with a source for a broad range of it applications solutions and eservices  including client server design and development  conversion migration services  erp package implementation services  electronic business systems and applications maintenance outsourcing 
these services are provided in a variety of computing environments and use leading technologies  including client server architecture  object oriented programming languages and tools  distributed database management systems and the latest networking and communications technologies 
the companies in the emplifi  ejiva  mascot  value services and staffing services segments earn a substantial portion of their revenues on a time and materials basis as services are performed 
mascot and ejiva also earn revenue on a proportional performance basis  based upon a fixed price 
companies in the emerging eservices segment primarily recognize revenues on both a time and materials and proportional performance basis  with itiliti recognizing revenues upon implementation and client acceptance of an application and through monthly service fees  in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
all historical financial results have been restated to consolidate symphoni  in which the company acquired a controlling interest during the company had previously accounted for its investment in symphoni under the equity method of accounting

the company evaluates segments based on income from operations 
since certain administrative and other operating expenses  income or loss from joint ventures  have not been allocated to the operating business segments  this basis is not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and it may not be comparable to other companies 
the following discussion compares our results of operations for the years ended december  and december   with our recast reporting segments  including our previously discontinued staffing services segment 
our revenues for increased million or to million from million for emplifi and ejiva revenues increased million and million  respectively  due to increased demand for their services 
mascot s revenues increased million due to increased demand for offshore services and the acquisition of certain contracts from emplifi 
our emerging eservices segment revenue increased million due to the acquisitions of irg  itiliti  and majority ownership interest in symphoni  as well as increased demand for these services 
revenues from the value services segment increased million  primarily due to the acquisition of cmi  which was purchased in november due to current market conditions surrounding the it services sector  we do not expect that value services revenues will increase 
our staffing services segment revenues decreased by million due to a slowdown in demand for our services within the segment 
our cost of revenues for increased million or to million from million for gross margin decreased to in from in all segments  with the exception of emerging eservices experienced a decline in gross margins during this decrease in gross margins are directly attributable to several factors including the implementation of a up to a four percent employee match feature in k retirement plan and increased payroll costs not offset by increased bill rates 
our emerging eservices segment s increased bill rates offset the payroll costs mentioned above resulting in an increase in gross margins 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses include all overhead costs that we incur that are not directly associated with our revenue generating consultants 
beginning in  we include expenses related to consultants non billable time as part of sg a expense  and have retroactively restated all prior periods to reflect this change 
sg a expenses include salaries  rent  recruiting costs  depreciation and amortization  legal and accounting fees  as well as communications and facilities costs 
our sg a expenses for increased million to million from million for our sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to from a year ago 
we incurred significant legal and accounting costs related to our reorganization effort 
we built management infrastructure at each of our operating companies and incurred additional salary and recruiting costs 
during  bad debt expense increased million from the prior year as a result of the write offs of several large amounts that were deemed uncollectible 
our facilities costs also increased due to the expansion of our operating companies into new offices and locations 
we anticipate that our sg a expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
we believe that we have the management structure in each segment necessary to sustain our growth in future periods 
during  we incurred costs of million for special items related to restructuring costs and goodwill impairment charges 
restructuring charges of million affected the majority of our reporting segments and consisted mainly of employee severance  lease breakage costs and certain business licensing fees that were no longer being utilized due to our restructuring 
we incurred charges of million for the write off of impaired goodwill relating to the acquisition of global resource management  inc in in  we incurred million of net special charges related to a winding down of an existing relationship with a large integrator client  partially offset by million in favorable settlements of outstanding claims that had been reserved 
the charges related to the winding down of the relationship consisted of salary  travel and relocation expenses associated with the consultants who had been assigned to the client s various projects 
equity in losses of affiliated companies for totaled million as compared to million in  and consisted of our share of net losses in our joint ventures  iprocess and pti  and our equity investments in airweb and vcampus 
the majority of our joint ventures and equity investments involve entities in the early stages of development  and we expect to incur losses in these companies until they are able to move beyond their respective start up phases 
we expect this income statement line item and income classification to be volatile  as we continue to invest in  and participate in joint ventures involving eservices companies 
minority interest  net increased to income of million in reflecting minority interest in the five majority owned operating subsidiaries mascot systems  itiliti  irg  symphoni and highgate ventures 
in  minority interest was income of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the initial public offering of a minority interest in mascot systems during other expense  net of other income  totaled million in  a million increase from other income  net of other expense  of million in significant changes included million of foreign currency translation adjustments on intercompany advances to our foreign subsidiaries  and interest expense in excess of interest earned in the amount of million related to the borrowings under our new pnc facility 
we recognized a pretax gain of million on the mascot systems initial public offering during we had no similar activity for our effective tax benefit for was  primarily due to the tax effect of non deductible goodwill amortization on our acquired subsidiaries and certain of our joint ventures 
in  our effective tax rate was  mainly due to our tax holiday in india and our tax exempt investment portfolio

mascot systems  our indian subsidiary  successfully completed an initial public offering in india in june  which generated million of proceeds  net of offering costs 
as part of indian governmental regulations  all proceeds from the offering must remain in india  thus we do not have direct access to these funds 
however  we believe that it is also in our best business interests that the funds stay in india as it is likely that mascot systems will have the ability to grow its business internally and through acquisitions without drawing on funds from igate capital corporation 
effective august  we entered into a new  million secured credit facility as amended  the new pnc facility with pnc bank  na pnc 
the new pnc facility replaced an existing million unsecured line of credit with pnc

the entire principal amount of the ge note will mature on july   and interest payments were made on the ge note on january   july   and january  the ge note is convertible at any time after july  through its maturity  at the option of the holder  into shares of the company s common stock  provided  however  that the portion of the ge note that may be converted into igate common stock may be limited if the revenues we generate by performing services for ge capital and certain of its affiliates fall below certain targets 
in conjunction with entering into the new pnc facility  we amended the ge note effective august  to provide ge capital with a more favorable conversion price and to provide for revised revenue targets 
as part of this amendment  we paid down million on the ge note 
at december   the ge conversion price was per share  which was above the fair market value of our common stock on that date 
the current outstanding principal amount is million 
on november   sunil wadhwani  co chairman and chief executive officer of igate  and ashok trivedi  co chairman and president of igate  each paid million to purchase  newly issued shares of common stock at a price of per share  the closing price per share as quoted on the nasdaq national market 
the million proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
as of december   subject to meeting certain operating requirements  we are obligated to pay cash earnouts related to prior acquisitions 
these earnout arrangements were agreed upon at the time we acquired our interests in these entities and will be paid if these companies meet certain performance benchmarks

in the upcoming year  our primary focus will be on our operating companies performance and cash flow  and at this time we do not plan to provide additional funds for investments and acquisitions by the venture fund during we still plan to take advantage of early stage opportunities in emerging eservices markets  and we recognize the need to have cash readily available for such opportunities 
we believe our operating expense needs for all of our existing operations can be met through a combination of operating cash flow  proceeds from the sale of some of our publicly traded investments  available cash balances and unused borrowings under the new pnc facility 
our ability to acquire and incubate new companies and to fund new ventures will be entirely dependent on the amount of excess cash generated from our operating companies  and the occurrence of any liquidity event
