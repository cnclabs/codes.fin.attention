item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
results of operations general revenues 
the company s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  the company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  the company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig previously stacked  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently 
the company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts 
such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract 
mobilization revenues  less costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another  are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract 
revenues from turnkey offshore drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met 
income is recognized on the completed contract method 
provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract 
operating income 
operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  the company may realize few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  the company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically charged to the operator under drilling contracts 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  the company may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
the company recognizes as operating expenses activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls  which meet certain criteria  that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
increased depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
years ended december  and comparative data relating to the company s revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below eliminations offset i dayrate revenues earned when the company s rigs are utilized in its integrated services and ii intercompany expenses charged to rig operations 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed

revenues 
revenues from high specification floaters during the year ended december  decreased million from approximately million of the decline in revenues resulted from lower operating dayrates compared to the average operating dayrate for high specification floaters during the year ended december  was  per day compared to  per day during the year ended december  revenues from high specification floaters were also lower in by approximately million due to the mobilizations of the ocean alliance from the north sea to west africa and the ocean clipper from the gulf of mexico to brazil 
the decline in revenues was partially offset by approximately million resulting from improved utilization during utilization for the company s high specification floaters was during compared to during the company s drillship  the ocean clipper  operated for most of under its three year contract offshore brazil 
during most of  this rig was in a shipyard for upgrades and repairs associated with this contract 
also contributing to the improved utilization in was the operation of the ocean valiant  which was in the shipyard during part of for stability enhancements and other repairs 
the ocean quest  which was stacked during part of  but worked all of  partially offset these utilization improvements in contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended december  decreased million from costs for the ocean valiant in were million lower than in primarily due to expenses of million incurred for repairs of the rig while it was in the shipyard during part of costs of million for the mobilization of the ocean alliance from the north sea to angola also contributed to the decrease 
the decline in costs was partially offset by higher contract drilling expenses of million incurred by the ocean clipper which began operating in under a three year contract offshore brazil 
during most of  the ocean clipper was in a shipyard for upgrades and repairs which were capitalized 
also offsetting the decrease in costs were expenses of million associated with the mobilization of the ocean alliance from angola to brazil 
other semisubmersibles 
revenues 
revenues from other semisubmersibles during the year ended december  decreased million from approximately million of the decline in revenues resulted from lower operating dayrates compared to the average operating dayrate for the company s other semisub mersibles was  per day during the year ended december  compared to  per day during the year ended december  in addition  revenues decreased by approximately million resulting from lower utilization compared to utilization for the company s other semisubmersibles during the year ended december  was compared to during the year ended december  the ocean epoch underwent an upgrade of its water depth capabilities and variable deckload and was idle during most of but worked for most of the ocean rover  ocean endeavor  ocean guardian and ocean voyager were idle during most of but worked during most of the ocean baroness  which was cold stacked during the first half of and then mobilized to singapore for an upgrade to high specification capabilities  worked for most of the first half of see capital resources 
the decline in utilization was partially offset by the ocean general and ocean winner  which worked all of  but were idle most of contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended december  decreased million from this decline resulted partially from a million reduction of cost as a result of the ocean baroness  which was cold stacked during the first half of and then mobilized to singapore for an upgrade  but worked for most of the first half of see capital resources 
contract drilling expense was further reduced by million as a result of stacking the ocean epoch in late and million associated with mandatory inspections and repairs of the ocean new era in costs in also decreased by million from due to the inspection and repair of the ocean winner and its mobilization from the gulf of mexico to brazil in cost increases in which were partially offsetting included higher operating costs of million in for the ocean general  which was stacked throughout  and million associated with the mandatory inspection and repairs of the ocean lexington in jack ups 
revenues 
revenues from jack ups during the year ended december  increased million from approximately million of the increase in revenues resulted from improvements in utilization compared to utilization of the company s jack ups during the year ended december  was compared to during the year ended december  in addition  revenues increased approximately million due to higher operating dayrates compared to the average operating dayrate for the company s jack ups was  per day during the year ended december  compared to  per day during the year ended december  the revenue improvement in was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of million from the ocean scotian  which was sold in january but worked for most of contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for jack ups during the year ended december  was million higher than for the same period in an increase of million was due to rigs returning to work in  which were idle for all or part of in addition  contract drilling expense was million higher in due to major repairs to the ocean heritage 
higher contract drilling expense in was partially offset by a decrease of million due to the january sale of the ocean scotian 
integrated services 
revenues and contract drilling expense for integrated services decreased as a result of the differences in number  type and magnitude of projects during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in other 
other contract drilling expense of million for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in this increase resulted primarily from higher expenditures during for crew training programs and various other non recurring charges 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  increased million from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from higher depreciation for the ocean clipper  ocean general  ocean concord and ocean king  which completed various upgrades in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  depreciation expense was up due to expenditures associated with the company s continuing rig enhancement program 
this increase was partially offset by reduced depreciation in due to the january sale of the ocean scotian and a decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from adjustments to goodwill related to tax benefits not previously recognized for the excess of tax deductible goodwill over the book amount 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased million from million for the year ended december  higher expenses in were primarily due to an increase in legal and personnel costs 
expenses in also included costs associated with the company s participation in the subsea mudlift drilling joint industry project 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  gain on sale of assets in included the sale of the company s jack up drilling rig  ocean scotian  for million in cash resulting in a gain of million million after tax 
the rig had been cold stacked offshore the netherlands prior to the sale 
interest income

interest expense 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  increased million from million for interest costs in were million higher than in primarily as a result of the issuance of the debentures on june  this amount was partially offset by a million increase in interest capitalized for the conversion of the ocean confidence and the deepwater upgrade of the ocean baroness 
interest cost capitalized in was million compared to million in see liquidity and capital resources 
other income 
other income of million for the year ended december  increased million from other expense of million for the year ended december  in  a pre tax impairment loss of million was recorded as the result of the decline in fair market value  judged to be other than temporary  in the company s investment in equity securities 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for this change resulted primarily from a decrease of million in the company s income before income tax expense

revenues 
revenues from high specification floaters during the year ended december  decreased million from this decrease resulted primarily from i a million reduction in revenues from the ocean valiant due to lower utilization while the rig was in the shipyard for stability enhancements and other repairs performed during and ii a million decrease due to rig downtime associated with the upgrade of and repairs performed in on the ocean clipper 
revenues were also reduced by approximately million due to lower operating dayrates in compared to and reduced by million due to rig downtime associated with the mandatory inspection and repairs of the ocean america 
the average operating dayrate for high specification floaters was  per day during  compared to  per day during these decreases were partially offset by higher revenues of approximately million from the ocean victory  which was in the shipyard during part of for repairs required as a result of the february engine room fire 
the decrease in revenue was also partially offset by an increase of approximately million from mobilization revenues for the ocean alliance to locations offshore west africa during and million from mobilization revenues for the ocean clipper from the gulf of mexico to brazil in contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended december  increased million from this increase resulted in part from an increase of million for repairs performed on the ocean valiant  which was in the shipyard for part of also contributing to this increase was million associated with costs for the mandatory inspection and repairs of the ocean america and million due to the capitalization of costs associated with shipyard repairs on the ocean victory 
other semisubmersibles 
revenues 
revenues from other semisubmersibles during the year ended december  decreased million from in part  revenues decreased million due to a decline in utilization in compared to and million due to rigs removed from service in late and in addition  revenues were reduced by million due to rig downtime during for mandatory inspections and repairs of the ocean new era  the ocean yatzy  the ocean concord  the ocean winner  and the ocean guardian 
also contributing to the decrease in revenues was a million decline from lower operating dayrates in compared to the average operating dayrate for other semisubmersibles was  per day in  compared to  per day in these decreases were partially offset by revenue improvements in of approximately million from nine other rigs which were undergoing mandatory inspections during contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended december  decreased million from this decrease resulted primarily from expense reductions of approximately million due to a decline in utilization and from rigs that were idle for all or part of contract drilling expense also decreased by approximately million due to fewer mandatory inspections and repairs performed during compared to partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in costs of million associated with the mobilization of the ocean winner from the gulf of mexico to brazil during the first half of jack ups 
revenues 
revenues from jack ups during the year ended december  decreased million from this decrease was primarily due to reductions in revenues of million from lower operating dayrates and million from decreased utilization as well as the removal of rigs from service in late and the first quarter of the average operating dayrate for jack ups was  per day during compared to  per day in contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for jack ups during the twelve months ended december  decreased million for the same period in this decrease resulted primarily from expense reductions for rigs that were removed from service in late and the first quarter of integrated services 
revenues and contract drilling expense for integrated services increased primarily due to four turnkey wells completed during in  the company performed primarily project management services on a dayrate basis

income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for this change resulted primarily from a decrease of million in the company s income before income tax expense 
outlook during  oil and natural gas prices remained significantly above historical averages 
however  market recovery for various classes of equipment within the offshore drilling industry was inconsistent as oil producers waited to see if the high level of product prices would continue 
the company believes that current expectations are for higher than average product prices to persist as world energy demand is increasing and short term oil supplies are below historical averages 
the growth in the offshore drilling industry  anticipated because of these favorable market fundamentals  is dependent on confidence by the company s customers that current levels of oil and gas prices will be sustained 
utilization and dayrates for the company s domestic jack up market improved significantly in as independent producers acted quickly to take advantage of the high natural gas prices which prevailed throughout the year 
although the improvement in the jack up market leveled off during the fourth quarter of  it remains strong 
the company s outlook for this market is for continued strength  especially if the recovery of the international jack up market creates a tighter supply of jack ups in the gulf of mexico 
during  there was increased interest in the company s deepwater high specification rig fleet with both utilization and dayrates increasing 
the company believes that prospects are good for further improvement in this market  as most recent dayrates are greater than rates under current contracts 
most of the existing contracts are for short term  well to well work and the company anticipates upward pressure on rates as these existing contracts are renewed or replaced 
for the company s domestic other semisubmersible rig fleet  the market began to experience growth in the latter half of with both dayrates and utilization increasing 
currently  all of the domestic marketed rigs in this class are working or have commitments 
if the backlog for these rigs continues to build  the company expects further increases in dayrates 
the company believes that the international markets are also strengthening for all classes of equipment 
dayrates are increasing and that trend is expected to continue into the second half of the year 
all three of the company s rigs located in the north sea have recently committed for work at dayrates that are well above their previously contracted dayrates 
five of the company s six rigs operating in brazil are committed under long term contracts ranging from months to approximately three years 
historically  the offshore drilling industry has been highly competitive and cyclical  and the company cannot predict the extent to which the current favorable conditions may continue 
however  many oil and gas companies have increased planned expenditures for and other current indicators appear to be positive 
the company is currently cautiously optimistic about the near term future of the offshore drilling industry and its place in it 
liquidity at december   the company s cash and marketable securities totaled million  up from million at december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased by million to million  as compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in operating income and various other related changes  primarily in accounts receivable and taxes payable 
investing activities used million of cash during the year ended december   compared to million in cash usage for capital expenditures during of million was primarily due to the conversion of the ocean confidence  and to a lesser extent  upgrades of the ocean baroness and ocean epoch 
see capital resources 
cash usage increased million primarily due to the company s investment in marketable securities purchased with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the debentures 
a million increase in cash was provided by proceeds from the sale of assets  primarily the sale of the ocean scotian in january cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million cash used in financing activities in sources of financing during consisted primarily of the company s issuance of the debentures  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
the company intends to use the net proceeds generated by the issuance of the debentures for general corporate purposes 
the debentures were issued in june at a discount from their value at maturity on june  the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity  unless previously redeemed  into the company s common stock at a fixed conversion rate of shares of common stock per debentures  subject to adjustments in certain events 
the company will not pay interest on the debentures prior to maturity unless it elects to convert the debentures to interest bearing debentures upon the occurrence of certain tax events 
the company has the right to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  after june  for a price equal to the issuance price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of redemption 
holders have the right to require the company to repurchase the debentures on the fifth  tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of issuance at the accreted value through the date of repurchase 
the company may pay such repurchase price with either cash or shares of the company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
on march   the company announced its decision to redeem  on april   all of its outstanding convertible subordinated notes due the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  together with interest accrued to but not including the redemption date 
these notes are convertible on or before the close of business on april  into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
if none of the notes outstanding are converted into common stock prior to april   the redemption of all of the outstanding notes would result in a charge of million after tax and reported as an extraordinary loss in the second quarter of additional sources of financing during included a lease leaseback agreement the agreement  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
the agreement between the company and a european bank was entered into in december the agreement provided for the company to lease the ocean alliance  one of the company s high specification semisubmersible drilling rigs  to the bank for a lump sum payment of million plus an origination fee of million and for the bank to then sub lease the rig back to the company 
under the agreement  which has a five year term  the company is to make five annual payments of million 
this financing arrangement has an effective interest rate of and is an unsecured subordinated obligation of the company 
also contributing to cash provided by financing activities in were premiums received of million for the august sale of put options covering  common shares 
the options gave the holders the right to require the company to repurchase shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share at anytime prior to expiration through february the company had the option to settle in cash or shares of its common stock 
all of these options were unexercised and expired by the end of february on february   the company received premiums of million for the sale of put options covering  common shares 
the options give the holders the right to require the company to repurchase shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share at anytime prior to expiration in february the company has the option to settle in cash or shares of common stock 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from the purchase of treasury stock and from dividends paid to stockholders 
depending on market conditions  the company may  from time to time  purchase shares of its common stock in the open market or otherwise 
during  the company purchased million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or at an average cost of per share 
the company did not purchase any of its common stock during effective december   the company retired all  shares of its treasury stock at an aggregate cost of million 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other sources of liquidity include the company s million short term revolving credit agreement with a us bank 
the agreement provides for borrowings at various interest rates and varying commitment fees dependent upon public credit ratings 
in april  the credit agreement was amended to revise these interest rates and commitment fees 
the company intends to use the facility primarily for letters of credit that the company must post  from time to time  for bid and performance guarantees required in certain parts of the world 
the agreement contains certain financial and other covenants and provisions that must be maintained by the company for compliance 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and the company was in compliance with each of the covenants and provisions 
the company has the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately million in debt  equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement 
in addition  the company may issue  from time to time  up to eight million shares of common stock  which shares are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement upon effectiveness of an amendment thereto reflecting the effect of the two for one stock split declared in july  in connection with one or more acquisitions by the company of securities or assets of other businesses 
the company believes it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements in the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and continuing rig enhancements  and working capital requirements 
capital resources cash required to meet the company s capital commitments is determined by evaluating rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating the company s continuing rig enhancement program  including water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
it is management s opinion that operating cash flows and the company s cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments  however  periodic assessments will be made based on industry conditions 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses  or for general corporate purposes 
the company s ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on the company s results of operations  its current financial condition  current market conditions  and other factors beyond its control 
during the year ended december   the company expended million  including capitalized interest expense  for rig upgrades  primarily for the conversion of the ocean confidence 
also included in this amount was approximately million expended for variable deckload and water depth capability upgrades on the ocean epoch 
the company expects to spend approximately million for rig upgrade capital expenditures during which are primarily costs associated with the deepwater upgrade of the ocean baroness 
included in this amount is approximately million for accommodations and stability enhancement upgrades on the ocean nomad 
the significant upgrade of the company s semisubmersible  the ocean baroness  to high specification capabilities will be an enhanced version of the company s previous victory class upgrades 
the upgrade includes the following enhancements capability for operation in  foot water depths  approximately  metric tons variable deckload  a  psi blow out prevention system  and riser with a multiplex control system 
additional features including a high capacity deck crane  significantly enlarged cellar deck area and a foot by foot moon pool will provide enhanced subsea completion and development capabilities 
water depths in excess of  feet should be achievable utilizing preset taut leg mooring systems on a case by case basis 
the initial estimated cost for the deepwater upgrade of the ocean baroness is approximately million with an expected delivery date of february during the year ended december   the company expended million for the deepwater upgrade of the ocean baroness 
the conversion of the ocean confidence from an accommodation vessel to a semisubmersible drilling unit was completed and the rig was accepted by the customer on january  at which time it began a five year drilling program in the gulf of mexico 
the following enhancements were made to the drilling unit the capability for operation in  foot water depths  approximately  metric tons variable deckload  a  psi blow out prevention system  and four mud pumps to complement the existing class iii dynamic positioning system 
the net cost of conversion for this rig was approximately million 
future revenues to be generated by the ocean confidence under its five year contract are estimated to be million including the effect of the million reduction that resulted from the late delivery of the rig 
additional revenue reductions could occur during the first two wells under the drilling contract based on the nature of any downtime 
the rig was evaluated for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  and no instance of impairment was noted 
during the year ended december   the company expended million in association with its continuing rig enhancement program and to meet other corporate requirements 
these expenditures included purchases of king post cranes  anchor chain  riser  and other drilling equipment 
the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures associated with its continuing rig enhancement program and other corporate requirements 
the company continues to consider transactions  which include  but are not limited to  the purchase of existing rigs  construction of new rigs and the acquisition of other companies engaged in contract drilling or related businesses 
certain of these potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business 
in general  however  these opportunities have been related in some manner to the company s existing operations 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such an agreement in the future and such acquisition could result in a material expansion of its existing operations or result in the company entering a new line of business 
some of the potential acquisitions considered by the company could  if completed  result in the expenditure of a material amount of funds or the issuance of a material amount of debt or equity securities 
integrated services the company s wholly owned subsidiary  dots  from time to time  selectively engages in drilling services pursuant to turnkey or modified turnkey contracts under which dots agrees to drill a well to a specified depth for a fixed price 
in such cases  dots generally is not entitled to payment unless the well is drilled to the specified depth 
profitability of the contract is dependent upon its ability to keep expenses within the estimates used in determining the contract price 
drilling a well under a turnkey contract therefore typically requires a greater cash commitment by the company and exposes the company to risks of potential financial losses that generally are substantially greater than those that would ordinarily exist when drilling under a conventional dayrate contract 
dots also offers a portfolio of drilling services including overall project management  extended well tests  and completion operations 
during  dots contributed operating income of million to the company s consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of four turnkey projects in the gulf of mexico  one international turnkey project and integrated services provided in aberdeen  scotland 
during  dots contributed operating income of million to the company s consolidated results of operations primarily from four turnkey wells completed in the gulf of mexico and integrated services in aberdeen  scotland 
other currency risk 
certain of the company s subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency 
currency environments in which the company has material business operations include the uk  australia  brazil and indonesia 
the company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the company s estimated operating costs payable in local currency and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
because of this strategy  the company has minimized its unhedged net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
at present  only contracts covering the company s six rigs currently operating in brazil are payable both in us dollars and the local currency 
the company has not hedged its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between us dollars and the local currencies in the uk  australia or indonesia for operating costs payable in these currencies  although it may seek to do so in the future 
currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity 
when the company ceases its operations in a currency environment  the accumulated adjustments are recognized currently in results of operations 
the effect on results of operations from these translation gains and losses has not been material and they are not expected to have a significant effect in the future 
accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amended certain provisions of sfas no 
to clarify four areas causing difficulties in implementation 
the amendment included expanding the normal purchase and sale exemption for supply contracts  permitting the offsetting of certain intercompany foreign currency derivatives and thus reducing the number of third party derivatives  permitting hedge accounting for foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and redefining interest rate risk to reduce sources of ineffectiveness 
the company adopted sfas no
