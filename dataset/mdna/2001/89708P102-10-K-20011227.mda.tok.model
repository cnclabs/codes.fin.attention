the company has historically financed its growth in sales and the resulting increase in inventory and receivables through a combination of operating cash flow and borrowings under its senior credit facility 
consistent with industry practice  the company is often required to post let ters of credit when placing an order with certain international manufacturers 
the company s revolving credit line the facility provides for borrowings of up to million  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
borrowings under the facili ty bear interest at variable rates at september  and are secured by substantially all of the compa ny s domestic assets 
the facility matures in june as of september   an additional million was available for borrowings under the facility 
on may   the company entered into a real estate loan real estate loan agreement secured by the company s distribution center  cutting facility  and administrative o ffices in tampa  florida 
the real estate loan was used to refinance million outstanding on the company s previous real estate loan and to finance up to million of the costs related to an expansion of the comp any s tampa  florida distribution facility 
in march  the real estate loan was converted to a secured ter m loan 
principal and interest are due monthly on the refinanced amount and the loan bears interest at the d ay london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin 
the principal payments are based o n a year amortization with all outstanding principal due on or before may  borrowings under the real estate loan bear interest at a rate of d ay libor plus an applicable margin at september

under the terms of the indenture underlying the notes  the company is paying semi annual interest at the rate of through june  at which time the entire principal amount is due

during fiscal  the company amended the terms of the facility to adjust certain of the financial covenants 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants under its credit agreements 
pursuant to two separate factoring agreements the factoring agreements  the company factors substantially all of its accounts receivable 
the factoring agreements p rovide that the factor will pay the company an amount equal to the gross amount of the company s accounts rece ivable from customers  reduced by certain offsets  including among other things  discounts  returns  and a comm ission payable by the company to the factor 
the commission averages of the gross amount factored

impact of recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statem ent of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations statement no 
and statement of fina ncial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement no 

statement no 
prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method for business combinations completed after june   and requires the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
statement no 
is effectiv e for any business combination that is completed after june  statement no 
includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets would be tested for impairment  and any impairment charge resultin g from the initial application of statement no 
would be classified as a cumulative change in accountin g principle 
statement no 
is effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after december  the acquisition of duck head in august was accounted for in ac cordance with statements no 
the company also adopted statement no 
on september  and will no longer amortize its remaining goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  but will test them for impairment on a periodic basis 
the provisions of statement no 
also require the completion of a trans itional impairment test within six months of adoption  with any impairment identified treated as a cumulativ e effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company intends to complete this transitional impairment test ing during fiscal application of the non amortization provisions of statement no 
are expected to resul t in an increase to net income after tax of approximately  per diluted share per year 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been m oderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability i n the company s cost of sales 
in prior years  the company has been able to adjust its selling prices and impr ove efficiencies to substantially offset increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and the company do es not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the compan y s business will not be materially adversely affected by inflation in the future 
risk factors affecting the company s business and prospects our financial success is linked to that of our customers  commitment to our products and our ability to satisfy and maintain our customers 
our financial success is directly related to the success of our cus tomers and the willingness of our customers  in particular our major customers  to continue buying our prod ucts 
sales to the company s five largest customers represented approximately  and of net sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to wal mart including sam s club  the nation s largest chain of wholesale clubs  accounted for approximately  and of net sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
sal es to our customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and resc heduling by the customer or by us 
accordingly  the number of unfilled orders at any given time is not indicativ e of the number that will eventually be shipped 
if we cannot timely fill our customers orders  our relationship s with our customers may suffer  and this could have a material adverse effect on us  especially if the rela tionship is with a major customer 
furthermore  if any of our major customers experiences a significant downturn in its business  or fails to remain committed to our programs or brands  then these customers may reduce or di scontinue purchases from us  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

we are subject to changes in the apparel industry  including changing fashion t rends and consumer preferences 
the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical var iations 
a recession in the general economy  or any other events or uncertainties that discourage consumers from spending  could have a significant effect on our sales and profitability 
we believe that our success is la rgely dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design  styling and production of our products 
if we cannot gauge consumer needs and fashion tren ds and respond appropriately  then consumers may not purchase our products and this would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
various apparel retailers  some of which are or have been our customers  have in recent years experienced financial problems 
many have been subject to bankruptcy  restruct uring  or liquidation  while others have consolidated ownership and centralized buying decisions 
this increa ses our risk of extending credit to these retailers  and may lead us to reduce or discontinue business with such customers  or to assume more credit risk relating to their receivables 
any one of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with manufacturers and retailers in the highly competitive apparel i ndustry 
we compete with many apparel manufacturers  including brand name and private label producers and retailers who have  or may have  the capability to develop their product and source their products internally 
our products are also in competition with many designer and non designer pr oduct lines 
our products compete primarily on the basis of price  quality  and our ability to satisfy custom er orders in a timely manner 
our failure to satisfy any one of these factors could cause our customers to purch ase products from our competitors 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financia l  manufacturing and distribution resources than we do 
if manufacturers or retailers increase their compe tition with us  or if our current competitors become more successful in competing with us  we could experienc e material adverse effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition

we may experience delays or other difficulties in implementing our operating pl ans for duck head 
we may experience unanticipated conditions and contingencies in connection with implementing our operating plans for duck head 
as a result  we may not achieve projected reve nue and earnings for fiscal and thereafter  and we may have difficulties achieving anticipated cost savings re lated to the acquisition  including reductions in staff and the consolidation of facilities 
the success of th e acquisition of duck head is also dependent upon the continued acceptance of duck head s existing and new produc ts by its major customers  and the financial strength of duck head s major customers 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials we use could increase our cost of sales and reduce our ability to meet our customers demands 
the principal fabrics used in our apparel consist of cotton  wool  synthetic and blended fabrics 
the price we pay for these fabrics is mostly dependent on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them  namely cotton  wool  rayon and polyester 
depending on a number of factors  including crop yields and weather patterns  the market price of these raw materials may fluctuate signi ficantly 
some of our suppliers are experiencing financial difficulties 
this increases the risk that we will be unable to obtain raw materials at the price or quality or with the ease that we have historically obtained the m 
moreover  only a limited number of suppliers are available to supply the fabrics at the level of quality we require 
if we have to procure fabrics from sources other than our current suppliers  the quality of the fab ric may be significantly different from that obtained from our current suppliers 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of the fabrics or raw materials could increase our cost of sales and reduce our abili ty to meet our customers demands 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass along to our customers all  or any portion of  any increases in the prices paid for the fabrics used in the manufacture of our products 
see item business operations 
we depend upon independent manufacturers in the production of our apparel 
we use independent manufacturers to assemble or produce a substa ntial portion of our products 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the assembly or productio n of goods ordered and to maintain manufacturing capacity 
we do not exert direct control over these independent manufacturers  however  so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
we generally do not have long term contracts with any of these independent manufacturers 
as a result  we cannot be assured of an uninterrupted supply of our product from our independent manufacturers 
if there is an interruption  we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers because such substitutes may not be av ailable  or they may not be able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality  at an acceptab le price or on a timely basis 
see item business operations 
our ability to successfully conduct assembly and production operations in fac ilities in foreign countries depends on many factors beyond our control 
during fiscal  a significant portion of our products were a ssembled or produced by independent manufacturers in the dominican republic and mexico 
it is possible that we will experience difficulties with these independent manufacturers  including reduced production capacity  fai lure to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs as more fully discussed above 
also  using fo reign manufacturers requires us to order products further in advance to account for transportation time 
if we o verestimate customer demand  we may have to hold goods in inventory  and we may be unable to sell these goods at the same margins as we have in the past 
on the other hand  if we underestimate customer demand  we may not be ab le to fill orders in time 
other problems we may encounter by using foreign manufacturers i nclude  but are not limited to work stoppages  transportation delays and interruptions  delays and interruptions from natural disasters  political instability  involvement in wars or other similar conflicts such as terrori st attacks  economic disruptions  expropriation  nationalization  imposition of tariffs  imposition of import and export controls  and changes in government policies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk 
in the past  mo st of our contracts to have goods assembled or produced in foreign countries were negotiated in united states dollars 
if the value of the united states dollar decreases  then the price that we pay for our products could i ncrease  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to our customers

to acquire savane we incurred a substantial amount of debt that will re quire successful future operating performance and financial results and that imposes important limitations on us 
to finance our acquisition of savane  we increased our outstanding indebtedness and our leverage 
the degree to which we are leveraged will have important consequences  including th e following o a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedic ated to the payment of principal and and interest on our debt  o our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for worki ng capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired  o our leverage may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures  o our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities may be limited  and o our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in relation to less leveraged competitors 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future operating performance and financial results  which will be subject in part to factors beyond our cont rol 
although we believe that our cash flow will be adequate to meet our interest and principal payments  the re can be no assurance that we will generate earnings in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges 
if we are unable to generate earnings in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges and are unable to borrow fund s from existing credit facilities or from other sources  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of o ur existing debt or to sell all or a portion of our assets  either of which may be at terms that are unfavorable to us 
there can be no assurance that a refinancing would be possible  nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that we could realize therefrom 
in addition  the terms of the debt restrict our ability to sell assets and the use of the proceeds therefrom 
if for any reason  including a shortfall in anticipated operating r esults or proceeds from asset sales  we were unable to meet our debt service obligations  we would be in defaul t under the terms of our existing debt 
in the event of such a default  some of our lenders could elect to decl are certain debt to be immediately due and payable  including accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  such lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the debt  which consists of substantially all of our cu rrent and future personal property 
default on our senior debt obligation could result in a default under our other debt or result in bankruptcy 
the terms of our existing debt place significant restrictions on our abilit y to pursue financial and strategic opportunities 
the terms of our existing debt contain a number of significant co venants that  among other things  restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional debt  repay othe r debt  pay dividends  make certain investments or acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  engage in me rgers or consolidations  engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates  and engage in certain co rporate activities 
there can be no assurance that these restrictions will not advers ely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities th at may be in our best interest 
in addition  the terms of our existing debt require us to maintain compliance w ith certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond our cont rol 
a breach of any of these terms or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the terms of the company s debt and the acceleration of all or a portion of such debt  or result in bankruptcy 
we may not be able to successfully identify  acquire and profitably operate com panies and businesses that are compatible with our operations 
we continually evaluate the potential acquisition of other comple mentary companies and brands 
this includes our efforts to enter into new agreements to license additional b rands 
our search may not yield any complementary companies or brands  and even if we do find a suitable acqui sition we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund the purchase 
we may not be able to successfull y integrate the operations of any company that we acquire into our own operations and we cannot assure you that the acquired operation will achieve the results we expected 
for example  the acquired business may not achieve revenues  profits or operational efficiencies at the same levels as our existing operations or at the lev els that it achieved prior to our acquiring it 
the success of any acquisition will also depend upon our abil ity to retain or hire and then train key personnel 
acquiring another company or business may also have negative effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition because our officers and directors may foc us their attention on completing or integrating the acquisition  or because other resources may be diverted to fulfilling the needs of the acquisition 
we compete with other companies who have greater resources than we do for the opportunities to buy other companies and businesses and to expand our operations 
as a result  e ven if we do identify a suitable acquisition  we may lose the acquisition to a competitor who offers a more a ttractive purchase price 
in such event  we may incur significant costs in pursuing an acquisition without succes s 
our use of our trademarks and trade dress may subject us to claims of infringem ent by other parties 
we use many trademarks in our business  some of which have been regi stered with the united states patent and trademark office 
we believe these registered and common law trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our competitive position and to our success 
the use and regist ration of our trademarks and the use of our trade dress are challenged periodically 
despite our efforts to the contrary  our trademarks and proprietary rights may violate the proprietary rights of others 
if any of our trademarks or other proprietary rights wer e found to violate the proprietary rights of others  or were subjected to some other challenge  we cannot assu re you that we would be permitted to continue using these trademarks or other proprietary rights 
furthermor e  if we were sued for alleged infringement of another s proprietary rights  the party claiming infringeme nt might have greater resources than we do to pursue its claims  and we could be forced to incur substantial costs to defend the litigation 
moreover  if the party claiming infringement prevails  we could be forced to pay significant damages  or to enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party 
pursuant to licensing agreements  we also have exclusive rights to use trademarks owned by other companies in promoting  distributing and selling their products 
we ha ve periodically been involved in litigation regarding these licensing agreements 
we cannot assure you tha t these licensing agreements will remain in effect or that they will be renewed 
in addition  any future dispu tes concerning these licenses may cause us to incur significant litigation costs or force us to suspend use o f the trademarks

our products that are imported into the united states are subject to certain re strictions and tariffs 
most of our import operations are subject to bilateral textile agree ments between the united states and a number of other countries 
these agreements establish quotas for the a mount and type of goods that can be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements a llow the united states  in certain circumstances  to impose restraints at any time on the importation of additional or new categories of merchandise 
future bilateral textile agreements may also contain similar restraints 
excluding the countries covered under cbtpa and nafta  our imported products are also subject to u nited states customs duties 
the united states and the countries in which we manufacture our products may adjus t quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions currently in effect 
there are no assurances that any adjust ments would benefit us 
these same countries may also impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions 
furthermore  the united states may bar imports of products that are found to be made by convicts  or forced or i ndentured labor 
the united states may also withdraw the most favored nation status of certain countries  whi ch could result in the imposition of higher tariffs on products imported from those countries 
all of these cha nges could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest r ates as it pertains to the company s borrowings under the facility and the real estate loan 
as of september   the company s interest rates on borrowings under the facility and real estate loan were and  res pectively 
if the interest rates on the company s borrowings average basis points more in fiscal than th ey did in fiscal  the company s interest expense would increase and income before income taxes would de crease by  this amount is determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on the company s borrowing cost without consideration for other factors such as actions ma nagement might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is intended to maintain the fixed variable mix of the interest rate on the real estate loan within defin ed parameters
