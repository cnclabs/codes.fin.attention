item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development and production of oil and gas from properties located in the united states and poland 
through the end of  all of our production revenue has been from our united states producing properties 
in the western united states  we produce oil from fields in montana and nevada and have an oilfield services company in northern montana and oil and gas exploration prospects in several western states 
we conduct substantially all of our exploration and development activities in poland jointly with others and  accordingly  recorded amounts for our activities in poland reflect only our proportionate interest in these activities 
our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year based on the factors discussed in risk factors and on other factors such as our exploratory and development drilling success 
therefore  the results of any one year may not be indicative of future results 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are considered not to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net revenues determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
we have reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our results of operations or financial position 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production segment  or e p  and the oilfield services segment 
mining  which consisted solely of gold exploration on our sudety project area in poland  has been discontinued and is excluded from the following discussion 
depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  and general and administrative costs  or g a  directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
amortization of deferred compensation  interest income  other income  officer loan impairment and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
a comparison of the results of operations by business segment and information regarding nonsegmented items for the years ended december   and follows exploration and production segment a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil revenues  average oil prices  production volumes and lifting costs per barrel for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table year ended december  oil revenues    percent change versus prior year average oil price percent change versus prior year production volumes bbls    percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel percent change versus prior year lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during these three years  our oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices  the degree of maintenance performed and declining production rates attributable to the natural production declines of our producing properties 
gain on sale of property interests 
there was no gain on sale of property interests for the years ended december  and we recognized a gain on sale of property interests of  during the year ended december  during  apache paid us  in initial cash consideration relating to its participation in our carpathian project area  which was offset by  of associated costs 
the amount of gain on sale of property interests will continue to vary from year to year  depending on the timing of completed deals and the amount of up front cash consideration  if any 
lease operating costs 
our lease operating costs consist of normal recurring lease operating expenses and production taxes 
lease operating costs were million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and  respectively  per barrel of oil produced 
lease operating expenses were million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we plugged and abandoned ten inactive wells at a total cost of approximately  on the cut bank sand unit  our principal producing property  and incurred substantially more maintenance and repair costs as we completed work that had been postponed due to low oil prices during prior years 
as a result  lifting costs per barrel were during  an increase of as compared to the same period on during and  we performed only routine maintenance on our producing properties and deferred workovers in an effort to control operating costs due to low oil prices 
lifting costs per barrel were relatively flat during and  amounting to and per barrel  respectively 
production taxes were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of oil revenues  respectively 
during  the state of montana passed legislation to reduce the production tax rate to as low as for stripper oil wells 
the legislation also included a provision whereby the production tax rate would increase to as much as for stripper wells if the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil  or wti  exceeded per barrel during any calendar quarter 
in the event the average price of wti exceeded per barrel  the higher tax rate would apply to all production during the then current calendar quarter 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the average price of wti exceeded per barrel  resulting in a higher effective production tax rate during  as compared to during  production taxes decreased to an average of approximately of annual oil revenues  as compared to during  primarily due to the reduction in the production tax rate on stripper wells in montana and the average price of wti not exceeding per barrel during any quarter of the change in the amount of production taxes from year to year is directly attributable to the combination of fluctuating of oil prices  production tax rate changes and the amount of oil produced 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and per barrel  respectively 
the increase in dd a expense of per barrel during  as compared to the same period of  is primarily attributed to a  barrel decrease in the amount of estimated proved reserves as of december   as compared to december  the decrease in dd a expense of during  as compared to the december   is directly attributable to the million write down of our domestic proved developed oil and gas properties during  which resulted in a substantially lower depreciable property basis during  as compared to domestic proved property impairment 
there were no domestic proved property impairments for the years ended december  or for the year ended december   we incurred a domestic proved developed property impairment of million due to low oil prices experienced during  coupled with forecasted continuation of depressed oil prices and our decision to focus our limited resources on poland 
as of december   the estimated net present value for our domestic proved properties was approximately  consisting solely of proved developed reserves 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the long lived assets to be disposed of  we recorded total impairment expense of million for the year ended december   which represented the difference between the net book value of our domestic proved developed properties and the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis  as of december  exploration costs 
our exploration costs consist of geological and geophysical costs  or g g  exploratory dry holes and nonproducing leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
g g costs of  and  incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively  relate to our discontinued gold exploration in poland  which is excluded from the following discussion of each component of exploration costs 
g g costs were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we spent approximately million on acquiring d seismic data in the fences project area  approximately  on acquiring d seismic data on the lublin basin  pomeranian and warsaw west project areas and granted stock options valued at approximately  to a polish consultant 
during  we spent approximately  reprocessing d seismic data on the pomeranian and warsaw west project areas  granted stock options valued at approximately  to a polish consultant and spent approximately  evaluating potential property acquisitions from pogc 
during  we incurred approximately  of cost relating to our share of the lublin project area d seismic data acquisition program with apache and  relating to a geological and geophysical study 
from january   through december   we spent an average amount of approximately million annually relating to analyzing seismic data and the wages and associated expenses for employees and consultants directly engaged in geological and geophysical activities 
subject to available funding  g g costs are expected to continue at current or higher levels as we further our exploratory efforts in poland 
exploratory dry hole costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we drilled the wilga and wilga wells near our wilga discovery on the lublin basin project area  both of which were subsequently determined to be exploratory dry holes costing a net amount of million and  respectively  after apache covered one half of our share of costs to drill the wilga and wilga wells under terms of the apache exploration program 
during  we participated in drilling three exploratory dry holes in poland 
two of these wells  the siedliska and witkow  were carried exploratory wells under the apache exploration program 
as such  apache covered all of our pro rata share of costs for both wells 
we retained and paid for a interest in the andrychow well  an exploratory dry hole on the carpathian project area  which cost  on the lachowice farm in  we spent  to recomplete one shut in well and test another shut in well  both of which were noncommercial 
also  during  we spent  associated with the gladysze a  an exploratory dry hole drilled on the baltic project area during during  we participated in drilling two exploratory dry holes  the czernic and the poniatowa  on the lublin project area in poland 
both wells were carried exploratory wells under the apache exploration program 
as such  apache covered all of our pro rata share of costs for both wells 
all of the exploratory dry hole costs recorded during were associated with wells drilled prior to nonproducing leasehold impairments were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no nonproducing leasehold impairments during the year ended december  during  we incurred a nonproducing leasehold impairment  relating to the williston basin in north dakota  where we no longer have exploration plans 
during  we incurred a nonproducing leasehold impairment of  relating to the lachowice farm in  which was noncommercial after recompleting a shut in well and testing another shut in well yielded noncommercial results  and  pertaining to a prospect in nevada where we no longer have exploration plans 
nonproducing leasehold impairments will vary from period to period based on our determination that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not realizable 
apache poland g a costs 
apache poland g a costs consist of our share of direct overhead costs incurred by apache in poland in accordance with the terms of the apache exploration program 
apache poland g a costs were  for the year ended december  there were no apache poland g a costs during the years ended december   and prior to july   apache covered all of our pro rata share of apache poland g a costs 
effective july   we began paying approximately of apache poland g a costs  to be adjusted as each of apache s remaining drilling requirements are completed  up to a maximum of 
in addition to the  of apache poland g a we paid during  apache covered approximately  of apache poland g a costs incurred by us during the second half of under an amendment to the apache exploration program effective january   referred to as the poland agreement  whereby apache agreed to issue us a credit of  against any outstanding invoices as of december   as well as any future costs billed by apache in return for the release of its commitment to cover our share of costs to shoot kilometers of d seismic data in the carpathian project area 
the annual budgeted amount of apache poland g a costs is subject to advance joint approval 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  oilfield services revenues were  higher than the same period of  primarily due to improved market conditions as a result of higher oil prices 
during all of and  we focused our oilfield servicing equipment on third party contract oilfield services in an effort to increase our domestic revenues rather than utilizing it on our company owned properties 
during  our oilfield services revenues consisted of  from third party contract oilfield services work conducted in the third and fourth quarters as we began to shift the primary focus of utilizing our oilfield servicing equipment to third party contract work rather than work performed on company owned properties 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate year to year based on market demand  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on utilizing our oilfield servicing equipment on our company owned properties and other factors 
oilfield servicing costs 
oilfield servicing costs were million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
during  oilfield servicing costs were a higher percentage of oilfield services revenues  as compared to and  due to higher than normal maintenance and repair costs associated with our oilfield servicing equipment 
during  oilfield servicing costs as a percentage of oilfield services revenues  were relatively flat as compared to the same period of in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield servicing costs will continue to fluctuate year to year based on revenues generated  market demand  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on utilizing our oilfield servicing equipment on our company owned properties and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
dd a expense was  lower during  as compared to  due to prior year capital additions becoming fully depreciated during dd a expense was  higher during  as compared to  due to prior year capital additions being depreciated for an entire year 
nonsegmented items dd a expense corporate 
dd a expense for corporate activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  during  and  respectively  on software  hardware and office equipment utilized primarily for corporate purposes 
dd a expense for corporate activities was progressively lower year to year  primarily due to assets purchased in prior years becoming fully depreciated coupled with a lesser amount of asset additions in the ensuing years 
g a costs 
g a costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  g a costs were  lower  as compared to the same period of  primarily due to lower payroll and associated costs 
during  g a costs were  higher  as compared to the same period of  primarily due to higher payroll and other related costs associated with our increasing emphasis on expanding our activities in poland 
subject to available funding  g a costs are expected to be at current or higher levels in future periods as we expand our presence in poland 
amortization of deferred compensation 
amortization of deferred compensation was  for the year ended december  there was no amortization of deferred compensation during the years ended december  and on august   we extended the term of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period 
in accordance with fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  we incurred deferred compensation cost of million  including million covering the intrinsic value applicable to officers and employees and  covering the fair market value calculated using the black scholes model for a consultant  to be amortized to expense over the one year vesting period 
interest and other income 
interest and other income were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable debt securities balances were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the average cash and marketable securities balances during   and were relatively constant from year to year 
we earned interest income of   and  during  and  respectively 
accrued interest income associated with officers notes receivable was   and  during  and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and we had no interest expense for the year ended december  during  we incurred  of interest expense relating to financing the purchase of five pickups used in our montana operations with one year notes 
during  we incurred  of interest expense primarily relating to the settlement of an audit by the blackfeet tribe pertaining to the cut bank field 
during the three years ended december   and  we had no long term debt 
officer loan impairment 
officer loan impairment was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no officer loan impairment for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the notes receivable from officers carrying value was  as of december   including principal and interest of million reduced by an impairment allowance of million based on the market value of  shares of the our common stock held as collateral 
on december   the officers surrendered the collateral shares to us in return for the cancellation of the notes receivable from officers and we recorded the resulting acquisition of  shares of treasury stock at a cost of  income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
net loss 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss in was due principally to million of exploration costs  an officer loan impairment of  and million of g a costs 
the net loss in was due principally to million of exploration costs  an officer loan impairment of  and million of g a costs 
the net loss in was due principally to million of exploration costs  a domestic proved property impairment of million and million of g a costs 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have relied primarily on proceeds from the sale of our common stock to fund our operating and investing activities 
during march  we signed a million loan agreement with rrpv to partially fund our planned ongoing activities in poland during during and  we received net proceeds of million and million  respectively  from the sale of our common stock in private transactions 
we also benefit from funds provided by our industry partners  primarily apache 
working capital 
we had working capital of  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
working capital as of december   was million lower  as compared to the end of  primarily due to a net loss of million during  which was partially offset by net proceeds of million from a private placement of  shares of our common stock 
working capital as of december   was million higher  as compared to the end of  primarily due to net proceeds of million from the private placement of  shares of our common stock  which was partially offset by a million net loss during operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million and million in our operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses incurred in those years 
during  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on operating activities exclusive of changes in working capital items 
net changes in working capital items increased cash used in operating activities by   and  during  and  respectively 
investing activities 
we used net cash of million and million in investing activities during and  respectively 
during  we received net cash from investing activities of million 
during  we spent million on exploratory dry holes  million on additions to proved properties  million on additions to unproved properties   on additions to oilfield servicing equipment   on corporate assets  million on purchasing marketable debt securities and received million from maturing or sold marketable debt securities 
during  we spent million on exploratory dry holes   on additions to properties  equipment and other assets  received  from the sale of property interests  spent million on purchasing marketable debt securities and received million from maturing or sold marketable debt securities 
during  we spent  on exploratory dry holes   on additions to properties  equipment and other assets  received  of proceeds from the sale of property interests and equipment  spent million on purchasing marketable debt securities and received million from maturing or sold marketable debt securities 
financing activities 
we received net cash of million and million from our financing activities during and  respectively 
during  we used net cash of  in our financing activities 
during  we received net proceeds of million million gross from the private placement of  shares of our common stock and received  in cash and  in the form of a full recourse promissory note secured by  shares of our common stock from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
also  during  we acquired  shares of treasury stock at a cost of  in a noncash transaction 
during  we advanced  to two officers  received net proceeds of million million gross from a private placement of  shares of common stock and  from the exercise of options on  shares of common stock 
during  we advanced  to officers and received  in cash and a full recourse note receivable of  from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in the past  our strategic partners have provided a substantial amount of the capital required under our exploration agreements with them 
we anticipate they may continue to do so in the future 
for instance  in  apache committed to cover our share of an exploration program in poland originally estimated to cost million gross approximately million net 
based on the original estimate  apache had spent approximately of million of those gross costs through december  as of december   apache had a remaining commitment to cover our share of approximately million of net costs in poland  comprised primarily of the following items o our share of costs to drill three exploratory wells two of which were drilling as of december   o the first  of costs other than carried costs incurred after december   o our share of costs to flow test and  if warranted  complete the wilga for production  and o to be reduced by as each of the three remaining exploratory wells are drilled of apache s g a in poland  computed on a monthly basis 
other industry partners have previously covered approximately million of our share of costs in other projects during the last five years 
capital requirements general 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities with no long term debt 
we believe this amount  along with the proceeds of a million loan agreement we signed during march with rrpv  the remaining apache carried costs and positive cash flow generated from our e p and oilfield services segments  will be sufficient to cover our minimum exploration and operating commitments during we have initiated discussions with commercial lenders and other gas purchasers for possible project funding related to our recent discoveries in poland as well as possible other future discoveries 
in order to fully fund or accelerate our current planned exploration and development activities  we will need additional capital 
the timing  pace  scope and amount of our capital expenditures are largely dependent on the availability of capital 
rrpv financing 
in march  we signed a million convertible note with rrpv 
the proceeds are to be used for exploration and development of additional gas reserves in poland 
in consideration for the loan  we granted rrpv an option to purchase up to mmcf per day of gas we produce in poland 
if rrpv elects to buy gas we produce in poland  the loan will be repayable over eight years 
if rrpv elects not to buy our gas  the loan will be repayable in march unless converted to restricted common stock at per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
as security for the loan  we have granted rrpv a lien on a portion of our gas reserves in poland 
fences project area 
we have agreed to spend million of exploration costs on the fences project area to earn a interest 
to date  we have paid approximately million of this commitment  including million to drill the kleka  million of drilling costs relating to the mieszkow and million to commence two separate d seismic data surveys 
after we complete our million commitment  pogc will begin bearing its share of further costs 
during  we expect to spend approximately million to finish processing the zaniemysl and donatowo d seismic grids  million on mieskow and approximately million each on one or more additional exploratory wells  as warranted and as funding permits 
apache exploration program 
during most of  we expect that a substantial portion of our share of costs relating to the apache exploration program will be covered by apache 
we have elected to utilize our tenth and final well carry on the chojnice  an exploratory well on the pomeranian project area  where we have a working interest 
in addition  apache must cover the first  of costs we incur during other than carried costs relating to our joint activities with apache in poland and the portion of apache poland g a that is attributable to the uncompleted portion of apache s ten exploratory well work commitment 
during  on the pomeranian project area  we plan to participate in an approximately million gross d seismic program covering approximately kilometers to confirm main dolomite reef leads on regional d seismic data and drill one or more exploratory wells including the chojnice  costing approximately million gross each to drill and complete  as warranted and as funding permits 
during the first half of  on the lublin project area  apache will cover our share of costs for an extended flow test on the wilga well and  if warranted  completion of the well for production 
the wilga extended flow test will assess the potential for commercial production in light of pipeline and facility expenditures that would be required 
on the warsaw west project area  we and apache are currently evaluating whether to acquire an additional kilometers of d seismic data by november  in order to fulfill the remaining work commitment required for the first three year exploration period on the warsaw west project area usufruct 
on the carpathian project area  we and apache are currently evaluating whether to acquire an additional kilometers of d seismic data and commence drilling an exploratory well by the end of  in order to fulfill the remaining work commitments required for the first three year exploration period on the usufruct 
other 
if we have the opportunity to participate in additional appraisal  development or exploration projects with pogc  we may be required to obtain additional capital 
we expect to incur minimal exploration expenditures on our baltic project area in poland during similarly  we expect to incur minimal exploration  appraisal and development expenditures on our domestic operations during we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events that we cannot predict 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
we may obtain funds for future capital investments from the sale of additional securities  project financing  sale of partial property interests  strategic alliances with other energy or financial partners or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk market risk our major market risk exposure continues to be the price we receive for our production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil applicable to the united states  and the domestic price of gas in poland  subject to gravity  energy content and other adjustments for the actual oil and gas sold 
historically  oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our domestic oil production and polish gas production is expected to continue into the future 
see items and business and properties risk factors 
we do not engage in any hedging activities to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do so if we achieve a significant amount of production in poland 
we currently do not have any derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland  primarily in us dollars or the us dollar equivalent of the polish zloty 
we conduct our day to day business on this basis as well 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
the exchange rates for the polish zloty were  and per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
we do not currently engage in hedging transactions to protect ourselves against foreign currency risks  nor do we intend to do so in the foreseeable future
