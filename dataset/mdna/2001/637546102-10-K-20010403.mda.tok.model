item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
results of operations consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net income for the national security group the company was million in compared to million in on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in operating results in the company s property casualty subsidiaries were much improved due to the elimination of several general agent auto programs  but a non recurring charge incurred due to a management decision to strengthen reserves in certain blocks of industrial life policies decreased earnings by approximately 
per share 
realized capital gains in were million compared to million in consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in the operating results of the subsidiaries are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net income for the national security group the company was million in compared to  in on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in the increase in net income was due to improved operating results in the company s property casualty subsidiaries operations 
realized capital gains in were million compared to million in consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life and accident and health insurance  property and casualty insurance  and other is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life and accident and health insurance    property and casualty insurance    income before taxes and cumulative effect adjustment life and accident and health insurance    property and casualty insurance    other interest expense life and accident and health insurance operations the company s life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  income before income taxes in was  compared to  in a one time charge for reserve increases on certain blocks of old industrial life insurance  which nsic no longer sells  was the primary factor contributing to the decrease in income before income taxes 
nsic increased premium income to  in compared to  in life insurance premium income increased in  and accident and health insurance decreased slightly compared to life insurance sales through independent agents was the source of premium growth in nsic in as experienced in  life insurance commission expense increased again in life insurance issued by nsic pays a higher commission in early years of the policy and the commission rate decreases in succeeding years 
since nsic has experienced a large increase in new business volume  commission expense has increased 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  income before income taxes in was  compared to  in operating results for were very similar to  with slightly higher realized capital gains producing the modest increase in income before income tax 
nsic experienced a increase in premium income primarily due to increased sales of life insurance through independent agents 
the company began offering life and accident insurance products through independent agents in prior to nsic used employee agents as its only method of distribution of life and accident insurance products 
the increase in premium revenues also produced an increase in commission expense 
first year commissions are paid at a higher rate than commissions paid in succeeding years 
the increase in premium revenues was produced entirely by sales of new insurance policies  and consequently increased commission expense 
as these policies renew in succeeding years  commissions on these policies will decrease 
property casualty operations the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income before income tax was  in compared to  in improved underwriting results for the second straight year was the primary factor contributing to the improvement in income before tax 
the elimination of several unprofitable private passenger and commercial auto insurance programs run by managing general agents was the primary factor leading to the improvement in underwriting results 
management terminated the contract of the last remaining auto general agent program in the program  which produced private passenger auto premium in florida  was terminated due to continued poor underwriting results 
the final policies in force on this program will expire by mid with the elimination of this program and other similar programs over the last two years management has significantly improved underwriting results 
the elimination of the general agent programs combined with slight decreases in other core lines of business led to a decrease in earned premium in compared to however  in the last half of nsfc did begin to experience a slight turnaround in premium production in core lines of business  which management attributes to an increase focus on marketing to independent insurance agents 
also  the elimination of the unprofitable managing general agent programs greatly improved underwriting profitability 
in an effort to increase premium production in internally managed auto programs  as opposed the managing general agent form of distribution  omega acquired of the outstanding stock of liberty southern insurance company for a total cash purchase price of approximately  the purchase was consummated in the second quarter of with the purchase of liberty southern  omega gained entry into the monthly bill private passenger auto market 
the program is expected to produce  in direct written premium in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income before income tax was  in compared to a pretax loss of  in an improvement in underwriting results and reduced litigation expenses were the major factors contributing to the improvement in pretax income 
nsfc had much improved underwriting results in the dwelling property lines of insurance compared to in nsfc incurred over  in tornado losses  while in tornado losses were minimal 
nsfc also did not incur any significant hurricane losses in in nsfc incurred over  in hurricane losses 
the decrease in hurricane and tornado losses of over million led to much improved underwriting results in compared to the automobile insurance programs had underwriting losses of over  in several of these programs which were managed by independent managing general agents have been discontinued over the last year and management believes that future losses from the discontinued programs will be greatly reduced compared to losses incurred in and one program managed by a managing general agent was still in operation in florida in  but management terminated the agents contract in company management expects to maintain a presence in the automobile insurance market  but future growth and expansion will be through the traditional independent agents with claims and underwriting functions managed and closely monitored by in house personnel 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the statutory combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums earned 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums written during the year 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
the combined ratio for compared to decreased over ten percentage points 
this improvement is primarily attributable to the elimination of the previously mentioned managing general agent auto programs over the last two years  and no significant tornado or hurricane activity during the year 
the combined ratio for improved substantially compared to catastrophe losses and very unfavorable underwriting results in private passenger and commercial automobile lines of business contributed to the higher combined ratio in asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to national association of insurance commissioners naic securities valuation office svo rating standards  and the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of moody s and standard and poor s svo equivalents of total svo class moody s standard and poor s bond portfolio aaa to a aaa to a baa to baa bbb to bbb ba to ba bb to bb b to b b to b caa to ca ccc to c c ci to d as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement and reclassified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held to maturity 
with that reclassification  the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million and million at december  and respectively 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
market risk disclosures since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately million 
certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note a presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities  and is incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of loss of principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on net worth for a sustained period of time  and low price to book value or low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investment  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicate that operating activities used provided cash of    in   and respectively 
those statements also classify the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities  and financing activities and disclose the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet the company s obligations 
the company has standby letters of credit of less than  these letters are used to guarantee obligations of the property casualty subsidiary under assumed reinsurance contracts 
the letters of credit are secured by certain invested assets of the company 
the company also routinely incurs liability for declared but unpaid dividends 
long term liquidity needs of the company constitute only those items which are directly related to the principal business operations of the company 
the company has notes payable of million at december  the notes payable are to be repaid in quarterly installments over five years 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note o to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note k to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to million in the life insurance subsidiary and million in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula will be used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of eight to one at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements
