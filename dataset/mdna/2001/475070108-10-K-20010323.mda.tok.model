sales are one of the statistics we use to track performance 
because of the nature of our sales  which are primarily long duration contracts in the individual products and aip segments  sales in a given quarter do not have a near term material impact on operating results and therefore are not considered to be material information 
however  trends relating to new product sales over a longer period of time may be an indicator of future growth and profitability 
reportable segments are determined in a manner consistent with the way management organizes for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance 
invested assets backing insurance liabilities are assigned to segments in relation to policyholder funds and reserves 
net deferred acquisition costs incurred  value of business acquired  reinsurance receivables and communications assets are assigned to the respective segments where those assets originate 
invested assets are also assigned to back capital allocated to each segment in relation to jp s philosophy for managing business risks  reflecting appropriate conservatism

the company has a formal investment policy that governs overall quality and diversification

jp s investment policy statement requires an average quality fixed income portfolio excluding mortgage loans of a or higher 
currently  the average quality is a 
the policy also imposes limits on the amount of lower quality investments and requires diversification by issuer and asset type 
the company monitors higher risk investments for compliance with the policy and for proper valuation

the majority of mortgage backed security holdings are sequential and planned amortization class tranches of federal agency issuers 
the mortgage backed security portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to lower cash flow volatility over a range of interest rate levels 
effective january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  and the discussion in the new accounting pronouncements section of note is incorporated by reference 
market risk exposures since jp s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
during  year us treasury rates decreased basis points versus an increase of basis points in in  risk premiums over rates that could otherwise be earned on us treasury securities increased due to continued poor liquidity conditions and expectations of deteriorating credit conditions in the market 
in  risk premiums over rates that could otherwise be earned on us treasury securities remained favorable for investors compared to in response to heavy corporate debt issuance 
in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases  causing funds to be reinvested at lower yields 
the company limits this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio on non callable securities  by carefully selecting cmo s that are structured to minimize cash flow volatility and by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for the company s products  as bank certificates of deposit with no surrender charges  and higher average returns from equity markets  may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for the company to sustain spreads between rates credited on interest sensitive products and portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
the company manages this risk by adjusting interest crediting rates  at least on an annual basis  with due regard to the yield of its investment portfolio and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
as is typical in the industry  the company s life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest credited 
for interest sensitive life products  the minimum rates range from approximately to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  the minimum rates range from to  with the greatest concentration in the to range 
the company employs various methodologies to manage its exposure to interest rate risks 
the asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of the company s insurance operations 
jp monitors the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  giving measurement to the optionality of cash flows 
the company s goal in such analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product category  and for the company as a whole 
at december  and  and of policy liabilities related to interest sensitive portfolios 
the company also considers the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps  and debt and exchangeable securities 
the following table shows the estimated impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would be expected to have on the company s earnings for a calendar year  based on the assumptions contained in the company s model 
management believes that its analysis of the effects of basis point increases and decreases utilized in the sensitivity analysis below reflects reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates as of december  and the change in these estimates was due primarily to differences in the yield curves and in the sensitivities they introduced to the company s model 
incremental income loss change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points these estimates were derived by modeling estimated cash flows of the company s market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
changes in interest rates illustrated above assume parallel shifts in the yield curve graded pro rata over four quarters 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of jp s current investment strategy  and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when issuers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates within insurance portfolios give consideration to relationships expected between crediting rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact on amortization of dac and voba 
the model is based on the company s existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact as discussed above of interest rate fluctuations on sales 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities other than trading 
jp holds common stock with a fair value of approximately of such value is represented by investments in a single issuer  bank of america corporation bankamerica 
the company s exchangeable securities are exchangeable into shares of bankamerica common stock
