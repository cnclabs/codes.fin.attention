overview adam 
com develops and syndicates web enabled medical and health information products 
these products combine physician reviewed text  medical illustrations  animation  d models  and interactive tools 
our experience in developing products for the educational market  from k through higher education  enable us to create products that explain complex medical and health subject matter in a way that is easily understood and retained by the end user 
since  we have been marketing our online health information products to a variety of customers in the ehealth and elearning markets 
these customers range from large consumer portal sites such as yahoo  to large government sponsored sites such as the national library of medicine 
our business model is based upon multi year licensing agreements that yield recurring revenues and high gross margins 
our content assets  more than years in the making  include more than  pages of text based information that are regularly updated for editorial excellence   medical illustrations that have been drawn and compiled by our in house team of master degreed medical illustrators  an extensive library of d models derived from the visible human project  thousands of animations depicting disease states and other medical conditions and topics  many of which are broadcast quality  and interactive tools and technology 
collectively  we believe these assets represent the single largest database of proprietary health and medical related content anywhere in the world 
we believe that pictures are worth a thousand words and illustrated approaches to explaining medical conditions can have a significant impact on the way people understand their bodies and medical situations that affect it 
we also believe that our products will have an impact in the way patient education information is delivered and used in personal health management  prevention  care management  and after care applications 
over time  we believe we have the potential to capture a significant share of the patient education market with our premium visual and text based health information  whether it is being distributed over the internet or a component of point of care applications within the health provider system 
given the explosive growth of internet usage  and more than million adult americans who have searched for health or medical information online  we believe that our products will also play an increasing role in the service offerings of healthcare providers  the pharmaceutical industry  and the health insurance and managed care industries 
these organizations are actively looking for ways to improve efficiencies  communicate better with current and potential patients and plan members  and remain competitive in an environment that is increasingly becoming more crowded with direct to consumer marketing 
these organizations must also deal with broader technical and compliancy issues such as hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act and other federal regulations as they begin to effect changes in the us healthcare system 
we will also focus our marketing efforts on the growing us hispanic population 
with more than million spanish speaking consumers in the us  we believe that there will be an increasing need to provide health information to this fast growing community 
new legislation requiring federally funded organizations  such as hospitals and other healthcare providers  to translate information into other languages for people with limited english proficiency  will fuel our opportunities with spanish versions of our health information products 
with these changes  we believe that traditional healthcare organizations will not only be more technically adept  but also will increasingly embrace and appreciate the content rich  unique nature of our health information products  tools and technology 
we currently provide our web based products to more than syndication customers that include some of the largest portal sites on the internet  as well as a major pharmaceutical organization  healthcare providers and specialty health web sites 
through this syndication network  our content is searched and viewed by millions of consumers around the world 
based upon the size and scope of our syndication network  we believe that adam 
com is the single largest provider of disease related information on the internet  and one of the most well recognized health information brands

internet revenues consist primarily of platform term license fees where customers license the right to use the company s proprietary web based content and applications over the term of the license  and page view advertising fees 
platform license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement commencing upon customer acceptance and page view advertising fees are recognized as earned based on page views

revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and there are no significant return or acceptance provisions 
allowances for estimated product returns are provided at the time of sale 
the company evaluates the adequacy of allowances for returns primarily based upon its evaluation of historical and expected sales experience and by channel of distribution 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is evaluated on an ongoing basis and is based generally upon the age of outstanding receivables and other factors we deem relevant 
as certain conditions change  such as sell through experience  channels of distribution  and general economic conditions  the estimated reserves required for returns and allowances may also change

com common stock 
the agreement also gave us the right to require fusion to purchase a second  debenture  at our sole discretion 
fusion converted approximately  of this debenture into shares of our common stock and  on july  the debenture matured at which time the remaining unconverted balance of restricted cash was repaid to the issuer 
we elected not to require fusion to purchase the second  debenture 
on september   adam 
com entered into a common stock purchase agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc  an affiliate of fusion capital fund i  llc 
pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement  fusion capital agreed to purchase up to  of the company s common stock in two rounds of  each 
the purchase price of the common stock is based upon the future market price of the common stock 
the company determines the month of purchase based on its cash requirements 
at the time of the sale  adam 
com estimated that the maximum number of shares the company would issue under the first round to be  should the company be required to issue or more of its outstanding shares  then shareholder approval will be required prior to further sales to fusion 
the company has the right to terminate the agreement at any time if more than  shares are issuable under the first round of the common stock purchase agreement 
in conjunction with this transaction  the company issued to fusion  shares of common stock having a fair value equal to approximately  as a fee for the agreement 
shares with a fair value of  are required to be issued to fusion if the company elects to enter into a second round 
as of december   the company has sold  shares of common stock and received cash totaling approximately  as a result of this common stock purchase agreement 
subsequent to calendar  the company has sold an additional  shares of common stock worth to fusion and received cash totaling approximately  on december   the company issued notes payable in exchange for  each from our chief executive officer and a commercial bank 
these notes accrued interest at per annum with principal and interest due initially on december  the terms of these notes allowed for an extension of six months  to june  at the option of the holders 
the company issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to the lenders in conjunction with the issuance of the notes and the related extensions pursuant to the original terms of the notes 
the warrants are exercisable at any time at the option of the holders through december  and entitle the holders to purchase an equal number of common shares at a weighted average price of per share 
the company paid the note and interest earned in full to the commercial bank on june   and by december  had paid approximately  of the principal and the interest earned through november  to our chief executive officer with a  balance outstanding at december  for calendar  the company s net loss continues to be significant due to expenditures related to the execution of our overall business strategy  which is consistent with growth in operations  staffing and infrastructure development 
while high for the year  these expenditures  excluding restructuring and certain non recurring  non cash charges  have steadily decreased on a sequential quarterly basis during calendar and have stabilized as of december  due to lowered costs resulting from our restructuring which began in the fourth quarter of  our sequential  quarterly operating losses during calendar decreased from   and  in the first three quarters  to operating income of  for the fourth quarter of management anticipates that overall expenses will stabilize at their current levels for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate continued current levels of investment for content development  improved and new technologies  infrastructure development and product marketing and sales efforts 
however  we will also continue to evaluate opportunities that create efficiencies  consolidate operating costs and reduce overhead such that overall expenditure levels remain controlled 
on march  we received notification from the nasdaq stock market  listing qualifications division that our net tangible assets as of december  did not meet the minimum  net tangible assets requirement for the nasdaq national market under marketplace rule a 
as a result  their staff is reviewing our company s eligibility for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  and has given us the opportunity to present a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with listing requirements 
we have submitted such plan and believe that the components of our plan reasonably assure that adam 
com will become compliant within three to six months of the march  plan submission date 
while there can be no assurance that the nasdaq staff will accept our plan or that they will not issue written notification that our securities will be delisted in which case we would appeal such decision  we believe that there are measures currently available to us that could be immediately implemented to become compliant sooner 
certain measures involve the issuance of additional shares to fusion pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement or to other interested investors  which could result in dilution to our existing shareholders 
management believes that cash on hand  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  together with the proceeds already realized from and access to additional proceeds from the common stock purchase agreement described above  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs through december  however  we may be required to raise additional funds in order to accelerate development of new and existing services and products  to respond to competitive pressures or to possibly acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that any required additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest and these securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
if additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt securities  we may be subject to certain limitations on our operations  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
this bulletin summarizes certain of the staff s views in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the required implementation of sab was deferred until the fourth quarter of  although we adopted it as of january  the implementation of the provisions of sab did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of adam 
com 
in september  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs  which requires amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling to be classified as revenue 
in addition  the issue established that the classification of shipping and handling costs is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to apb opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies 
if shipping and handling costs are significant and are not included in cost of sales  a company should disclose both the amount of such costs and which line item on the income statement includes that amount 
this issue is applicable no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  the company s current accounting policies conform to this new guidance 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
this opinion provides guidance on the accounting for certain stock option transactions and subsequent amendments to stock option transactions 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on adam 
com s financial position or results of operations for calendar this interpretation requires variable accounting treatment for options that have been modified from their original terms 
accordingly  compensation cost shall be adjusted for increases or decreases in the intrinsic value of the modified awards in subsequent periods and until the awards have been exercised  forfeited  or expired 
as of december   the company had  outstanding options with an exercise price of that are considered variable under this interpretation 
because the stock price since the effective date of july  has been below  the company recorded no compensation cost in calendar subsequent to calendar an officer and director of the company relinquished  of these shares 
as a result the company currently has  outstanding options with an exercise price of that are considered variable under this interpretation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  invested in liquid money market funds or bank accounts and investment securities of  the cash and cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk and we may receive higher or lower interest income if market interest rates increase or decrease 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by percent from levels at december  would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows
