item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran designs  develops  manufactures  markets and services a broad range of high speed digital transmission products utilized by providers of telecommunications services serviced by adtran s carrier networks division or cn and corporate end users serviced by adtran s enterprise networks division or en to implement advanced digital data services over existing telephone networks 
we currently sell our products to a large number of carriers  including all rbocs  and to private and public enterprises worldwide 
adtran s sales have increased each year due primarily to increases in the number of units sold to both new and existing customers 
these annual sales increases reflect our strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared both to the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of adtran s strategy is to engineer the reduction of the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a low cost  high quality provider of products in our markets 
adtran s success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent re design  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables adtran to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
while adtran has experienced increased sales in each year  our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we operate with very little order backlog 
a substantial majority of our sales in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
furthermore  a majority of customers typically require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for adtran s products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results will be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could impact adtran s financial results significantly in a given quarter 
further  maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory which may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of such inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
adtran s operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  product warranty returns and announcements of new products by adtran or our competitors 
accordingly  adtran s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that adtran s financial results may vary from period to period

fifty million dollars of adtran s phase iii expansion was approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the alabama state industrial development authority the authority 
that incentive program enables participating companies to generate alabama corporate income tax credits that can be used to reduce the amount of alabama corporate income taxes that would otherwise be payable 
there can be no assurance that the state of alabama will continue to make these corporate income tax credits available in the future  and we therefore may not realize the full benefit of these incentives 
through december   the authority had issued  of its taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the incentive program and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bond to us 
we are required to make payments to the authority in amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the authority s taxable revenue bond  series  as amended  currently outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of  the bond matures on january   and bears interest at the rate of basis points over the money market rate of first union national bank of tennessee 
adtran s working capital position improved from  as of december  to  as of december  due to cash generated from operations and the sale of certain marketable equity securities  as discussed below 
adtran has used  and expects to continue to use  the cash generated from operations for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and the expansion of sales and marketing activities 
inventory increased from december  to december  the increase is attributable to two factors our expectations of increased shipments to existing customers and increasing quantities of certain commodities in anticipation of marketwide allocations 
accounts receivables increased from december  to december  the increase is a result of our continued sales growth and extended payment terms for some of our major customers 
other receivables have increased due to the sale of raw materials to our subcontractors

we believe these available sources of funds to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for the foreseeable future
