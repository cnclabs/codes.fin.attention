the offering represented approximately of waddell reed s shares 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after underwriters fees and expenses 
waddell reed used million of the proceeds to repay existing notes owed to torchmark and other torchmark subsidiaries and retained the remaining million 
torchmark s million proceeds from the note repayments were invested or used to pay down debt

summary of operating results 
torchmark s management computes a classification of income called net operating income 
torchmark s management focuses on net operating income in evaluating the operating performance of the company 
it differs from net income as reported in the financial statements in that it excludes unusual and nonrecurring income or loss items and nonoperating items which distort operating trends 
it also excludes discontinued operations 
the following items were excluded from net income as reported in torchmark s financial statements in order to compute net operating income realized investment gains and losses and the related adjustment to deferred acquisition costs  net of tax  net income or loss from the discontinued operations of waddell reed  including the million nonrecurring expenses of the spin off  torchmark s pro rata share of the income or losses related to vesta in the nonrecurring loss from the redemption by torchmark of its debt in in the amount of million net of tax and the gain from redemption of debt in of 
million net of tax  a one time gain on the sale of equipment included in other income in the after tax amount of million in  and the effect of a change in accounting principle which modified the accounting for an interest rate swap instrument  increasing net income in the after tax amount of million in additionally  in  torchmark entered into a life insurance marketing arrangement with a third party  discussed more fully under the caption life insurance on page of this report 
this agreement contained certain cash guarantees to the third party which would not be recoverable by torchmark based on test marketing results 
accordingly  torchmark recorded a nonrecurring after tax operating charge of million  or 
per diluted share in because this was an unusual one time charge  net operating income has been presented before the charge for comparability

a detailed discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance

the direct response operation is characterized by lower acquisition costs than torchmark s agency based marketing systems

direct response life premium was million in  increasing over premium of million 
direct response life premium in grew over premium of million 
annualized premium sold by the direct response operation was million in  increasing over sales of million  due in part to a higher average premium per policy issued 
sales in rose over sales of million 
sales growth in had declined from due in part to the withdrawal from the under age adult direct mail market because of unfavorable financial results from that market 
direct mail sales to ages to were interrupted for part of the year while those products were repriced to improve their financial results 
the annualized life premium issued by the direct response group represented of torchmark s total life sales in direct response annualized life premium in force rose to million at december  from million a year earlier 
at december   direct response life annualized premium in force was of torchmark s total  second only to that of the liberty national exclusive agency 
direct response life insurance annualized premium in force grew in in addition to growth in life insurance sales and premium  the direct response operation has promoted growth in some of torchmark s agent based distribution channels through marketing support 
this support includes providing sales leads and assisting in agent recruiting 
this assistance has contributed indirectly to the growth in premium in other torchmark distribution agencies 
for example  direct response marketing support indirectly contributed to the increase in health sales by the united american exclusive agency through its assistance in the agent recruiting process and by providing leads to the agents 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system represented torchmark s largest contribution to life insurance premium income in each of the three years presented  with premium of million representing of torchmark s total life premium 
the annualized life premium in force of the liberty agency was million at year end  compared with million and million at year ends and  respectively 
life premium sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  grew during to million  compared with growth in sales growth in the liberty agency is largely attributable to growth in the number of agents 
liberty s agent count increased from  agents at year end to  agents at year end  an increase of 
they further increased to  at year end and to  at year end ongoing agent recruitment efforts and training programs  which help to improve agent retention  have been responsible for the growth in this agency 
management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
the american income exclusive agency is a distribution system that focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
at december   premium from this system accounted for of torchmark s total life premium 
in  american income s premium rose to million  after a increase in to million 
annualized life premium in force was million at year end  an increase of over premium in force of million 
annualized life premium in force rose in sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  compared with million in both and these sales represented a increase in  compared with a increase in and a decrease in the turnaround in sales for this agency was a result of the growth in the number of agents 
an decline in agent count was experienced in to  agents at december   and a further decline in the first half of resulted in  agents at june  however  changes in american income s marketing organization were implemented in to reverse the decline in the number of agents 
as a result  the american income agency had  agents at year end and  agents at year end  representing a increase in the second half of and a increase in agency size in american income s marketing organization continues to implement efforts to improve agent recruiting  retention  and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency 
the united american independent and exclusive agencies together represented about of torchmark s total life premium in on a combined basis  life premium rose to million in after a increase in from million to million 
annualized life premium issued in was million  increasing over issues of million 
the united american independent agency represented torchmark s largest growth on a percentage basis of any component agency in life premium income and life sales in life premium income rose to million and life sales gained to million 
torchmark s other life insurance distribution system consists of its military agency  united investors agency  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
torchmark s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies  including the sales representatives of waddell reed 
life premium income from the other distribution category grew to million in and to million in life premium income from the other group accounted for of torchmark s total life insurance premium income 
annualized life premium in force grew in to million  after having increased to million in a major factor in the growth of premium income and in force premium relates to the high persistency associated with the military business 
annualized premium sold during in the other distribution category was million  flat with both and sales which were also million in each year 
in addition to the growth in life insurance sales  this agency has also increased production of variable life collections 
in  collections were million  representing a increase over collections of million 
in  these collections rose 
although variable life collections are not included in premium in force data  they are indicative of growth in the variable life account balance 
indirectly  they add to premium revenue through the policy account charges for insurance coverage and administration as the account balance grows 
at december   the variable life account balance was million  rising over the prior year end

these products were marketed through torchmark s direct response operation  and required torchmark to guarantee specified compensation to reader s digest  regardless of marketing success 
test marketing began in the fourth quarter of the less than favorable results from these tests indicated that it would be unlikely that torchmark would recover the full amount of compensation guaranteed to reader s digest under the terms of the agreement 
as a result  torchmark recorded a nonrecurring operating charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge represented million after tax or 
per diluted share 
torchmark has maintained its relationship with reader s digest and has used its subscriber lists in selective marketing of torchmark insurance products and intends to continue to do so 
however  torchmark will only incur its normal solicitation costs on future business and will have no further costs related to the guaranteed compensation 
life insurance gross margins have been presented in the above table to remove the effect of family service underwriting income in and the nonrecurring charge  which distort comparisons 
excluding these items  gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense  increased in to million after having risen in to million 
as a percentage of life insurance premium  life insurance gross margins were in both and  but were in one factor in the decline in is the reduction in underwriting income margins for direct response 
as a percentage of premium  direct response underwriting income was in  compared with a year earlier 
additionally  an increase in policy obligation ratios was experienced in the other category in the first half of  which appears to have been a short term aberration 
fluctuations in obligation ratios are normal in the life insurance industry 
health insurance 
torchmark markets its supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution method during each of the three years ended december  health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agency    liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agency    direct response    premium for the health insurance segment increased to million in over and to million in annualized health premium in force grew to billion at december  over the previous year end balance of million 
health premium in force rose during sales of health insurance  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  increasing over sales of million 
sales in rose over the prior year 
sales for marked the third consecutive year of or more growth in health insurance sales 
sales of health insurance have accelerated greatly in these years due to increases in sales of medicare supplement policies 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies include medicare supplement  cancer  long term care  and other under age limited benefit supplemental medical and hospitalization products 
as a percentage of annualized health premium in force at december   medicare supplement accounted for and cancer 
the table below presents torchmark s health insurance annualized premium in force by major product category at december  and for the two preceding years 
health insurance annualized premium in force by product dollar amounts in thousands december  of of of amount total amount total amount total medicare supplement    cancer    other    total    medicare supplement insurance is sold primarily by the united american exclusive agency and the united american independent agency 
health sales in both agencies have grown significantly in the past three years 
the united american exclusive agency is torchmark s fastest growing agency in terms of health premium sales 
the exclusive agency sold million in annualized health premium in  a increase over the prior year 
health sales for this agency rose in to million after having increased in this agency accounted for million of the million in health premium growth in  or  adding primarily medicare supplement premium 
it also was instrumental in the growth of health annualized premium in force in both and  accounting for million of the million growth in and adding million to health premium in force in this agency represented of torchmark s annualized health premium in force at december   compared with one year earlier and two years ago 
the united american exclusive agency has grown very rapidly in recent years 
at december   there were  agents  compared with  agents at year end and  agents at year end this represents an increase in agency size of in and in the united american independent agency continues to represent the largest amount of torchmark s health premium in force and is also growing rapidly 
the agency s million of annualized health premium in force at december   of which million was medicare supplement premium in force  was of torchmark s total health premium in force 
health sales by the united american independent agency  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  a increase over sales rose to million in medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans  limits on first year agent compensation  and mandated minimum loss ratios 
however  they remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries 
about of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some of the deductibles and coinsurance for which the federal medicare program does not pay 
during the last few years  torchmark has focused on developing its united american exclusive agency to serve this market 
use of targeted marketing support and increased agent recruiting have led to increased sales 
because of loss ratio regulation  underwriting margins on medicare supplements are less than on torchmark s life business 
however  due to united american s low cost  service oriented customer service and claims administration  as well as its economies of scale  it is a profitable line of business 
until recently the primary competition for medicare supplement sales had come from medicare health maintenance organizations hmo s  the managed care alternative to traditional fee for service medicare which eliminated the need for a supplemental policy 
however  in the last few years  growing public dissatisfaction with managed care  increased medical cost inflation and increased federal government regulatory pressures on medicare hmo s have caused an increasing number of hmo s to withdraw from the market  reducing that competition 
other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market 
medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program cause the need for annual rate increases  which generally require state insurance department approval 
in addition  congress and the federal administration have begun studying ways to restructure the medicare program 
therefore  it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program at sometime in the future 
however  it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs 
as a result  medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for senior age consumers 
cancer insurance premium in force rose in to million  compared with growth in sales of this product declined in to million from million in sales in sales in were also million 
a portion of the growth in cancer annualized premium in force has been attributable to premium rate increases to offset increased health care costs 
cancer insurance products are sold primarily by the liberty national exclusive agency 
this agency represented of torchmark s total cancer annualized premium in force at december  annualized premium in force for other health products grew in to million  after rising in to million 
other health sales rose in to million  after having increased in health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium    policy obligations    required interest on reserves    net policy obligations    commissions and premium taxes    amortization of acquisition costs    required interest on deferred acquisition costs    total expense    insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expenses 
   health insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense rose in to million  after having increased in as a percentage of premium  underwriting income before other income and administrative expense remained steady at approximately throughout the three year period ending in medicare supplement margins are restrained by the federally mandated minimum loss ratio of and by competition 
cancer product obligation ratios have increased in recent years primarily due to higher loss ratios experienced on a closed block of business 
management has actively sought timely and adequate premium rate increases from regulatory authorities to offset these cost increases 
as a result  margins on cancer business improved slightly in torchmark continues to seek such rate increases to maintain margins on this business 
annuities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety of needs  including retirement income and long term  tax deferred growth opportunities 
torchmark s annuities are sold almost entirely by the united investors agency  a component of torchmark s other distribution category 
this agency consists of the waddell reed sales force which markets united investors annuities and other products under a marketing agreement 
in  this agency collected million of torchmark s total million in annuity collections  or 
the united investors agency accounted for almost of total annuity policy charges in annuities are also marketed by the united american independent agency  which collected million in annuity deposits in  compared with million in annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds  which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to fixed annuity policyholders 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities  excluding family service 
annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in dollar amounts in millions thousands fixed    variable       total       collections of fixed annuity premium were million in  compared with million in  a decrease 
fixed annuity premium collections rose in from million in management believes that the interest rate environment is one factor in the sales of fixed annuities 
as rates fall  alternative investments including variable annuities become more attractive 
in  as interest rates increased  fixed annuities became more desirable relative to alternative investments 
even though rates continued to rise in  a decline in fixed annuity sales resulted from the loss of a key independent agent from the united american independent agency 
this decline is expected to be temporary as management is in the process of redirecting annuity sales efforts in this agency 
the fixed annuity deposit balance declined in to million at year end 
it rose in the prior year from million at year end to million at the end of variable annuity collections rose to million in  from million in the prior year 
variable collections rose from million in the strength in financial markets throughout most of and the two preceding years has had a positive influence on sales of variable annuities in each period 
the variable annuity account balance continues to grow 
this balance increased in from billion at december  to billion at year end this balance had previously increased in and in strong financial markets in all of these periods contributed greatly to the growth  although some weakening in markets was experienced in the latter part of variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities 
the additional collections in each year also added to the balances

policy charges have also grown in each period  rising in and in growth in policy charges is primarily related to the growth in the size of the account balance  but is also attributable to the increase in the number of annuity contracts in force and the cumulative effect of the growth in sales over the past few years upon which the sales charge is based 
investments 
the following table summarizes torchmark s investment income and excess investment income 
analysis of excess investment income dollar amounts in thousands net investment income    tax equivalency adjustment    tax equivalent investment income    required interest on net insurance policy liabilities interest on reserves    interest on deferred acquisition costs    net required    financing costs    excess investment income    mean invested assets at amortized cost    average net insurance policy liabilities    average debt including mips    excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and cash flow management 
it is defined as net investment income on a tax equivalent basis reduced by the interest cost credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
excess investment income is increased in a number of ways an increase in investment yields over the rates credited to policyholders liabilities or in relationship to the rates applicable to torchmark debt  growth in invested assets in relation to policy liabilities and debt  and the efficient use of capital resources and cash flow 
net investment income increased to million in in  net investment income declined to million after rising to million in on a tax equivalent basis  in which the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities  investment income gained in  after declining in and rising in the increase in investment income resulted from a combination of the growth in mean invested assets and an increase in yield 
mean invested assets  computed based on book value  rose to billion in over the prior year  as new cash flow was invested primarily in taxable fixed maturities 
the mean fixed maturity balance rose million or to billion for the growth in mean invested assets was achieved even though million was used to buy torchmark stock and million was used to pay down long and short term debt 
higher interest rates in financial markets caused yields on the fixed maturity portfolio to rise basis points in to 
the decline in investment income was a result of the sale of family service in the second quarter of and repurchases of torchmark stock since late the family service sale resulted in the investment of approximately million proceeds  producing an additional million of investment income in  compared with incremental investment income of million in however  the tax equivalent net investment income also included million earned on family service assets which were not included in mean invested assets were flat in  as the growth in invested assets from reinvested cash flows was essentially offset by the loss of family service s million in invested assets when compared with the prior year 
excess investment income increased in both and because of the effect of repurchases of torchmark stock  excess investment income on a per share basis increased in both and the increase in correlated closely with the change in tax equivalent investment income for the same period 
while the sale of family service caused a reduction in investment income when compared with  it had little effect on the excess investment income comparison in with the reduction in required interest on family service s policy liabilities offset the loss in investment income 
the increase in excess investment income resulted primarily from decreased financing costs  due to debt paydowns 
during  torchmark entered into two transactions to dispose of the majority of its investment real estate 
total consideration for the combined transactions was million of which million was cash 
the real estate dispositions resulted in an after tax loss of million 
after the sales  torchmark retained million in investment real estate  of which million was represented by properties partially occupied by torchmark subsidiaries 
at december   torchmark held million in investment real estate 
portfolio adjustments resulting in million in after tax capital losses were taken in these losses were partially offset  however  by a million after tax gain from the increase in market value of the interest rate swap associated with torchmark s mips  discussed in more depth under the caption capital resources found on page of this discussion 
in  in addition to the real estate capital losses  torchmark also generated million in after tax losses during from the planned sale of fixed maturities 
these losses allowed torchmark to carry back and recover capital gains taxes paid in prior years 
realized losses in also included a million after tax loss from the interest rate swap on torchmark s mips 
while yields as measured by returns on us treasury securities fell substantially during  corporate spreads widened and afforded investors the opportunity to increase nominal and effective returns 
new investments in fixed maturity securities  which totaled billion in  billion in  and billion in  were made at an effective compounded yield of in  compared with an effective compounded yield of in and in these yields equate to nominal yields on acquisition of   and  respectively  for   and the size of acquisitions in the current year is not comparable with the prior year since included proceeds from tax motivated bond sales and from the sale of real estate 
with the flat yield curve available much of the year  higher returns were possible in spite of a shortening of maturities 
the average life of acquisitions was years  compared with years in and years in purchases of fixed maturity investments with shorter maturities caused the average life of the portfolio to decline to years at year end  compared with years at year end but above the year end level of years 
with acquisitions made at yields in excess of the portfolio average  the nominal portfolio yield increased to  compared with during and in emphasis continues to be on marketable  medium quality investments 
approximately of invested assets are fixed maturity securities  and of these holdings are classified as investment grade by the rating agencies 
the naic considers of the portfolio investment grade 
the portfolio is highly marketable  although its value fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
at year end  the unrealized loss of million compares with an unrealized loss of million at the end of and an unrealized gain of million at the end of distribution of maturities is as follows short terms and under year years years years years over years with an emphasis on fixed maturity investments  the percentage of holdings in other types of securities is inconsistent with industry data

market risk sensitivity 
market risk is the risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions 
torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  which is the risk that a change in a security s value could occur because of a change in interest rates 
this risk is significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed maturity holdings amount to of total investments 
the effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity because these investments are marked to market 
the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt 
interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark s insurance liabilities 
these insurance liabilities  net of deferred acquisition costs  were billion and debt was 
million at december   compared with fixed maturity investments of billion at amortized cost at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
insurance liabilities and debt are not marked to market 
market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives 
torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of high quality fixed maturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions 
a significant change in the level of interest rates  changes in credit quality of individual securities  or changes in the relative values of a security or asset sector are the primary factors that influence such sales 
occasionally  the need to raise cash for various operating commitments may also necessitate the sale of a security 
volatility in the value of torchmark s fixed maturity holdings is reduced by maintaining a relatively short term portfolio  of which matures within five years and of which matures within ten years 
also  the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for appropriate action 
no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
an interest rate swap instrument was entered into by torchmark in connection with its mips as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page of this report and in capital resources on page of this report 
a cap instrument was also previously entered into to protect torchmark from the market risk on an increase in rates associated with the swap on this security 
this cap expired during the liability for torchmark s insurance policy obligations is computed using interest assumptions  some of which are contractually guaranteed 
a reduction in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return to fall below amounts guaranteed 
torchmark s insurance companies participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations  the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the company s obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
those procedures indicate that torchmark s insurance policy liabilities  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets  are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmark s insurance activities in all but the most extreme circumstances 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and december  this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data is prepared through a model that measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments would have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in at at basis december  december  points financial condition liquidity 
liquidity pertains to an institution s ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark has very strong liquidity  as evidenced by its three sources of liquidity its positive cash flow from operations  its portfolio of marketable securities  and its line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations generate positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations were million in  compared with million in and million in in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million in investment maturities and repayments during  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at december   compared with million at year end in addition to these highly liquid assets  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities  which are available for sale should the need arise 
these securities had a value of billion at december  torchmark has a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings up to a specified maximum amount 
the maximum amount on this facility was million at december  interest is charged at variable rates for borrowings 
this line of credit is further designated as a backup credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time but may not borrow in excess of a total of million on the combined facilities 
at december   million in face amount of commercial paper was outstanding and there were no borrowings on the line of credit 
a fee is charged on the entire million facility 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
dividends are paid by subsidiaries to the parent in order to meet its dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
these requirements have declined in both and from the respective prior year 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations  excluding capital gains and losses  on an annual noncumulative basis  or of surplus  in the absence of special approval 
distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries has been and is expected to be more than adequate for parent company operations 
during the year  a maximum amount of million is expected to be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of long and short term debt  mips  and shareholders equity 
torchmark s debt is primarily its funded debt and its commercial paper facility 
an analysis of torchmark s funded debt outstanding at year ends and on the basis of par value was as follows principal principal year amount amount instrument due rate thousands thousands senior debentures   notes   notes   total funded debt   debt held by subsidiaries  long term debt   the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
during and  torchmark acquired a portion of its funded debt in the open market  through its insurance subsidiaries 
in  million principal amount of its notes due was acquired at a cost of million 
also in  million principal amount of its notes due was purchased for million 
in  torchmark bought million of its notes at a price of million 
insurance company holdings in the funded debt reduce consolidated debt outstanding 
in  all of the debt previously acquired by insurance subsidiaries was acquired from those subsidiaries by the parent company 
additionally  another million principal amount of the notes and million principal amount of the notes were acquired by torchmark in at a cost of million and million  respectively 
the redemption of this debt in resulted in an after tax gain of thousand 
during  torchmark received approximately million in intercompany note repayments from waddell reed as a result of their initial public offering 
torchmark utilized a portion of these funds to pay down funded debt 
it also took advantage of the lower interest rate environment in to refinance existing funded debt at lower short term rates 
in early  torchmark repaid million principal amount on its sinking fund debentures due in  of which million was a mandatory redemption and million was an optional repayment under the terms of the agreement 
on april   torchmark called the remaining million principal balance of this debt at the prevailing call price of  or million 
a loss on the redemption of debt was recorded in the second quarter of in the after tax amount of million  representing the difference between the total call price and the carrying value of million 
in addition to the call  torchmark s senior notes  principal amount million  matured on may  torchmark borrowed on its commercial paper facility to repay the sinking fund debentures that were called and to repay its senior notes upon maturity with accrued interest  in the combined amount of million 
the mips were issued in november  at a redemption amount of million with an annual dividend rate of 
they are subject to a mandatory redemption in full at september   although torchmark may elect to extend the mips for up to an additional years if certain conditions are met 
they are currently redeemable at torchmark s option at any time 
while torchmark is obligated to pay dividends at a fixed rate of  torchmark has in place a ten year interest rate swap agreement with an unaffiliated party 
the swap agreement calls for torchmark to pay a variable rate on the million face amount in exchange for payment of the fixed dividend by the other party 
the swap expires in torchmark is at risk on this instrument for higher financing costs to the extent interest rates rise during the remaining term 
at december   the variable rate was 
during  torchmark s after tax dividend cost for the mips was million  compared with million that would have been incurred without the swap 
torchmark s after tax cost in was million and in was million  saving million and million in each of those years  respectively 
effective january   torchmark changed its method of accounting for the swap agreement to recognize changes in its fair value  net of tax  as realized investment gains or losses 
this method of accounting for such instruments was believed to be preferable under the guidance established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for futures contracts sfas and the securities and exchange commission 
previously  torchmark accounted for the swap using hedge accounting under sfas the after tax cumulative effect of the change at january  was million net of income taxes of million 
the effect of the change on the twelve months ended december  was to increase realized losses by million 
per diluted share  excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
market value of the swap  which is included as a component of other invested assets  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
during july   torchmark filed a form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the shelf registration of capital securities in an aggregate face amount of million 
proceeds from the issuance of any such capital securities could be used for the possible purchase of torchmark securities  for working capital  for the repayment of debt  for acquisitions  or for any other general corporate purpose or business opportunity 
as of december   no capital securities have been issued under this registration statement 
short term debt consists of torchmark s commercial paper outstanding 
the commercial paper balance outstanding at december  was million at carrying value  compared with a balance of million a year earlier 
the commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmark s current cash needs 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was at december  in the computation of this ratio  the mips are counted as equity and the effect of fluctuations in security values based on changes in interest rates in financial markets are excluded 
this debt to capitalization ratio was at year end and at year end the decline in the debt to capitalization ratio at year end was caused primarily by short term debt paydowns 
the increase in this ratio resulted from the increase in short term borrowings 
torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest  taxes and discontinued operations to interest requirements was in  compared with in and in torchmark s interest expense rose to million in after having declined to million in the increase in was due primarily to an increase in short term borrowing costs which offset the lower amount of average debt outstanding 
the decrease was caused by a larger portion of total debt being short term debt that carries a lower borrowing cost 
torchmark has made share purchases from time to time under its share repurchase program on the open market when market conditions were favorable 
torchmark purchased million shares on the open market at a cost of million in and million shares at a cost of million in purchases of million shares were made in at a cost of million  subsequent to the waddell reed spin off 
torchmark will continue to make share purchases under its share repurchase program when prices are attractive 
share purchases could have a favorable impact on earnings per share and return on equity 
on november   torchmark executed a stock option exercise and restoration program through which torchmark directors and employees exercised vested stock options and received a reduced number of replacement options at the current market price 
this program resulted in the issuance of million shares  but over million of the new shares were immediately sold by the directors and employees through the open market to cover the cost of the purchased shares and the related taxes 
a similar option exercise and restoration program was conducted on december  for two executives not able to participate in the program 
under the program  thousand shares were issued but thousand shares were sold to pay the exercise price and taxes 
as a result of both of these restoration programs  management s ownership interest increased  and torchmark received a significant current tax benefit from the exercise of the options 
shareholders equity rose to billion at december  shareholders equity declined in  from billion at year end to billion at year end the increase of million in shareholders equity resulted primarily from the addition of earnings  less the payment of dividends and million of share purchases during the year 
the decrease was impacted by the decrease in the value of the fixed maturity portfolio due to increases in interest rates in the financial markets 
book value per share was at year end  compared with at year end after adjusting for the impact on shareholders equity for security value fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in financial markets  shareholders equity rose from billion at year end to billion at year end book value per share was at year end  an increase of over at year end return on common shareholders equity was in  compared with in the return on equity ratios exclude the mark up or down of shareholders equity for changes in security values caused by fluctuations in market interest rates 
they are also computed on a basis of net operating income before nonrecurring charge  as defined on page through of this report

in december   torchmark sold thousand vesta shares at a price of per share  recording a loss of million after tax 
in  vesta filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the public offering of its shares held by torchmark 
to facilitate the registration of vesta shares  torchmark re acquired the previously sold thousand shares at a price of per share 
on november   the registration statement was filed by vesta to offer all of torchmark s holdings in vesta

litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  most of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case  since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material

this statement establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of derivative instruments 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and be measured at fair value
