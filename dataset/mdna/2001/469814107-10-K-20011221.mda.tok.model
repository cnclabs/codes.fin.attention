item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  incorporated by reference in this report 
customers for the fiscal years ended september     and  revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government accounted for    and  respectively  of total revenues 
due to the amount of pass through costs see contracts below that may be incurred on construction and maintenance projects  it is not unusual for a client in the private sector to account for more than of consolidated revenues in any given year 
such was the case in fiscal when one client in the private sector accounted for of total revenues 
foreign operations for the fiscal years ended september     and  revenues from the company s operations outside the united states comprised approximately    and  respectively  of total revenues 
for fiscal years through  substantially all such revenues related to the company s offices in the united kingdom  ireland  france  spain and italy  with a small portion relating to the company s operations in india 
as a result of the stork acquisition parts of which were completed in fiscal and fiscal  we expanded our european operations into the netherlands  belgium and germany  and we acquired operations in south east asia 
as a result of the gibb acquisition which was completed in fiscal  we further expanded our business in the united kingdom  and acquired operations in the middle east 
revenues earned over the past five years from the company s operations in mexico  south america and australia were not material 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts undertaken by the company  our contracts can generally be grouped into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five fiscal years ended september cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of the company s contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
page when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a process plant  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table presents the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the five fiscal years ended september in millions cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts provide for reimbursement of costs incurred by the company plus a predetermined fee  or a fee based on a percentage of the costs incurred 
the company prefers this type of contract since it believes that the primary basis for its selection should be its technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price considerations 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum bid contracts 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  the company is first selected as the contractor  and then the contract price is negotiated 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where the company has the opportunity to perform engineering and design work before negotiating the total price of the project 
under lump sum bid contracts  the company must bid against other contractors based upon specifications furnished by the client 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period  that are reduced by the negotiation process 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to the company 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of the company s fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts  or lump sum bid contracts for services rather than turn key construction 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then the company will bear all or a portion of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  the company will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
page competition the company is engaged in a highly competitive business 
some of our competitors are larger than us  or are subsidiaries of larger companies  and therefore may possess greater resources than the company 
furthermore  because the engineering and technical support aspects of the business does not usually require large amounts of capital  there is relative ease of market entry for a new potential entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications 
accordingly  we compete with both national and international firms in sizes ranging from very large  to a wide variety of small  regional and specialty firms 
the extent of the company s competition varies according to the industries and markets it serves  as well as the geographic areas in which the company operates 
the company s largest competitors for engineering  construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel group  inc  fluor corporation  foster wheeler corp  washington group international  parsons corporation  kellogg brown root  and kvaerner
