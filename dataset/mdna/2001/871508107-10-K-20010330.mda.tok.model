the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the counterparties in derivative transactions are major financial institutions with ratings of a or better  as determined by one of the major credit rating operations services 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany sales 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the company s statement of operations 
a large percentage of the company s sales are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against every applicable currency could have had a million impact on the revenues of the company 
the company does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge expected revenues 
however  the company sources a portion of its raw materials in local currencies 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against every applicable local content currency would act as a partial offset to the impact on revenues 
the company  which manufactures a significant portion of its products in the united states  generally invoices its international subsidiaries in their local currency for finished and semi finished goods

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair market value based on their quoted market price 
as such  the company has exposure to market risk related to the fluctuation of cisco s stock price 
the company expects the change in fair value of the cisco stock price to be mitigated by the change in fair value of the embedded equity collar 
while components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources  the company presently depends on a single source or a limited number of suppliers for several components of its equipment  certain subassemblies and certain of its products 
this may have an adverse effect on the company s ability to deliver its products or to deliver its products on time or to manufacture its products at anticipated cost levels 
however  due to the general availability of components and supplies  the company does not believe that the loss of any supplier or subassembly manufacturer would have a long term material adverse effect on its business  although set up costs and delays could occur in the short term if the company changes any single source supplier
