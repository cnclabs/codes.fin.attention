item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as you read management s discussion and analysis  it may help to refer to our consolidated statements of operations on page  which presents the results of our operations for   and the following discussion should be tempered by the risk factors on pages through  which describe events that could influence our forward looking projections 
during the period covered by this discussion  we made significant investments to shift our sales strategy from an oem supplier to a branded supplier 
we also improved the accuracy and functionality of our products by acquiring fiber optic technology  which has added significantly to our operating losses over the last three years 
in the second half of we returned to profitability  as we experienced significant sales increases resulting from our investment in our new technologies 
during communications sales increased by percent  primarily due to the growth of our land based mobile satellite tracvision systems 
the tracvision lm product has been our most successful product launch to date  exceeding company expectations 
initial sales of tracvision lm represent owners  manufacturers and distributors of rvs and luxury motor coaches 
rv and motor coaches together represent a potential market for us of some million existing vehicles augmented by more than  new vehicles each year 
navigation sales increased during due to strong international demand for our products 
in the united states military began to transform its military from conventional  open terrain threats to a more adaptable highly mobile force 
based upon the new force configuration and we believe the market for military retrofits and new installations of our tactical navigation products appears very strong as a consequence of these strategic changes 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues years ended december  net sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss other expense income  net loss income before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased by to approximately million from million in communication product revenues made up of our sales growth  increasing to million from million in domestic communication sales grew by while international sales increased from levels 
we anticipate that international sales growth will accelerate in in response to new product introductions specifically designed for international markets 
we are optimistic that domestic communication sales will continue to grow  but at a slightly reduced rate from as weakened economic forecasts and rising gasoline prices may somewhat moderate last year s growth rate 
navigation sales increased to million from million in the growth in navigation sales reflects the acceptance of our tacnav products by international military forces where sales of our tacnav products were particularly strong 
we anticipate that navigation sales growth will accelerate in as the united states military begins to deploy vehicles that are equipped for the digital battlefield  a market that we believe holds significant promise for our tactical navigation products 
fiber optic navigation products began shipping in volume in and although sales volumes were not substantial  year end backlog grew to m 
overall  we anticipate that the rate of combined sales growth in will accelerate slightly from the growth rate experienced in however  a prolonged economic downturn or delays within the military procurement process could weaken our current growth outlook 
cost of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold consists of direct labor  materials  manufacturing overheads and engineering costs associated with customer funded engineering 
customer funded research and development costs included in cost of goods sold was approximately million in and million in during we realized material and labor cost savings amounting to of sales 
product cost reductions resulted from redesign of existing product and improvements in our manufacturing process 
we made significant efficiency gains in our procurement process by implementing supply chain management in the last half of the year allowing us to better plan inventories and negotiate lower material prices 
although manufacturing overheads increased in absolute dollars by approximately million in  overheads fell as a percentage of sales by from the prior year  reflecting increased capacity utilization 
total cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of sales by despite a sales shift towards lower margin communication sales 
looking ahead we believe that cost of goods sold will decline modestly as a percentage of sales from levels  resulting from higher levels of facility utilization and continuing manufacturing improvements 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of direct labor  materials  associated overheads and other direct costs resulting from the company s internally funded product development activities 
all internal development costs  including software development  are expensed in the period incurred 
internally funded development costs decreased approximately million or in from million in the decrease in internal product development costs resulted from a doubling of customer funded research 
costs associated with customer funded research are transferred out of the r d line into cost of goods sold 
a comparison of combined internal and external development costs reflects increased total research and development costs of million or a increase above levels 
development costs are forecast to increase substantially in  as we fully staff our photonic fiber and mobile broadband satellite communication product efforts 
photonics and the mobile broadband spending will result in significant research and development expense increases in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  cooperative advertising  sales literature  advertising  and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased by million in from million in the majority of the cost increase was related to variable selling expenses such as commissions  trade shows  media  and new product introductions 
the cost increase over the prior year was roughly half our annual sales increase and although spending increased in absolute terms  it decreased as a percentage of revenues by of sales to of revenues from in kvh utilizes independent  third party distribution channels including dealers  distributors  and sales representatives 
third party distribution allows us to grow rapidly without adding the fixed costs associated with a direct sales force 
accordingly  our forecast for anticipates marketing and sales to remain level with results when measured as a percentage of sales 
our spending forecast could increase should we decide to accelerate new product introductions or advance market opportunities that are not presently in our plan 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists of costs attributable to the company s management  finance  accounting  management information systems  human resources  facility management  and outside professional services 
general and administrative costs increased million or in over  but decreased as a percentage of sales to from in the previous year 
cost increases reflect annual salary increases  and rising outside audit  legal  and professional fees 
looking ahead into we anticipate that general and administrative costs will remain even with expenditures when measured as a percentage of sales 
factors that could increase spending include unforeseen legal or professional costs  or the hiring of key personnel not currently anticipated in the plan 
interest income 
interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash in federal short term obligations 
during the last nine months of we relied upon our bank line of credit and did not invest in short term obligations  decreasing interest income 
on december  we sold  shares of common stock to an existing shareholder for per share 
the additional capital raised will have a positive impact on interest income in interest expense 
interest expense is made up of interest charges related to our mortgage loan  our revolving bank credit facility and equipment leases 
we relied on bank borrowings for the last nine months of causing interest expense to rise substantially during the year 
bank borrowing to support our working capital demands in will decline resulting in decreased interest expense in gain loss on foreign currency translation 
the results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiary  kvh europe  are determined by re measuring its foreign currency denominated operations as if they had taken place in united states dollars 
gains and losses resulting from this translation are included in the company s net income 
income tax benefit 
as a result of generating operating losses for the past two years  the company has recorded additional deferred tax assets with associated deferred tax benefits 
the operating loss items giving rise to deferred tax assets are carried forward and may offset future earnings  before expiration beginning in the company s effective income tax rates were for and for the increase in the rate and related income tax benefit is principally due to certain reductions to deferred tax assets 
the tax rate of is the result of re evaluating the realizability of certain income tax credits previously established and made part of the company s deferred tax assets 
certain income tax credits were reduced in connection with the progress of an existing internal revenue service tax return examination 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million from million in  primarily due to strong communications sales that offset lower than expected navigation sales 
product sales were million in and million in with respective customer funded research of million and million 
communications revenues increased in to million from million in as strong sales of mobile television satellite systems for our new market in land vehicles exceeded expectations and our marine mobile satellite systems continued to sell well 
navigation revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of more than that was attributable to unanticipated declines in high margin military sales 
while we were selected for a number of high margin military products  revenues were lower than anticipated due to longer timeframes for completing contracts than we had expected 
navigation products incorporating fiber optic sensors in decreased to million from million in  reflecting the discontinuance of bus navigation products in late the bus navigation product was a legacy product acquired through acquisition 
the decision to withdraw the bus navigation product from the marketplace was based on excessively high post sales support costs that made the economics of this product unfeasible 
our acquisition of fiber optic technology in was driven by our need to incorporate more accurate sensors into our existing product offerings 
cost of goods sold 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased in to from in due to two opposing factors 
the positive impact of decreases in labor and material costs were offset by increases in manufacturing overheads  netting out to positive savings 
manufacturing overheads increased to million in from million in due to costs associated with initiating and scaling up production of new products and the under utilization of the tinley park manufacturing facility 
production volumes did not offset fixed manufacturing overheads at our tinley park facility 
in  we completed the integration of fiber optic technology into our navigation products and received our first orders for these enhanced products 
customer funded research and development costs of million in and million in were also included as costs of sales 
research and development expense 
internally funded research costs increased slightly to million in from million in we directed most of our research funds in to developing the new land mobile satellite television system and to integrating fiber optic sensor technology into our tactical navigation products 
we continued to increase internal funding of product development  which allowed us to better focus our research and decrease the amount of time required to bring a new product to market in total research and development expenditures  including customer funded product development expenditures included in cost of goods sold  were million in and million in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing costs grew more than to million in from million in major factors contributing to the growth of sales expenses were independent sales representative commissions  staffing  travel and new product introduction costs general and administrative expense 
we decreased costs slightly to million in from million in by improving cost controls 
interest income 
interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash in federal short term obligations 
interest expense 
mortgage costs and certain costs associated with leases are included in interest expense 
gain on foreign currency translation 
the results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiary  kvh europe  are determined by re measuring its foreign currency denominated operations as if they had taken place in united states dollars 
gains and losses resulting from this translation are included in the company s net income 
the translation gain decrease to 
million from million reflects changes in the strength of the united states dollar relative to the danish krone 
income tax benefit 
due to losses in both and  we realized a deferred income tax benefit of million and a current income tax benefit of million  respectively 
our effective tax rate in decreased by approximately to from in the decrease reflects a write down of deferred tax assets related to research tax credits taken from to we adopted this position based upon preliminary discussions with the internal revenue service 
liquidity and capital resources on december  we sold  common shares to an existing shareholder at per share 
we realized proceeds of million  net of transaction costs  that will be used to fund operations and advanced research into photonics and mobile satellite communications 
the agreement between kvh and the state of wisconsin investment board requires kvh to register the shares sold in the transaction on or before march  if kvh does not register the shares by march   we become liable for a penalty equal to 
of the value of the shares purchased for each week subsequent to march  that the shares are not registered 
we also received  in the month of december  a  customer deposit to fund a military order that will ship during and the customer deposit will be repaid to the customer by deducting amounts on a pro rata basis as product is shipped 
on march  we entered into a million asset based  three year  revolving loan facility at an interest rate of the prime bank lending rate plus 
any unused portion of the revolving credit facility accrues interest at an annual rate of basis points 
the loan facility provides for advancing funds based upon an asset availability formula that includes our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the availability formula sets aside a fixed amount of qualified assets that may not be borrowed against 
we may terminate the loan prior to the full term 
however  we would become liable for certain termination fees should we do so 
we believe that existing cash balances and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements for if we decide to expand more rapidly  to broaden or enhance products more rapidly  to acquire businesses or technologies or to make other significant expenditures to remain competitive  then we may need to raise additional funds 
other matters recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

and is generally effective beginning july  fin will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab expresses the views of the sec staff in applying generally accepted accounting principles to certain revenue recognition issues 
sab was adopted by the company as of the fourth quarter of  and had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
forward looking statements risk factors this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our previous statements 
impact of research and development expenditures on operating results 
for the past three years we have made significant investments in research and development that has contributed to operating losses in each of those years 
during december of we raised five million dollars to accelerate our research into two key product areas  photonic fiber and mobile broadband tv 
our product development expenditures in these areas may result in a continuation of operating losses 
impact of new products on sales results 
our future sales growth will depend to a considerable extent upon the successful introduction of new mobile satellite communications products for use in marine and land applications 
our success depends heavily on rapid completion of new products  particularly for worldwide internet and data applications and depends on other external variables that could adversely affect us satellite launches and new technology are expensive and subject to failures  and poor consumer confidence and or economic conditions could depress product demand 
dependence on military sales 
we need to increase navigation sales over levels to achieve overall profitability 
issues that could affect our success include funding for military programs may be shifted out in time  we are introducing new technological solutions that must be proven and then accepted  and sales cycles are long and difficult to predict in military markets 
continuing investment in fiber optics 
a large portion of our product development strategy for the near future relies upon cutting edge fiber optic product concepts 
expenses for fiber optic operations will add significant costs to operations 
as with any research and development project there can be no assurance that we will succeed with our development concept and produce a product that has market acceptance 
variability of our operating results 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon all the foregoing risk factors and how successful we are in improving our ratios of revenues to expenses 
volatility of our share price 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations  and this could continue due to variations in operating results  development delays of our proposed new products that could result in decreased sales  and stock market volatility caused by industry events 
hiring and retention of skilled personnel 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the photonics industry 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate  and retain highly skilled employees  particularly engineers and other senior personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to our product development  sales  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements and generate sales 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
protection of our proprietary technology  potential patent litigation 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
claims by other companies that we infringe their copyrights or patents could adversely affect our financial condition 
if any of our products violate third party proprietary rights  we may be required to reengineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products 
any efforts to reengineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful  and  in any case  would substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
although we are generally indemnified against claims that third party technology that we license infringes the proprietary rights of others  this indemnification is not always available for all types of intellectual property rights for example  patents may be excluded and in some cases the scope of such indemnification is limited 
even if we receive broad indemnification  third party indemnitors are not always well capitalized and may not be able to indemnify us in the event of infringement  resulting in substantial exposure to us 
there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims arising from the incorporation of third party technology in our products  and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from these claims  will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from their business 
a party making a claim also could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
increasing operating expenses  acceleration of research and development activities 
we have recently increased our operating expenses to take advantage of anticipated revenue opportunities related to our photonics and mobile broadband tv projects 
our decision to increase spending resulted from our desire to bring these products to market as quickly as possible in order to take advantage of strong market conditions 
should we continue to accelerate spending beyond current levels we could experience operating losses and negative cash flows 
ability to fund engineering projects 
the funding required to complete the development of new products might not be available when required 
working capital generated by operations may be substantially less than we require to fund both our photonic fiber and mobile broadband tv projects 
under such circumstances  we may not be able to obtain additional funding on reasonable terms and as a result  one  or both  of these projects could be terminated prior to completion 
start up phase of our photonic fiber project 
our photonic fiber project is currently in the initial development stage 
we may never complete the technological development necessary to realize the full commercial potential of the project 
we are developing photonic fiber products to replace electro optic components to create an active fiber networking solution that would greatly enhance the speed and power of transmissions over fiber optic networks 
our current approach utilizes advanced polymers and our d fiber technology 
the electro optic polymer we plan to use is untested in the core of an optical fiber and may not function in the same manner as it does in tests outside of the fiber 
in addition  our manufacturing processes may be incapable of successfully replacing the core of a standard optical fiber with the electro optic polymer  or the manufacturing process may be prohibitively expensive 
if we are delayed in our development of our photonic fiber technology and or are not first to market with this technology  we may be unable to achieve significant market share in the fiber optic networking market 
failure to complete development of our photonic fiber technology will also prevent us from developing a phase shifter based on that technology  which may impair our ability to effectively provide mobile broadband tv communications services to automobiles 
pricing of mobile satellite communication products 
the success of our mobile broadband tv project depends upon our ability to develop a technologically advanced antenna at an acceptable price for the automotive marketplace 
to date  phased array antennas have been developed at prices far in excess of what is practical in the automotive marketplace 
there can be no assurance that we can engineer a phased array solution within the pricing and technical parameters necessary to be successful in the automotive marketplace 
services of our ceo martin kits van heyningen 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of martin kits van heyningen 
the loss of the services of mr 
kits van heyningen could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also depend on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
ability to protect our proprietary technology 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property
