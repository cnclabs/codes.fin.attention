the company currently operates senior living communities in states with an aggregate capacity for approximately  residents 
the company currently owns communities  leases communities pursuant to long term leases  and manages communities pursuant to management agreements 
at december   the company s owned communities had a stabilized occupancy rate of  its leased communities had a stabilized occupancy rate of  and its managed communities had a stabilized occupancy rate of 
the company defines a community or expansion thereof to be stabilized when that community or expansion has either achieved occupancy or been open at least months 
the company s long term strategy is to develop and operate senior living networks in major metropolitan regions 
the company portfolio of communities includes large retirement centers and free standing als  with capacity for approximately  and  residents  respectively 
during  the company s retirement centers and free standing als generated and of total resident fees  respectively 
many of the free standing als are located within the same major metropolitan regions as the retirement centers and function as satellites to those retirement center hubs in order to form senior living networks and expand the continuum of housing and care into the market 
the company believes that this hub and satellite approach produces management efficiencies and market penetration by offering a range of senior living arrangements at various price levels 
during the late s and  the assisted living market has suffered from adverse market conditions including significant overcapacity in most markets  longer fill up periods  price discounting and price pressures  and increasing labor and insurance costs 
as a result  the company ceased its development of free standing als in late in order to focus on improving the performance of its existing retirement centers  filling its free standing als  increasing the company s cashflow and strengthening the company s balance sheet 
although the company abandoned its development program late in  during the number of free standing als operated by the company  or the free standing al portfolio  grew from four owned  three leased  and managed spe communities to six owned  leased  and managed spe communities  therefore the consolidated free standing al communities grew from seven to substantially all of these free standing als are in the fill up stage and are generating losses 
management expects these losses to continue until the free standing als reach stabilized occupancy  which is estimated to be approximately to months after opening 
the company has recently completed the expansion of two of its existing retirement centers 
in addition  the company is formulating plans to develop or expand certain senior living communities  but does not intend to initiate the construction of these projects prior to finalizing acceptable financing arrangements or obtaining satisfactory equity financing through joint ventures or similar arrangements

certain communities provide housing and health care services through entrance fee agreements with residents 
under these agreements  residents pay an entrance fee upon entering into a lifecare contract 
the amount of the entrance fee varies depending on the resident s health care benefit election 
these agreements obligate the company to provide certain levels of future health care services to the resident for defined periods of care  in some cases for life 
the agreement terminates when the unit is vacated 
a portion of the fee is refundable to the resident or the resident s estate upon termination of the agreement 
the refundable amount is recorded by the company as refundable portion of life estate fees  a long term liability  until termination of the agreement 
the remainder of the fee is recorded as deferred life estate income and is amortized into revenue using the straight line method over the estimated remaining life expectancy of the resident  based upon annually adjusted actuarial projections 
additionally  under these agreements the residents pay a monthly service fee which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services 
they may also elect to obtain additional services  which are paid for on a monthly basis or as the services are received 
the company recognizes these additional fees as revenue on a monthly basis when earned 
the company also provides housing to residents at certain communities under an entrance fee agreement whereby the entrance fee is fully refundable to the resident or the resident s estate contingent upon the occupation of the unit by the next resident 
the resident also shares in a percentage  typically  of any appreciation in the entrance fee from the succeeding resident 
the entrance fee is recorded by the company as refundable portion of life estate fees and is amortized into revenue using the straight line method over the remaining life of the buildings 
additionally  under these agreements the residents pay a monthly service fee  which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services 
they may also elect to obtain additional services  which are paid for on a monthly basis or as the services are received 
the company recognizes these additional fees as revenue on a monthly basis when earned 
if a resident terminates the agreement  they are required to continue to pay their monthly service fee for the lesser of one year or until the unit is reoccupied 
the company s management agreements are generally for terms of three to years  but certain of such agreements may be canceled by the owner of the community  without cause  on three to six months notice 
pursuant to the management agreements  the company is generally responsible for providing management personnel  marketing  nursing  resident care and dietary services  accounting and data processing services  and other services for these communities at the owners expense  and receives a monthly fee for its services based either on a contractually fixed amount or a percentage of revenues or income 
two of the company s management agreements are for communities with aggregate resident capacity for approximately  residents and terms of twenty years  with two ten year renewals and include a purchase option for one of the communities 
the management fee for these two agreements is equal to all cash received from these two communities in excess of operating and financing expenses and certain cash payments to the owner of the community 
the company s existing management agreements expire at various times through june the company provides development services to owners of senior living communities 
fees for these services are based upon a percentage of the total construction costs of the community

on december   the company sold a community located in westlake  ohio for million and subsequently leased the property back from the buyer

in december  the company announced plans to buy back up to million of its common stock to fund the company s contributions to its employee benefit plans for and at december   the company had purchased  or  shares of common stock  and considers the stock buy back program to be complete 
the company also announced  in march  that the board of directors had authorized the repurchase  from time to time  of up to million of the company s convertible debentures 
the timing and amount of purchases of these debentures will depend upon prevailing market conditions  availability of capital  alternative uses of capital and other factors 
as of december   the company had not purchased any convertible debentures 
purchases  if any  would be made primarily in the open market during free standing als and managed spe communities the company has a total of free standing al s 
since january   the company has constructed and opened free standing als  of which opened during the company has ceased development of new free standing als  and has only one free standing assisted living community that is not in operation 
the remaining free standing al opened in the first quarter of at december   the company managed of these free standing als for spes  including six spes which are affiliated with john morris  a director of the company 
the company is responsible for cumulative operating costs above specified limits for each of these managed spe communities  which costs are recorded as equity in losses of managed spe communities 
substantially all of the company s free standing als  including managed spe communities  are in the pre stabilized fill up stage 
as a result  the company expects its free standing al portfolio both consolidated free standing als and managed spe communities to continue to incur substantial losses throughout the company believes that the losses to be incurred will decrease each successive quarter  primarily as a result of increased occupancy at these communities 
the company s consolidated results will include increased losses from free standing als in versus  as a result of a full year of activity in for these communities opened during  an increased number of free standing als which are included in consolidated results as a result of acquiring various communities and leasehold interests during and  and increased equity in losses of managed spe communities as cumulative operating costs exceed the limits for which the spes are responsible 
the company has options to purchase or has rights of first refusal to acquire the leasehold interests in these managed spe communities  but is under no obligation to do so 
the company acquired of these leasehold interests and acquired one community during two of the leasehold interests and the one community acquired during opened during the first quarter of  and one of the communities was subsequently leased to a third party during the company is in discussions with the various spes to assume some or all of the remaining communities that are currently managed by the company 
the aggregate development costs of the communities was approximately million  excluding the working capital to fund operations during their respective fill up periods 
of the million of total development costs  million was provided by reit lessors  million was provided by first mortgage debt guaranteed by the company  and the balance of million was provided by the company in the form of notes receivable 
if offered and accepted  the company anticipates acquiring certain  and perhaps all  of those leasehold interests in managed spe communities during and if all were acquired  the combined purchase price would be approximately to million 
the timing of these leasehold acquisitions will depend on a variety of factors  including prevailing market conditions  the company s financing plans  the availability of capital  alternative uses of capital  and general economic conditions 
if the company does not acquire these leasehold interests  the company is still responsible for funding future operating losses which exceed specified limits 
liquidity the company has historically financed its activities with the net proceeds from public offerings of debt and equity  long term mortgage borrowings  term and revolving credit facilities and cash flows from operations 
at december   the company had million of indebtedness outstanding  including million of convertible debentures  with fixed maturities ranging from may to april and was obligated to pay minimum rental obligations in of approximately million under long term operating leases 
as of december   approximately of the company s indebtedness bore interest at fixed rates  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the company s variable rate indebtedness carried an average rate of as of december  as of december   the company had working capital of million 
the company s various credit facilities contain numerous financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain prescribed debt service coverage  liquidity  net worth  capital expenditure reserves and occupancy levels 
effective as of september   the company amended several of these financial covenants in order to remain in compliance therewith 
compliance with these covenants is dependent  among other things  upon improvements in the operations of the company s free standing als 
there can be no assurances that the company will remain in compliance with those financial covenants or that its lenders will grant further amendments in the event of such non compliance 
failure to maintain compliance with the financial covenants would have a significant adverse impact on the company 
most of the company s owned communities are subject to mortgages 
each of the company s debt agreements contains restrictive covenants that generally relate to the use  operation  and disposition of the communities that serve as collateral for the subject indebtedness  and prohibit the further encumbrance of such community or communities without the consent of the applicable lender 
the company does not believe the covenants relating to the use  operation  and disposition of its communities materially limit its operations 
a significant amount of the company s indebtedness is cross defaulted 
any non payment or other default with respect to such obligations including non compliance with a financial covenant could cause lenders to cease funding and accelerate payment obligations or to foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its payment obligations is likely to result in default or acceleration of a majority of the company s other obligations 
as part of its financing activities  the company intends to consider selective dispositions of communities that do not fit within its senior living network strategy 
the company s ability to sell any such properties depends upon the market demand for property  the equity in the mortgaged property  and the general economic conditions of the senior living industry 
the company has several significant debt obligations which will mature in the next two years  including a million revolving line of credit that matures on may  of which million is outstanding as of december   and million of convertible debentures that mature on october  the company must repay or refinance these debt instruments as they mature 
the company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and borrowings available to it under existing credit arrangements will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements and to fund its start up losses  and capital expenditure and debt service requirements during the company s internally generated cash will not be sufficient to meet the obligations of debt instruments maturing in due to adverse market conditions  the company believes that it is unlikely that it will be able to raise capital in the public equity markets for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the company s ability to repay or refinance its maturing obligations will depend  in large part  upon its ability to renew existing credit facilities and arrangements or to obtain new credit facilities or arrangements on acceptable terms 
the company is also focusing on generating additional cash from incremental leverage  including possible combinations of senior and mezzanine financing 
at the same time  the company is examining other alternatives for raising capital  including the monetization of investments in certain of the stabilized communities 
the company has engaged in preliminary discussions with its existing lenders regarding the extension of certain of the company s maturing credit facilities 
the company s ability to obtain new credit facilities and to repay or refinance its existing indebtednesses depends upon a number of factors  including the company s financial condition and operating performance  the financial strength of the assets to be encumbered  general economic conditions  general conditions in the credit markets  mortgage interest rates and other factors 
the company s efforts to obtain new or replacement financing will be adversely affected by the condition of the assisted living market in general  the insolvency or weakened financial conditions of many assisted living competitors  a reduced number of lenders willing to finance assisted living or retirement companies and the fact that the company is highly leveraged 
however  based upon preliminary discussions with certain of the company s existing and new lenders  coupled with banking relationships that the company believes are positive  the company believes it will be able to obtain new credit facilities and or extensions of existing credit facilities necessary to allow it to meet all of its financial obligations and requirements for indebtedness that matures during there can be no assurances  however  that the company will successfully negotiate and obtain adequate new credit facilities or extensions of its existing credit facilities  and if such financing is available  that the terms of any such financing will not impose significant burdens on the company or be dilutive to the company s existing shareholders 
the company s convertible debentures in the principal amount of million mature on october  it is unlikely that any of those debentures will be converted into the company s common stock 
accordingly  the company must repay or refinance those convertible debentures when they come due 
the company announced  in march  that the board of directors had authorized the repurchase  from time to time  of up to million of the company s convertible debentures 
the timing and amount of purchases of these debentures will depend upon prevailing market conditions  availability of capital  alternative uses of capital and other factors 
as of december   the company had not purchased any convertible debentures 
purchases  if any  would be made primarily in the open market during in addition  the company has engaged an investment advisor and is considering various capital raising and other alternatives to satisfy the company s obligations in connection with the convertible debentures 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to refinance  extend or otherwise satisfy its obligations with respect to the convertible debentures prior to their maturity or classification as a current liability 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
established reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under sfas no 
 the company would recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  measured at fair value  in the consolidated balance sheet 
in july  sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb no 
 an amendment of fasb statement no 
was issued deferring the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  in june  sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
was issued clarifying the accounting for derivatives under the new standard 
sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
during and  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against certain long term debt in order to manage interest rate risk 
these swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  it is estimated that adoption of sfas no 
will result in the company recording a net transition adjustment loss of million net of related income tax of  in accumulated other comprehensive income at january  further  the adoption of the statement will result in the company recognizing  of derivative instrument assets and million of derivative instrument liabilities 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab establishes specific criterion for revenue recognition 
in june  the securities and exchange commission issued sab b  which amends the transition guidance for sab the sec delayed the required implementation date of sab by issuing staff accounting bulletins no 
a  amendment revenue recognition in financial statements and b  second amendment revenue recognition in financial statements in march and june  respectively 
as a result  sab was adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of  effective as of january  the company s accounting policies are consistent with the requirements of sab  so the implementation of sab did not have an impact on the company s operating results 
impact of inflation inflation could affect the company s future revenues and results of operations because of  among other things  the company s dependence on senior residents  many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  during inflationary periods  the company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring its fees  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures

risk factors need to refinance certain debt instruments the company has several significant debt obligations which will become due in the near future 
these include  among others  a million revolving line of credit which matures on may  of which million is outstanding as of december  and million of convertible debentures which mature on october  the company must repay or refinance these debt instruments as they become due 
the company s internally generated cash flow will not be sufficient to meet these obligations 
any non payment or other default with respect to such obligations could cause lenders to cease funding and to accelerate payment obligations or to foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness 
the company may be forced to sell certain properties in order to satisfy these obligations 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its payment obligations is likely to result in default or acceleration of a majority of the company s other obligations 
the company s ability to refinance these instruments depends upon a number of factors  including the company s financial condition and operating performance  the financial strength of the assets to be encumbered  general economic conditions  general conditions in the credit markets  mortgage interest rates and other factors 
the company s efforts to obtain new or replacement financing may be adversely affected by the condition of the assisted living market in general  the insolvency or weakened financial conditions of many assisted living competitors  a reduced number of lenders willing to finance assisted living or retirement companies and the fact that the company is highly leveraged 
the company s ability to sell the mortgaged property depends upon the level of mortgage interest rates  the equity in the mortgage property  market demand for property  general economic conditions and the availability of credit 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to refinance these obligations on a timely basis  and if such refinancing is available  whether the terms will be acceptable to the company 
this inability to repay or refinance these and other obligations would likely materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
losses from free standing als the company has experienced significant losses and expects to continue to experience losses  associated with the fill up of a large number of free standing als which were recently developed or acquired 
newly opened free standing als are expected to incur operating losses during a substantial portion of their first to months of operations  on average  until the communities achieve targeted occupancy levels 
the company expects to acquire additional leasehold interest of managed spe communities during and which will result in additional losses 
in addition to its consolidated free standing al losses  the company is responsible for funding operating costs for various managed spe communities which exceed certain specified limits 
in addition  the industry is experiencing significant competition and overcapacity in the free standing al segment 
there can be no assurance that these free standing als will be profitable in any future period  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 
substantial debt and operating lease payment obligations at december   the company had long term debt  including current portion  of million and was obligated to pay minimum rental obligations in of approximately million under long term operating leases 
as a result  a substantial portion of the company s cash flow will be devoted to debt service and lease payments 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet required interest  principal  and lease payments 
many of the company s debt agreements and leases contain various financial and other restrictive covenants  which may restrict the company s flexibility in operating its business 
any payment or other default with respect to such obligations could cause lenders to cease funding and accelerate payment obligations or to foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness or  in the case of an operating lease  could terminate the lease  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to the company 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its payment obligations is likely to result in default or acceleration of a majority of the company s other obligations 
consequently  such a default would adversely affect a significant number of the company s other properties and  in turn  the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
need for additional financing the company s ability to sustain operating losses  maintain adequate levels of capital spending for its properties  and to otherwise meet its operating objectives will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms from available financing sources 
the company s future debt instruments may include covenants restricting the company s ability to incur additional debt  or otherwise restrict its operating flexibility 
moreover  raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities would likely be dilutive to the ownership interests of existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in securing additional financing or that adequate financing will be available and  if available  that the terms of any such financing will not impose significant burdens on the company or be dilutive to the company s existing shareholders 
highly competitive industry the senior living and health care services industry is highly competitive  and the company expects that all providers within the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future 
the company competes with other companies providing independent living  assisted living  skilled nursing  and other similar service and care alternatives 
although the company believes there is a need for senior living communities in the markets where the company is operating and developing communities  the company expects that competition will increase from existing competitors and new market entrants  some of whom may have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors operate on a not for profit basis or as charitable organizations and have the ability to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or through the receipt of charitable contributions  neither of which are readily available to the company 
the company also competes with many assisted living companies that are currently insolvent or that are likely to be insolvent in the future 
these competitors may gain a competitive advantage over the company as a result of the effect of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings 
furthermore  the development of new senior living communities has exceeded the demand for such communities in certain of the markets in which the company has or is developing senior living communities 
an oversupply of such communities in certain of the company s markets has caused the company to experience decreased occupancy  significant downward pricing pressures and discounting  reduced operating margins  and lower profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to encounter these conditions or that increased competition will not adversely affect its financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 
liability insurance and risks of liability claims the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  which arise in the ordinary course of its business 
the company maintains property  general liability and professional malpractice insurance policies for the company s owned and certain of its managed communities under a master insurance program 
recently  the number of insurance companies willing to provide general liability and professional malpractice liability insurance for the nursing and assisted living industry has declined dramatically 
as a result  effective in the third quarter of  the company has incurred significantly higher liability costs and premiums 
this change may impact the company s ability to obtain and maintain insurance at a cost acceptable to the company 
a continued material increase in insurance costs due to industry trends could also adversely affect the operating earnings of the company 
the company carries liability insurance against certain types of claims that management believes meets industry standards  however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to maintain such insurance  or that any future legal proceedings including any related judgments  settlements or costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 
community management  staffing  and labor costs the company competes with other providers of senior living and health care services with respect to attracting and retaining qualified management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of the company s communities and skilled technical personnel responsible for providing resident care 
in certain markets  a shortage of nurses or trained personnel has required the company to enhance its wage and benefits package in order to compete in the hiring and retention of such personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
the company will also be heavily dependent on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which it operates 
the company has experienced a competitive labor market  periodic shortages of qualified workers in certain markets  and increasing wage rates for many of these employees during the past year 
the company cannot be sure its labor costs will not increase  or that  if they do increase  they can be matched by corresponding increases in rates charged to residents 
if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified management and staff personnel  control its labor costs  or pass on increased labor costs to residents through rate increases  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
exposure to rising interest rates future indebtedness  from commercial banks or otherwise  and lease obligations  including those related to reit facilities  are expected to be based on interest rates prevailing at the time such debt and lease arrangements are obtained 
as of december   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with a major financial institution to manage its exposure of million of debt 
the swaps involve the receipt of a fixed interest rate payment in exchange for the payment of a variable rate interest payment without exchanging the notional principal amount 
see item a disclosure about interest rate risk for further description of the hedge transactions entered into by the company 
increases in prevailing interest rates could increase the company s interest or lease payment obligations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks associated with lifecare benefits certain communities owned or operated by the company are lifecare ccrcs that offer residents a limited lifecare benefit 
residents of these communities pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy  of which a portion is generally refundable  with an additional monthly service fee while living in the community 
this limited lifecare benefit  is typically a a certain number of free days in the community s health center during the resident s lifetime  b a discounted rate for such services  or c a combination of the two 
the lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident s entrance fee is refundable 
the pricing of entrance fees  refundability provisions  monthly service fees  and lifecare benefits are determined from actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population 
in the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for the communities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents  the results of operations and financial condition of the communities would be adversely affected 
residents of the company s lifecare ccrcs are guaranteed an independent living unit and nursing care at the community during their lifetime  even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the community 
in addition  in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the community where the resident lives  the community must contract with a third party to provide such care 
although the company screens potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets  income  and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to the communities during their lifetime  there can be no assurance that such assets  income  and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases 
to the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them  or in the event that the communities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of the communities  the company s results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
risks of operations in concentrated geographic areas part of the company s business strategy is to own  lease or manage senior living communities in concentrated geographic service areas 
the company has a large concentration of communities in florida  texas  and colorado  among other areas 
accordingly  the company s occupancy rates and operating results in certain of its communities may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including regional and local economic conditions  competitive conditions  applicable local laws and regulations  and general real estate market conditions  including the supply and proximity of other senior living communities 
dependence on attracting residents with sufficient resources to pay approximately of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  were attributable to private pay sources 
for the same period  of the company s revenues were attributable to reimbursement from third party payors  including medicare and medicaid 
the company expects to continue to rely primarily on the ability of residents to pay for the company s services from their own or familial financial resources 
inflation  a change in general economic conditions or other circumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors to pay for the company s services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
government regulation and the burdens of compliance federal and state governments regulate various aspects of the company s business 
the development and operation of health care facilities and the provision of health care services are subject to federal  state  and local licensure  certification  and inspection laws that regulate  among other matters  the number of licensed beds  the provision of services  staffing levels  professional licensing  the distribution of pharmaceuticals  billing practices and policies  equipment  operating policies and procedures  fire prevention measures  environmental matters  and compliance with building and safety codes 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement  the imposition of fines  temporary suspension of admission of new patients  suspension or decertification from medicare  medicaid  or other state or federal reimbursement programs  restrictions on the company s ability to acquire new communities or expand existing communities  and  in extreme cases  the revocation of a community s license or closure of a community 
while the company endeavors to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements  from time to time certain of the company s communities have been subject  like others in the industry  to various penalties as a result of deficiencies alleged by state survey agencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to similar penalties in the future  or that federal  state  or local governments will not impose additional restrictions on the company s activities that could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations see also item business government regulation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing  and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a major financial institution to manage its exposure 
the swaps involve the receipt of a fixed interest rate payment in exchange for the payment of a variable rate interest payment without exchanging the notional principal amount 
receipts on the agreement are recorded as a reduction to interest expense 
at december   the company s outstanding principal under its existing swap agreements was million and million maturing december  and july   respectively 
under the agreements the company receives fixed rates of and  respectively  and pays floating rates based upon libor and a foreign currency index with a maximum rate through july  of and thereafter 
during  interest rates had risen 
interest rates have fallen in early and are expected to fall further in the first half of the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  since the majority of the company s debt has fixed rates 
there can be no assurances  however  that interest rates will not significantly change and materially affect the company 
additionally  the company anticipates refinancing and or renegotiating certain debt in  which could result in higher interest rates in the future
