item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent events in january we began the construction of merritt at whitemarsh  a unit luxury apartment community  on of the acres owned next to our hammocks at long point community in savannah 
the million development cost is being funded by million in recourse financing 
the first units will be available for rent in late fall of and construction is expected to be completed in the summer of overview in our income came primarily from four sources apartment rents net of rental and interest expense  million  mineral royalties  thousand  property and development management fees  million  and sale of land and commercial buildings  thousand 
since we have largely completed the old merry land s development pipeline for equity residential properties trust during and  development fees will drop sharply in lower fee income will be replaced by rental income in one of our objectives has been to convert assets that do not meet our current investment criteria into cash and to put those funds into conforming investments in our chosen markets 
in addition to the land and commercial buildings we sold for million in cash in  we have also listed in for sale five of our older apartment communities which have less opportunity for cash flow growth than our remaining communities and which may require increasing capital expenditures as they age 
proceeds from these sales  should any or all of them be consummated  will be reinvested in newer projects with only a temporary reduction in rental income 
results of operations for the years ended december    and accounting predecessor 
while merry land has operated only since october  we are required to present financial statements for the years   and accordingly  only the consolidated balance sheets for december   and december   and the consolidated statements of income for the periods ending december   and december   are financial statements prepared for a real company 
the consolidated statements of income are for an accounting predecessor which has been constructed in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission as described in the notes to the financial statements 
rental operations all apartments 
at december  merry land owned eleven apartment communities  five of which were owned for all of and six of which were bought in august the old merry land had owned all eleven of these communities prior to the october spin off 
the following table describes the operating performance of all communities following the purchase of the six communities in august and the original five communities for periods prior to that

the purchase of six apartment communities in the third quarter of increased the weighted average number of apartment units owned to  in  from  in  and  in these six new communities contributed million in operating income in as compared to million in the increase in portfolio average rental rates in from resulted from higher rents at the company s continuing properties and the higher rents at the six communities acquired in in operating income increased by million from due to the million contributed by the  units purchased in august and due to the increase in average rents and the aggressive expense control on the five communities owned for all of and rental operations same store 
the following table compares the performance of the  units  which the company held for all of same store results to their performance in dollars in thousands  except average monthly rent  see footnotes on previous page twelve months change from change to rental income   personnel  utilities operating maintenance and grounds taxes and insurance depreciation and amortization   total expenses   operating income   average occupancy average monthly rent expense ratio for the year ended december  net operating income increased for the five apartment communities as a result of higher rental income and higher expenses 
the decrease in occupancy was more than offset by the growth in rent rates 
in the aggregate  the charleston and savannah rental markets were strong in both and as demand for apartments exceeded additions to supply 
charleston rents increased to  or  and savannah rents increased to  or  during this period 
charleston s citywide occupancy had fallen to at the end of  from at the end of due to an increase in the level of new apartment construction 
we believe the citywide occupancy could continue to drop to around at the end of and put pressure on our operating results 
total operating expenses  excluding depreciation for the year  were up 
the increase in maintenance expense was partially offset by the decrease in personnel expense and taxes and insurance expense 
maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher turnover costs and increased corporate repair projects 
taxes and insurance expense decreased due to lower millage rates in savannah 
rental operations commercial 
the company now owns three commercial properties in the augusta area after selling two buildings located in downtown augusta during occupancy for the two remaining properties  other than our corporate office  was less than at december  the net income before depreciation increased thousand in from a net loss of thousand in due to reduced maintenance and utility expenses and slightly higher occupancy 
gross rental income in had decreased from  primarily as a result of reduced occupancy following our spin off in land

mortgage interest income 
interest income from mortgage notes receivable totaled thousand in  down from thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the decreases resulted from the repayment of outstanding obligations in property management fees 
management fee income decreased thousand  or  to thousand in from thousand in due to the completion of the management agreements with equity residential on seven equity residential lease up communities and due to the acquisition in august of six other equity residential apartment communities that had been fee managed by merry land 
property management fees are expected to increase somewhat in due to the completion of lease up of the existing communities and the addition of new third party contracts 
dollars in thousands units fees units fees units fees equity residential development   equity residential joint ventures   other communities total   acquired on august  from equity residential properties trust limited liability companies 
development fees 
development fee income decreased to million in  from million in with the exception of thousand in development fees from godley station  a third party development contract in savannah  all development fees in  and were earned under agreements with equity residential whereby the company provided development consulting services for seven equity residential apartment development communities that had been owned by the old merry land 
at december  the development assignments with equity residential had been completed and we expect development fee income to decline substantially in long term gain 
during the company sold three parcels of land and two commercial buildings for a total of million and a gain of thousand 
in addition  merry land sold several acres of the brickyard tract in augusta for a gain of thousand 
other investment income 
merry land earned thousand in investment income from the cypress cove joint venture in in addition to the thousand the company earned in management fees

interest expense on the merritt at james island apartment community s construction loan totaled thousand in construction began in april and  at the end of  the company had borrowed million against the million loan commitment 
interest capitalized related to development in progress increased thousand to thousand in  from thousand in  due to the construction on the merritt at james island apartment community and the calhoun street condominium units 
interest expenditures are expected to increase in due to the completion and permanent financing of merritt at james island and the commencement of construction in january on the merritt at whitemarsh apartment community in savannah 
the total construction loan commitment on the merritt at whitemarsh development is million 
the million of senior debt  million of subordinated debt  and million of preferred stock obligations incurred in connection with the october  spin off were repaid in june interest expense  including dividends accrued on the preferred stock  totaled million and thousand for and  respectively 
the assets contributed to the company by the old merry land were not encumbered by mortgage debt at any time prior to the spin off in therefore  the financial statements for the accounting predecessor to merry land for periods prior to the spin off assume that there was no debt or related interest expense 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in and million in the increase was due to a greater number of employees  the fees related to the company s proposed stock rights offering  and increased acquisition costs 
expense for the period october  to december  was thousand 
for periods prior to the spin off  management has estimated common and corporate level expenses  which might have been incurred on behalf of the accounting predecessor to merry land by the old merry land 
impairment charge 
in conjunction with the likely disposition of several of our commercial properties  the company wrote down the carrying cost of several of these assets to their estimated value as determined in the company s formation and startup 
this produced a pretax charge in of million 
income before taxes and extraordinary item 
income before taxes and extraordinary item decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily related to the thousand increase in general and administrative expense  the million increase in interest expense  and the thousand decrease in development and management fee income 
these decreases were partially offset by the million increase in net rental income primarily from an increase in the number of apartments owned and the thousand gain from the sale of real estate assets 
in income before taxes and extraordinary item was million 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  general and administrative expenses estimated in the statements were considerably less prior to the spin off than after the spin off and there was no interest expense incurred prior to the spin off 
income taxes 
the income tax expense for was thousand that consisted of a thousand current income tax benefit and thousand deferred income tax expense 
the income tax expense for was million  which included a thousand income tax provision on the discount on repayment of the subordinated debt 
the income tax benefit in  which related to the period from october  to december   arose primarily from the impairment charge taken against several of the augusta commercial properties 
as a reit  the accounting predecessor to merry land was not subject to income taxes 
discount on repayment of debt and on redemption of preferred stock 
in june there was an extraordinary gain from the discount on the repayment of subordinated debt of thousand  net of income taxes of thousand 
the discount on redemption of the preferred stock was million 
funds from operations 
funds from operations was million for compared to million in the following is a reconciliation of net income to funds from operations 
dollars in thousands net income available for common  add depreciation of operating real estate owned   add long term capital gain loss net of tax effect add tax benefit resulting from permanent difference in book and tax basis less extraordinary gain less discount on redemption of preferred stock  funds from operations available to common shares   weighted average common shares outstanding basic   diluted   even though s ffo was only thousand greater than last year  recurring ffo is at a higher level compared to ffo in included million in development and management income from merry land s agreement with equity residential to complete our predecessor s pipeline and thousand in management fee income from the six joint venture communities that were acquired in august in addition  clay royalty payments decreased thousand as one of the royalty agreements expired 
however  as a direct result of the six apartment acquisitions  the apartment operating income before depreciation increased million and million net of the incremental mortgage interest 
the company believes that funds from operations is an important measure of its operating performance 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  or as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or as a measure of the company s liquidity 
the company defines funds from operations as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding all non recurring items and net realized gains losses  plus depreciation of operating real estate

the existing mortgage financing restricts any of the limited liability companies from making loans to the company  and distributions from each limited liability company may be restricted because of loan requirements to maintain adequate capitalization

the thousand received from both the esop and other notes receivable were offset by the thousand in mortgage principal payments 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million on december   a decrease of thousand from december  the million net cash provided from operating activities was offset primarily by the million used to acquire the ownership interests in six apartment communities  the million increase in mortgage escrows  the thousand to acquire the calhoun street condominium building and the million for improvements on the residential communities 
in addition  the thousand received from the repayment of a mortgage notes receivable was offset by the million lent to the employee stock ownership plan 
inflation 
substantially  all of the company s leases are for terms of one year or less  which should enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher rent rates in times of rising prices
