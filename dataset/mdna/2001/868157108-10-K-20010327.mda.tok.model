item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see cautionary statements 
acquisition of cardinal holding corp 
on july   we acquired cardinal holding corp 
through its merger with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the merger was treated for accounting purposes as if we were acquired by cardinal in a purchase business transaction 
the purchase method of accounting required that we carry forward cardinal s net assets at their historical book value and reflect our net assets at their estimated fair value at the date of the merger 
accordingly  all historical financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for periods prior to july  reflects only cardinal s historical financial and operating data 
financial and operating data relating to our business are included on and after july  cardinal s historical operating results were substantially different than ours for the same periods 
consequently  analyzing prior period results to determine or estimate our future operating potential would not provide meaningful information 
overview we are a leading provider of specialized oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the production related needs of oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico 
we believe that we are one of the few companies capable of providing most post wellhead products and services necessary to maintain offshore operating wells as well as plug and abandonment services at the end of their life cycle 
we believe our ability to provide our customers with multiple services and to coordinate and integrate their delivery allows us to maximize efficiency  reduce lead time and provide cost effective services for our customers 
over the past several years  we have significantly expanded our geographic scope of operations and the range of production related services we provide through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
recent acquisitions have expanded our geographic focus to select international market areas and added complementary product and service offerings 
we provide a full range of products and services for our customers  including rental tools  well services  wireline services  marine services  field management services  environmental services and other services 
our financial performance is impacted by the broader economic trends affecting our customers 
the demand for our services and equipment is cyclical due to the nature of the energy industry 
our operating results are directly tied to industry demand for our services  most of which are performed on the outer continental shelf in the gulf of mexico 
while we have focused on providing production related services where  historically  demand has not been as volatile as for exploration related services  we expect our operating results to be highly correlated to industry activity levels in the gulf of mexico 
for additional industry segment financial information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and our revenues were million compared to million for this increase is the result of an increased demand for our services in all of our operating segments  as well as the cardinal merger and the impact of our acquisitions 
as demand for our services increased in compared to  our gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced an increase in the gross margin percentages of our core business segments of marine and well services due to increased pricing and asset utilization  improved operating cost efficiency and the contribution of assets and acquisitions made during the year our overall gross margin increased to million in from million in the rental tools segment contributed our highest gross margin percentage in and the field management segment contributed our lowest 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in most of the increase resulted from our larger asset base as a result of the cardinal merger and our acquisitions 
depreciation also increased as a result of our million of capital expenditures in and our capital expenditures of million 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily the result of the cardinal merger and our acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased from in to in in october  we refinanced our debt  which resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  net of income taxes of million 
the majority of the extraordinary loss was non cash in nature 
in july  in connection with the cardinal merger  we refinanced our combined debt  which resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  net of income taxes of million 
this loss was also mostly of a non cash nature 
in  we recorded net income before extraordinary loss of million  or earnings per diluted share compared to a net loss before extraordinary loss of million  or a loss of per diluted share  in after extraordinary losses  we recorded net income in of million  or earnings per diluted share  as compared to a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  in comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and our revenues were million compared to million for due to the accounting treatment required for the cardinal acquisition  our operating results reflected twelve months of cardinal s operations  five and one half months of our operations after the merger and two months of operations of production management 
reflects only cardinal s operations on a stand alone basis 
even though we had increased revenues in  we experienced decreased demand in in all of our operating segments as a result of low industry activity levels 
as demand for our services decreased in compared to  our gross margins decreased to in from in our decreased gross margin percentage is primarily due to our marine segment 
since our marine segment s cost of services are primarily fixed in nature  our gross margin percentage may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization of our liftboats 
our rental tools segment contributed our highest gross margin percentage in and partially offset the decrease on a comparative basis since cardinal did not have a rental tools segment 
our wireline segment also experienced a decline in gross margin percentage in compared to our field management segment  which was acquired  contributed our lowest gross margin percentage 
of all of our production related services  the field management segment is expected to produce the lowest gross margin percentage since its largest cost of sales component is providing contract labor 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in most of the increase resulted from the larger asset base following the merger and the acquisition 
depreciation also increased as a result of our million and million of capital expenditures in and  respectively  and cardinal s acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is the result of cardinal s expenses for twelve months  our expenses for five and one half months and production management s expenses for two months 
in july  in connection with the cardinal acquisition  we refinanced our combined debt  which resulted in an extraordinary loss of million  net of income taxes of million 
the majority of the extraordinary loss was non cash in nature 
during  cardinal incurred an extraordinary loss of million  net of income taxes of million  in connection with a recapitalization and refinancing 
this extraordinary loss was also mostly of a non cash nature 
we recorded a net loss before extraordinary charges of million  or loss per diluted share 
after extraordinary charges  we recorded a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  as compared to a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  for liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  included in the million balance at december  was a million insurance settlement  which was received in late december  for the damages associated with one of our foot class liftboats 
in  we generated net cash from operating activities of million 
we supplemented our cash flow with an equity offering and our new credit facility that expanded our borrowing availability from million to million 
the equity offering consisted of the sale of million shares of common stock that generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the cash generated by our operating activities and the proceeds from our equity offering and borrowings to increase our asset base and enhance our earning potential 
we acquired seven companies for a total of million 
additional consideration  if any  will be based upon the respective company s average ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense less certain adjustments and will not exceed million 
these acquisitions expanded our business to include the rental of onshore and offshore accommodations and rig based well services  including workover  completion  snubbing  well control  sidetracking  re entry and drilling services and international markets 
we also acquired a division of a company for million  which provided us with an additional eight coiled tubing units and expanded our pumping and stimulation services 
we acquired six liftboats ranging in size from feet in leg length to feet in leg length for million  and we made a million investment in an oilfield services company 
we also made capital expenditures excluding the acquisition of the six liftboats of million 
these capital expenditures included the purchase of a new foot class liftboat for million  of which million will be payable in  and approximately million to further expand our rental tool equipment 
other capital expenditures included capital improvements to our liftboats and expansion of our operating facilities 
we have a term loan and revolving credit facility that was implemented in october to provide a million term loan to refinance our long term debt and a million revolving credit facility 
we amended the credit facility in december to increase the term loan to million 
under the amended credit facility  the term loan requires quarterly principal installments that commenced december  in the amount of million a quarter and then increasing up to an aggregate of approximately million a quarter for the last year until the facility matures on october  the credit facility bears interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
as of march   the amounts outstanding under the term loan and revolving credit facility were million and million  respectively 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility was per annum 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our ability to make capital expenditures  pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  make changes to our capital structure  create liens or incur additional indebtedness 
we have identified capital improvement projects that will require up to million in  exclusive of any acquisitions 
we have also entered into contracts to build three new liftboats for a total contract price of million  of which million is expected to be payable in we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
most of our acquisitions have involved additional contingent consideration based upon the acquired companies respective average ebitda after the acquisition 
in  we capitalized additional consideration of million related to three of our acquisitions  of which million was paid in january from borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additional consideration for all of our other acquisitions will not exceed million  but will be materially less than this amount if current performance levels continue for certain of these companies 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas no 
 as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
fas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
we adopted fas effective january  our interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment under fas  whereby changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity until settled  when the resulting gains and losses will be recorded in earnings 
any hedge ineffectiveness is charged currently to earnings  however  this is immaterial 
the effect on our earnings and other comprehensive income as the result of the adoption of fas will vary from period to period and will be dependent upon prevailing interest rates 
if we had adopted fas  our transition adjustment at december  resulting from the new accounting treatment would have been a receivable of approximately  and a corresponding credit of approximately  net of income tax  in other comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we make limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are traded with creditworthy major financial institutions 
at december   we were a party to interest rate swaps with approximate amounts totaling million that were designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
the swaps mature in march and october  and the weighted average fixed interest rate is 
at december   the interest rate to be received by us averaged 
we consider these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we would have recognized a gain of an estimated  had we terminated these agreements at december  at december   million of our long term debt had variable interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would increase our interest expense inclusive of swaps in the year by approximately  while a decrease would decrease our interest expense by approximately million
