also in  a restructuring charge million after tax  or

earnings in included net gains on sales of businesses and investments of million  or

results also included million 
per share from net gains on the sales of businesses and investments and restructuring charges of million million after tax  or 
per share  largely from employee severance  write down of assets  real estate lease terminations and charges related to redundant international television satellite leases 
in  the company completed the sale of telerate to bridge 
the purchase price consisted of million aggregate par value of year  redeemable  convertible  preferred stock of bridge  which was included in other investments  and cash of million 
under the terms of the sale  dow jones retained its guarantee of payments under certain circumstances of certain annual minimum payments for data acquired by telerate from cantor fitzgerald securities and market data corporation mdc under contracts entered into during the period when telerate was a subsidiary of dow jones contract guarantee 
the annual minimum payments average approximately million per year through october bridge has agreed to indemnify dow jones for any liability dow jones incurs under the contract guarantee with respect to periods subsequent to bridge s purchase of telerate 
in  dow jones acquired approximately million shares of savvis communications corp 
at cents per share for an aggregate cost of million and issued subordinated debt to bridge which had a carrying value including interest of million 
bridge is savvis largest customer and shareholder and a significant vendor for technical support services 
dow jones accounted for these investments under the cost method  therefore  changes in the value of the investment are not recognized unless there is impairment in value of the investment that is deemed to be other than temporary 
it is the company s policy to continually monitor investments for indications of impairment 
throughout  bridge experienced continued operating shortfalls from plan and experienced a need for substantial relief from its bank lenders and additional financing 
in the judgment of dow jones management  these developments  when combined with the pricing of its third quarter issuance of convertible notes  clearly demonstrated that there was a decline in value of the company s preferred stock holdings 
in addition  bridge notified its lenders that as of september  it was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its outstanding credit agreement 
bridge s principal shareholder had taken over management of the company and launched several initiatives focused on improving operations  increasing revenues and raising additional capital 
however  there was no assurance that these efforts would be successful 
these factors  combined with the lack of updated long term forward projections  left dow jones management with insufficient objective evidence to determine that the decline in value of the company s preferred stock holdings was temporary 
using the third quarter convertible notes financing transaction as a benchmark  dow jones recorded a charge to earnings in the third quarter of million on this investment there was no tax benefit as this was a capital loss 
also the company discontinued accruing dividends on its preferred stock holdings effective with the third quarter of the revised carrying value for this investment at september  was million 
bridge s financial position continued to deteriorate during the fourth quarter  and it continued to experience severe operational difficulties 
in december  bridge informed dow jones that telerate might be late in paying the february  quarterly installment under the data supply contracts described above 
subsequently mdc notified dow jones that if telerate failed to pay the installment amounting to approximately million  mdc would seek to recover such amount from dow jones under the contract guarantee 
during the fourth quarter and continuing into january and early february  bridge s primary investor  welsh carson anderson stowe  engaged in negotiations with bridge and its lenders in an effort to reach an agreement to restructure bridge s debt  arrange additional financing and significantly reorganize its operations 
however  those negotiations did not reach a successful conclusion and on february  bridge filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code with a view to seeking a sale of its assets in order to repay its creditors in whole or in part 
bridge s chapter filing had been preceded by an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed on february  by one of its creditors  but bridge s chapter filing rendered the earlier filing moot 
dow jones understands that telerate did not make the approximately million quarterly payment described above on february  mdc has commenced a lawsuit against dow jones seeking such payment and certain consequential damages that mdc claims have resulted and will result if dow jones does not make such payment 
dow jones has not made such payment and the litigation is proceeding 
in light of the foregoing events  dow jones has concluded that its bridge related investments have been further impaired  and are now worthless 
as a result  in the fourth quarter  the company wrote off million representing the entire remaining carrying value of the bridge preferred stock  the bridge subordinated debt and the savvis stock 
with respect to the remaining minimum annual payments due from telerate to mdc described above  dow jones believes that mdc and cantor fitzgerald have the obligation to cover  mitigate or otherwise reduce and or avoid any losses or damages under these circumstances  including by securing the best possible commercial terms for the supply of the subject data to a third party or parties 
dow jones believes that any and all amounts which are received by mdc and or cantor fitzgerald in respect of such data which dow jones believes is marketable and has considerable value would reduce any liability that dow jones might have under the contract guarantee 
there is a high degree of uncertainty  however  as to what value the data will have in the marketplace  whether an agreement will be reached by mdc and or cantor fitzgerald to supply the data to a third party or parties  the financial position of such party or parties  and the timing of any such agreement 
therefore  it is not possible for dow jones to determine with any certainty that any such offsets would in fact be realized  or at what time or in what amounts 
consequently  the company has established a reserve in the amount of million representing the present value of the total estimated annual minimum payments over the remainder of the contract term through october using a discount rate of approximately 
the amount of such reserve is reflected as a charge in the fourth quarter of the company will accrue the discount on the contract guarantee using the interest method 
in  the impact could amount to approximately million  which would be recorded as a non operating charge 
to the extent any offsets against the liability described above become certain or are realized in the future  or if the liability is otherwise reduced or eliminated  dow jones will reduce or eliminate the reserve as appropriate and recognize a special gain in the relevant period 
in addition  the company holds a minority interest in optimark technologies  inc consisting of preferred and common shares with an aggregate cost of million 
optimark has significantly restructured its operations and its most recent public filing indicates that there is some question of optimark s ability to continue as a going concern  principally because of negative cash flow 
management believes that the carrying value of the company s investment in optimark is impaired and that the impairment is other than temporary 
as a result the company recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of to write off the full carrying value of its million investment 
the following table reconciles the company s reported results to income excluding special items 
the term special items  as used within the remainder of management s discussion and analysis  refers to those items within the table

outlook the overall strength of the us economy is a key factor in the rate of growth of advertising volume and revenue of the wall street journal and other company businesses 
the slowing of the us economy which developed late in and continues into  prevailing general uncertainty about the prospects for the balance of the current year  and the discretionary nature of the timing of some client advertising spending  combine to create a greater than usual challenge in forecasting the company s financial outlook for linage at the wall street journal was down in the fourth quarter of  and is expected to decline about in s first quarter 
this compares to a linage increase in the first quarter of assuming a recovery in the us economy during the second quarter of  the company believes that linage comparisons will improve in the second half of the year 
advertising revenue will benefit from an advertising rate increase of effective january  circulation revenue for the wall street journal should benefit from a price increase for newsstand copies with a cover price of effective april  previously cents 
advertising linage at the community newspapers group is expected to be down slightly  however  this decline should be offset by an increase in rates 
the company expects modest growth in electronic publishing revenues 
in terms of expenses  the major newsprint mills have announced a price increase of per metric ton  effective in the first half of in order to offset the expected difficult revenue comparisons  the company has begun a cost reduction program 
the developing situation at bridge may also impact the company s results for most of the company s newswires contracts are directly with the end user  although some end users receive newswires through bridge terminals 
should bridge fail to perform under certain wholesale supply agreements with the company  the company believes it will be able to supply this information to affected customers either directly or through another distributor 
however  there could be a transitional period during which company revenue could be reduced by approximately million per quarter 
unless the liability under the cantor guarantee is reduced or eliminated  the amortization of the discount would result in a non operating charge of approximately million per quarter
