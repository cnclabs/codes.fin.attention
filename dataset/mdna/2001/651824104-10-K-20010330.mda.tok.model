item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements  as a result of various factors including those described below in risks relating to our business 
overview the following is a discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the results of operations and financial condition during the period included in the accompanying financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and associated notes 
in october  we acquired environmental optical sensors  inc eosi  a provider of high precision assembly and test equipment for the fiber optic communications market 
in october  we acquired the west coast commercial optics operation of corning oca corporation  a subsidiary of corning incorporated renamed newport precision optics corporation or npoc  which manufactures specialized precision optical products and systems 
in august  we acquired unique equipment co 
unique  a systems integrator specializing in the use of robotics for the fiber optics and semiconductor industries 
in december  we acquired the business of ce johansson ab cej  a swedish based global supplier of advanced metrology systems 
the eosi  npoc and cej acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
the unique acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this discussion includes the effects of the acquisition of unique for all years presented and the effect of the acquisitions of eosi  npoc and cej from the start of their respective acquisition 
amounts in include net sales of million representing one extra month of sales from the european operations 
the additional net sales stem from a reporting change in the second quarter of that eliminated a one month lag in the reporting of european results 
without the change  net sales would have been million  while net income would not have been materially different 
earnings per share were not impacted by the change 
results of operations financial analysis the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percent of net sales and as period to period percent increases or decreases period to period percent of net sales increase decrease net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense income from operations interest expense interest income nm other income expense  net nm income before income taxes income tax provision net income nm not meaningful page net sales for  and  our net sales totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net sales for increased million  or  as compared with  due primarily to sales increases in the fiber optic communications and semiconductor equipment markets 
net sales for increased million  or  as compared with  due primarily to sales increases in the fiber optic communications and general metrology markets  offset in part by sales declines in the computer peripherals and aerospace and research markets 
sales to the fiber optic communications market in were million  an increase of million  or  as compared with sales to the semiconductor equipment market in were million  an increase of million  or  as compared with sales to the other market segments  which include the general metrology  aerospace and research  and computer peripherals markets  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the prior year 
in  sales to the fiber optic communications market were million  an increase of million  or  over sales to the semiconductor equipment market were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared with sales to the other market segments were million  a decrease of million  or  versus for  and  domestic sales were million  million and million  respectively 
domestic sales in increased million  or  versus  due primarily to sales increases in the fiber optic communications and semiconductor equipment markets of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
all other market segments combined  including computer peripherals  aerospace and research and general metrology  increased million  or  over domestic sales in decreased million  or  as compared with the sales increase in of million  or  to the fiber optic communications market was offset by sales declines of million  or to the semiconductor equipment market  million  or to the computer peripherals market and million  or to the aerospace and research markets 
international sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  international sales increased million  or  versus international sales in included net sales of million representing one extra month of sales from our european operations  due to a reporting change in the second quarter of that eliminated a one month lag in the reporting of european results 
without such change  international sales would have been million 
the increase in international sales in as compared with was due primarily to an increase of million  or  in sales to international fiber optic communications customers  an increase of million  or  in sales to the semiconductor equipment market  and an increase in international sales to all other market segments combined of million  or 
geographically  the increase in sales were driven primarily from european  canadian and pacific rim customers with increases of million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively  over international sales in increased million  or versus the increase in international sales in as compared with was due primarily to an increase of million  or  in sales to international fiber optic communications customers  an increase of million  or  in sales to international semiconductor equipment customers and an increase of million  or  in sales to international general metrology customers  partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in sales to international aerospace and research customers 
geographically  european  canadian and pacific rim sales in increased million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively  over  while sales to latin american customers decreased million  or gross margin gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the gross margin increase from to was attributable to a mix shift towards higher margin product and system sales to the fiber optic communications market 
sales of these higher margin product and systems sales were offset partially by higher growth rates in sales to semiconductor oem customers  which generally have lower margins 
page selling  general and administrative sg a expense sg a expenses totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales for  and  respectively 
sg a expenses  which increased million  or  versus  were leveraged against the net sales increase of and primarily resulted from increases in expenses tied to the sales and profit growth 
sg a expense in increased million  or  versus  due in part to the inclusion of an additional month of expenses from the change in european reporting  which added million of expenses to  and to the inclusion of additional costs from companies acquired 
research and development r d expense r d expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
r d expenses represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
r d expenses increased million  or  in  and million  or  in as compared with the increases in both years were attributable primarily to increased personnel costs related to the development of a number of new products and product enhancements including extending the range of our automated packaging and test equipment product lines for the fiber optic communications market  technology enhancements to the laserweld and autoalign packaging workstations  and the development of laser diode burn in and characterization systems 
we are committed to continued product development and intend to maintain r d expenditures at a level between and of net sales for the development of new products and product improvements 
interest expense and interest income interest expense totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
although a majority of the debt is at fixed interest rates  we anticipate that interest expense for will decrease slightly from because the long term debt will be reduced by principal payments of million in the second quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
in july  we completed a secondary public offering of which net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and commissions were received in august interest income totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in the interest income is attributable to the investment of the proceeds from the secondary public offering 
taxes based on income the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
due to substantially higher pretax income in  tax benefits primarily associated with the company s foreign sales corporation and various tax credits did not have as great an impact on the effective tax rate as in the prior year  which resulted in a higher effective tax rate versus the increase in the effective tax rate for compared with was primarily the result of earnings attributable to the unique pooling combination for which a tax provision was not presented due to unique s s corp income tax status 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in our operating activities in of million resulted from the significant growth of the company in the usage was primarily attributable to the increase in primary working capital defined as customer receivables and inventories less accounts payable and deferred income taxes  partially offset by net income  plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
customer receivables increased by million  or  in  while the days sales outstanding ratio improved to days in from days in inventories increased in over levels  due primarily to production planning associated with our goal of maintaining competitive manufacturing lead times  and to the inclusion of inventory from cej in for which there was no comparable inventory in inventory turns improved to times in from times in accounts payable increased million  or  in compared with  primarily as a result of higher inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities in of million was attributable principally to the purchases and sales of marketable securities and property  plant and equipment  net of disposals 
page net cash provided by financing activities in of million was attributable principally to the proceeds from the secondary offering and the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and purchase plans 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in our line of credit and long term borrowings 
at december   the company had in place a million unsecured line of credit expiring may  and a million unsecured line of credit expiring may  both lines bear interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at the company s option  plus an unused line fee of per year 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under either line of credit  with million available under the combined lines  after considering outstanding letters of credit 
in march  we amended these lines of credit to be million each 
we believe our current working capital position together with estimated cash flows from operations and existing credit availability are adequate to fund operations in the ordinary course of business  anticipated capital expenditures and debt payment requirements  and for at least the next twelve months 
however  this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks see risks relating to our business  below  and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future 
although we have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies  we continue to evaluate acquisitions of products  technologies or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not need to obtain additional sources of capital to finance any such acquisitions 
european economic and monetary union emu new european currency on january   member countries of the european economic and monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing national currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and  during a three year dual currency transition period  either the euro or the national currencies may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and the national currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have implemented and are implementing plans to address the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions  and the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis  particularly once the euro currency is issued in while we anticipate that the euro conversion will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that key vendors  customers and distributors will not be affected by such euro currency issues  which could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
further  there can be no assurance that the currency market volatility will not increase  which could have an adverse effect on our euro exposures 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supercedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet at their fair market value and the corresponding derivative gains or losses be either reported in the statement of operations or as a deferred item depending on the type of hedge relationship that exists with respect of such derivatives 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments page and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
deferred the effective date until the year beginning after june  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
amends the accounting and reporting standards for certain derivatives and hedging activities such as net settlement contracts  foreign currency transactions and intercompany derivatives 
we will adopt sfas no 
in our quarter ending march  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
we review our sales contracts on an ongoing basis to ensure our compliance with sab no 
adoption of sab no 
had no material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow for the current or any prior period 
risks relating to our business our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors and or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock would likely decline significantly 
our operating results in any given quarter have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate 
these fluctuations are typically unpredictable and can result from numerous factors including 
the timing of customer orders and shipments within a given quarter  
fluctuations in the economic conditions of the markets for our products  
demand for our products and the products sold by our customers  
our ability to manufacture a sufficient quantity of our products  
variations in the mix of products we sell in each of the markets in which we do business  
our timing in introducing new products  
changes in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  
market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products  
the availability and cost of key components we use to manufacture our products  
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  
timing of our competitors in introducing new products  and 
our levels of expenses 
we may in the future choose to reduce prices  increase spending  or add or eliminate products in response to actions by competitors or as an effort to pursue new market opportunities 
these actions may also adversely affect our business and operating results and may cause our quarterly results to be lower than the page results of previous quarters 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results from operations  or any other similar period to period comparisons  are not meaningful and should not be construed as reliable indicators of our future performance 
in any period  our results may be below the expectations of market analysts and investors  which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to drop 
we are highly dependent on the growth of the fiber optic communications industry and on our customers who serve this industry 
a substantial portion of our current and future business comes from sales to companies that manufacture components for fiber optic communications systems 
the fiber optics communications market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions  changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of this market  their products and components may not achieve  or continue to achieve  anticipated levels of market acceptance 
if our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance with fiber optic systems vendors  it is likely that these customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products 
we often invest substantial resources in helping our customers develop products and manufacturing processes in advance of significant sales of our products to such customers 
a failure on the part of our customers products to gain market acceptance  or a failure of the fiber optic communications market as a whole to grow would have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations 
if we are unable to continue to meet the demand for our products in the fiber optic communications market  we may not be able to sustain our growth rate 
the fiber optic communications market has experienced significant growth over the past few years  and demand for the products we sell to companies that manufacture components for fiber optic communications systems has increased accordingly 
if we cannot significantly increase our manufacturing capacity  we may not be able to meet the demand for our products in the future and our growth rate may decline 
the markets and industries that we serve are subject to rapid technological change  and if we do not introduce new and innovative products or improve our existing products  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  shifting customer needs and new product introductions and enhancements 
products in our markets often become outdated quickly and without warning 
we depend to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance our existing products  to address the demands of the marketplace for new and improved technology and to be price competitive 
we may not be successful in developing  manufacturing or marketing new products on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we fail to adequately introduce new  competitive products on a timely basis  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we offer products for multiple industries and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of our markets 
we market products for the fiber optic component  semiconductor capital equipment  industrial metrology  aerospace and research markets 
because we operate in multiple markets  we must work constantly to understand the needs  standards and technical requirements of several different industries and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these industries 
product development is costly and time consuming 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  manufacture and test their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance 
our decision to continue to offer products to a given market or to page penetrate new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size  growth rate and other factors that contribute to the attractiveness of a particular market 
if our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive or our analyses of a market are incorrect  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
because our sales cycle is long and difficult to predict  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results 
many of our products are complex  and customers for these products require substantial time to make purchase decisions 
these customers often perform  or require us to perform  elaborate testing and evaluation of our products before committing to purchasing them 
the sales cycle for our products typically varies  is difficult to predict and can last as long as one year 
orders expected to be shipped in any one quarter may be delayed to subsequent quarters  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations could harm our results of operations and cause our stock price to drop 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate our employees  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our operations 
our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense  particularly for employees with expertise in fiber optics 
if we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need or to retain our employees  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we face significant risks from doing business in foreign countries 
our business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
in  and  our international revenues accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales  with a substantial portion of sales originating in europe 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our international operations  we face various risks  which include 
adverse changes in the political or economic conditions in countries or regions where we manufacture or sell our products  
challenges of administering our business globally  
compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements including export requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  
longer accounts receivable cycles  
overlapping or differing tax structures  
adverse currency fluctuations  
differing protection of intellectual property  
difficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual foreign operations  and 
trade restrictions and licensing requirements 
page as a result of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could affect the sales price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets  potentially making our products less competitive 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations could increase the costs and expenses of our foreign operations or require us to modify our current business practices 
if we experience any of the risks associated with international business  our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we face substantial competition  and if we fail to compete effectively  our operating results will suffer 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
we compete in several specialized market segments  against a limited number of companies 
we also face competition in some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop products that are competitive to ours 
many of our existing and potential competitors are more established  enjoy better name recognition and possess greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
other competitors are small  and highly specialized firms that are able to focus on only one aspect of a market 
we compete on the basis of product features  quality  reliability and price and on our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may force us to reduce our prices  which could negatively affect our operating results 
if we do not respond adequately to competitive challenges  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
acquisitions of additional business  products or technologies we may make could negatively affect our business 
we have historically achieved growth through a combination of internally developed new products and acquisitions 
since august we have acquired four companies  and as part of our strategy to sustain growth  we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies  technologies and complementary product lines in the future 
each of our recent acquisitions involves  and any future acquisition would involve risks  including 
our ability to integrate the acquired business operations  products and personnel  
our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  
our ability to manufacture and sell the products of the acquired businesses  
a decline in demand by our customers for the acquired business products  
our ability to expand our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to incorporate the acquired businesses  
diversion of management s time and attention  
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the products or services of an acquired firm  
assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances  and 
the need to record significant one time charges or amortize intangible assets  which could lower our reported earnings 
we cannot assure you that any business that we may acquire will achieve anticipated revenues and operating results  which could decrease the value of the acquisition to us 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
page if we are delayed in introducing our new products into the marketplace  or if our new products contain defects  our operating results will suffer 
because our products are sophisticated and complex  we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products 
if we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion  our customers may choose to use competitors products 
our inability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
our products may also contain defects or undetected errors 
as a result  we could incur substantial expenses in fixing any defects or undetected errors  which could result in damage to our competitive position and harm our business and results of operations 
we rely on several sole source and limited source suppliers 
we obtain some of the materials used to build our systems and subsystems  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  from single or limited sources due to unique component designs as well as specialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
if our components or raw materials are unavailable in adequate amounts or are unavailable on satisfactory terms  we may be required to purchase them from alternative sources  if available  which could increase our costs and cause delays in the production and distribution of our products 
if we do not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
many of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver the quantities of components that we need 
if we fail to accurately forecast our needs  or if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of components that we use to manufacture our products  then delays or reductions in production and shipment could occur  which would harm our business and results of operations 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt or shut down our operations 
our operations are susceptible to damages from earthquakes  floods  fire  loss of power or water supplies  or other similar contingencies 
we have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity 
if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility  any of which would harm our business 
in addition  a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located in california  which has recently experienced ongoing power shortages  which have resulted in rolling blackouts 
these blackouts  which are expected to continue at least through  could cause disruptions to our operations and the operations of certain of our suppliers  distributors and customers 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes and power outages 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign exchange rates which may generate translation and transaction gains and losses and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
international operations constituted approximately of our consolidated operating profit 
as page currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit include the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  swedish krona and swiss franc 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would have affected reported operating profit by approximately million for the year ended december  we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary s functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our earnings for the last three years 
the impact of unrealized foreign exchange translation gains and losses is disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to our unsecured lines of credit and our investments in marketable securities 
our lines of credit bear interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at our option 
no amounts were outstanding under these lines of credit as of december  our long term debt instruments carry fixed interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities  which total million at december   are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we estimate that a decline in the interest earned on our investment portfolio would have resulted in an after tax decline in our net income of million for the year ended december  the sensitivity analyses presented in the interest rate and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
