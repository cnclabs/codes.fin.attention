the company incurred a substantial operating loss in principally as the result of operating problems experienced at the company s bear creek and memphis facilities during the fourth quarter 
during  the company initiated several new waste processing strategies in order to respond to changing market conditions 
these new strategies included the processing of steam generators from nuclear power plants  a new contaminated metals handling process and an enhanced radioactive assay process 
delays in the start up of these new waste processing strategies  originally scheduled to begin early in the second half of the year  led to a build up of waste on site in the fourth quarter 
as a result  the company incurred high labor costs and ultimately a costly shipping and burial campaign in an effort to reduce the amount of on site waste and to safely handle more than twice the waste ever processed in a calendar quarter using these new processes 
the company s systems did not reveal the operational issues associated with the new waste processing strategies in a timely manner 
the operational problems at the company s bear creek and memphis facilities are also expected to adversely affect the company s results for the first quarter of the company s management has been working to address the operational issues that resulted in the operating performance of the company s commercial waste processing operations in the fourth quarter of by  among other things  strengthening management resources and reporting  implementing personnel changes  modifying waste processing  storage  transportation and burial methods and improving cost accounting systems utilized at its commercial waste processing locations

the company determined  in the course of its review  that full reconciliations of quarterly inventories of unprocessed waste were not performed at each quarter end in the appropriate recording of revenues was complicated by the high volumes of wastes and newly implemented waste processing strategies

forward looking information in response to the safe harbor provisions contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is including in this annual report on form k the following cautionary statements which are intended to identify certain important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
many of these factors have been discussed in prior filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s future operating results are largely dependent upon the company s ability to manage its commercial waste processing operations  including obtaining commercial waste processing contracts and processing the waste under such contracts in a timely and cost effective manner 
in addition  the company s future operating results are dependent upon the timing and awarding of contracts by the doe for the cleanup of other waste sites administered by it 
the timing and award of such contracts by the doe is directly related to the response of governmental authorities to public concerns over the treatment and disposal of radioactive  hazardous  mixed and other wastes 
the lessening of public concern in this area or other changes in the political environment could adversely affect the availability and timing of government funding for the cleanup of doe and other sites containing radioactive and mixed wastes 
additionally  revenues from technical support services have in the past and continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues and loss of one or more technical support service contracts could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s future operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as the timing of new commercial waste processing contracts and duration of and amount of waste to be processed pursuant to those contracts  the acceptance and implementation of the company s waste treatment technologies in the government and commercial sectors  the evaluation by the doe and commercial customers of the company s technologies versus other competing technologies as well as conventional storage and disposal alternatives  the timing of new government waste processing projects  including those pursued jointly with others  the duration of such projects  and the timing of outage support projects and other large technical support services projects at its customers facilities 
a primary element of the company s growth strategy is to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that expand and complement the company s business  technologies and service offerings
