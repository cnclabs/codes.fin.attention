due to these and additional factors  certain statements  historical results and percentage relationships discussed below will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
ultratech develops  manufactures and markets photolithography equipment steppers designed to reduce the cost of manufacturing integrated circuits ics  including advanced packaging processes  thin film heads tfhs for disk drives and micromachined components 
the company supplies step and repeat systems based on one to one and reduction optical technologies to customers located throughout north america  europe  japan and the rest of asia 
these products range from low cost systems for high volume manufacturing to advanced systems for cost effective production of leading edge devices and for research and development applications 
on june   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of integrated solutions  inc isi  a privately held manufacturer of i line and deep ultra violet reduction lithography systems the acquisition for approximately million in cash  million in transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities 
in april  the company reached a decision to shut down its ultrabeam operations 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized a charge of million  or per share diluted 
in june  the company settled litigation it had initiated against nikon inc nikon 
in conjunction with the settlement agreement  the company may recognize licensing revenue in future quarters consistent with the terms of settlement 
the company is presently proceeding with related actions against canon inc canon and asm lithography  ltd 
asm 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in those actions 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with applied materials  inc applied materials under which applied materials has licensed the laser thermal processing technology of the company s verdant technologies division 
additionally  ultratech develops  manufactures and markets its own laser thermal processing systems used in the development and future production of advanced devices 
in september  the company exercised an option it held to purchase acres of undeveloped land it leased in san jose  california and sold this property to a third party 
this transaction resulted in a net gain of million before related income taxes  or per share diluted 
the applied materials and nikon agreements and the land sale resulted in special income tax charges during the year ended december  of million  or per share diluted 
the company previously recognized revenue from the sales of its systems generally upon shipment  which usually preceded installation and final customer acceptance  provided that final customer acceptance and collection of the related receivable were probable 
effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for system sales to recognize such revenues when the contractual obligations for installation and customer acceptance have been satisfied  provided collections of the related receivable are probable 
the company believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
in conjunction with this change in accounting method  the company recognized a charge in the quarter ended march  of million  or per share diluted  representing the cumulative effect on prior years of the application of sab results of operations the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and most likely will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
factors that have caused operating results to fluctuate significantly in the past and most likely will continue to cause fluctuations in the future include those mentioned above as well as inventory and open purchase commitment reserve positions  concentration of credit risk  lengthy development cycles for new products  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of the company s existing products  delayed shipments to customers due to customer configuration changes and other factors  acquisition activities requiring issuance of additional equity or debt securities  the expenditure of cash and the devotion of substantial management resources  lengthy manufacturing cycles for the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the startup of new product introductions  patterns of capital spending by customers  product discounts  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors or suppliers  shutdown of operations  sale of assets  outcome of litigation  political and economic instability throughout the world  in particular the asia pacific region  changes in sales or distribution agreements  natural disasters  regulatory changes  and business interruptions related to the company s occupation of its facilities  including related to the recent energy crisis in california  where the company s headquarters and principal operations are located 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and most likely will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products sold  product discounts and competition in the company s targeted markets  inventory and open purchase commitment reserve provisions  the rate of capacity utilization  nonlinearity of shipments during the quarter  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing costs until manufacturing efficiencies are realized and are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs  and the implementation of subcontracting arrangements 
the company derives a substantial portion of its total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from  to million for the company s x steppers  and million to more than million for the company s reduction steppers 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing of recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and most likely will continue to have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results for any particular period 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve the company s sales objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  shipment or customer acceptance delays  and deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  the company s net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon the company obtaining orders for systems to be shipped and accepted in the same period in which the order is received 
the company s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment and customer acceptance during a particular period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the company s shipments has historically been realized near the end of each quarter 
delays in installation and customer acceptance due  for example  to the inability of the company to successfully demonstrate the agreed upon specifications or criteria at the customer s facility  or to the failure of the customer to permit installation of the system in the agreed upon time  may cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  which may materially adversely affect the company s operating results for such period 
additionally  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments due  for example  to reschedulings  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  have caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  which has and could continue to materially adversely affect the company s operating results for such period 
in particular  the long manufacturing cycles of the company s saturn wafer stepper registered trademark  and the company s reduction stepper product offerings  and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
the company s business has in prior years been subject to seasonality  although the company believes such seasonality has been masked in recent years by cyclical trends within the semiconductor and thin film head industries 
in addition  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment  ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for the company to reduce its operating expenses in a particular period if the company fails to achieve its net sales goals for the period 
net sales vs 
net sales consist of revenues from system sales  spare parts sales  service and licensing of technologies 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  an increase of as compared with net sales of million for system sales increased  to million  as a result of a increase in unit shipments  a product mix shift toward higher priced systems and an increase in weighted average selling prices 
the year over year improvement in system sales was primarily attributable to improved conditions within the semiconductor industry  which have resulted in higher capital spending levels 
revenues from services declined  to million  primarily as a result of fewer reduction steppers under service contract 
revenues from licensing and licensing support increased to million  from in  as a result of licensing agreements entered in spare part sales declined  to million  primarily as a result of fewer system upgrades 
approximately of the company s net sales for the year ended december  resulted from systems shipped in at december   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue resulting from systems shipped but not yet installed and accepted  as compared with million at december  all of the revenue deferred at december  was recognized during total company backlog  including systems shipped but not yet installed and accepted  was approximately million as of december   as compared with million as of december  the net result of shipments and acceptances during the year ended december  was a net reduction in deferred product and service income of approximately million after giving effect to the cumulative adjustment resulting from the implementation of sab 
during the year ended december   deferred license income increased by million  as a result of proceeds from licensing and licensing support agreements entered into in deferred income relative to the company s products is recognized upon installation and customer acceptance of the systems 
deferred income relative to service revenue is recognized over the life of the related service contract 
deferred income relative to the company s licensing activities is recognized over the longer of the estimated useful life of the licensed technologies  or the period of any technology transfer support arrangements 
the company has substantially changed its operations to implement sab the company estimates that its sales for the year ended december  would have approximated million under its previous method of accounting for revenue recognition 
however  the company believes that estimates of its system revenue under its prior method of accounting are not indicative of results that would have been achieved had the company not substantially changed its operations to implement sab on a market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with system sales of million in sales to the microsystems market  which includes sales to thin film head manufacturers  were million  a decline of as compared with sales of million in the company believes that this decline was primarily attributable to the continued excess capacity situation within the thin film head industry 
the increased sales to the semiconductor industry were primarily a result of improved conditions within the industry and higher sales of the company s saturn spectrum wafer stepper  which addresses the market for advanced packaging of integrated circuits 
during the year ended december   the company recognized revenue for its first mm saturn spectrum wafer stepper  for advanced packaging applications  and its first verdant laser thermal processing system  sold for research and development applications 
additionally  during  the company recognized revenue for its first nm xls reduction stepper system  sold for research and development applications 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in unit sales of the company s model  which serves the market for back end thin film head production 
the thin film head industry is currently experiencing a period of excess capacity  and the company presently anticipates that this trend will continue for at least the next several quarters  which will continue to materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales for the increase in international sales  in terms of absolute dollars  was primarily attributable to increased sales of the company s saturn spectrum to semiconductor companies in japan and asia  excluding japan  partially offset by lower sales to thin film head customers in asia  excluding japan 
the company anticipates that an increasing percentage of its overall sales will come from semiconductor manufacturers in japan and asia  excluding japan  utilizing the company s systems in the process of advanced semiconductor packaging 
the company s operations in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  orders are typically denominated in japanese yen 
this may subject the company to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure through the use of foreign exchange contracts  however  there can be no assurance of the success of any such efforts 
international sales expose the company to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which  in turn  impact the relative cost of ownership of the company s products 
see additional risk factors international sales  japanese market 
although the company s backlog of system orders increased substantially during the year ended december   the anticipated timing of shipments and customer acceptances of those orders will require the company to fill a number of production slots in the current period in order to meet its near term sales targets 
additionally  the company is presently experiencing an increased level of customer rescheduling of deliveries 
if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to secure those production orders  or if existing production orders are delayed or cancelled  its results of operations will be materially adversely impacted in the near term 
accordingly  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current or prior level of sales 
the company believes that demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may currently be experiencing a cyclical downturn 
as a result  the company may experience lower order booking rates in the near term  relative to those achieved in  and may experience an increased incidence of order deferrals  rescheduling and cancellations 
fewer net bookings would result in lower net sales and gross margin  which would materially adversely impact the company s business and results of operations 
the company presently expects that net sales for the three month period ending march  may be substantially higher than net sales in the comparable period in however  due to current production limitations  customer delivery dates and uncertainty as to customer acceptances  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current or prior sales levels 
because the company s net sales are subject to a number of risks  including intense competition in the capital equipment industry and the timing and market acceptance of the company s products  there can be no assurance that the company will exceed or maintain its current or prior level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  the company believes that the market acceptance and volume production of its saturn spectrum  its xls advanced reduction steppers and its series family of wafer steppers  are of critical importance to its future financial results 
to the extent that these products do not achieve significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for such products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor on thin film industry  customer acceptances  or any other reason  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
vs 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  an increase of as compared with net sales of million for the increase  relative to  was primarily attributable to improved conditions within the semiconductor industry  which have resulted in higher capital spending levels  partially offset by lower front end equipment sales to the thin film head industry 
for the year ended december   the company s unit system shipments increased  relative to  while the weighted average selling price of all systems sold declined slightly 
service revenue increased for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the product lines and related service business of isi in june of net sales of spare parts and product upgrades declined for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december   international net sales were million  as compared with million for  an increase of 
international net sales represented of total net sales for the year ended december   as compared with for this year over year increase  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributed to sales to back end thin film head manufacturers in asia  excluding japan 
however  the company continues to be cautious in its outlook for the asian markets 
gross profit vs 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  was for the year ended december   as compared with a gross margin of for on a comparative basis  gross margins were adversely impacted by a shift in product mix toward the company s more advanced x lithography systems and reduction steppers  which generally have lower gross margin percentages than the company s more mature product lines 
additionally  comparisons with the prior year were adversely impacted by lower margins on service revenues and higher inventory reserve requirements 
however  these adverse trends were offset by higher license revenues million in  as compared with in  higher weighted average system selling prices and from manufacturing efficiencies achieved as a result of higher production levels 
the company believes that gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter ending march  may be significantly higher than levels achieved during the comparable period a year ago  primarily as a result of increased licensing income  improved product pricing and higher levels of capacity utilization 
however  intense competition in the markets the company serves may make it difficult for the company to increase or maintain its current gross margin percentages in the near term 
the company is presently increasing inventory purchases based on current and forecasted demand for its saturn spectrum wafer stepper  its verdant laser thermal processing system and its nm advanced reduction stepper 
the purchase of such additional inventories will result in a higher risk of obsolescence  which may require inventory write offs  which would negatively impact gross margins 
additionally  new products generally have lower gross margins until there is widespread market acceptance and until production and after sales efficiencies can be achieved 
should the saturn spectrum  verdant laser thermal processing system or the company s reduction stepper offerings  fail to develop or generate significant market demand  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
vs 
the company s gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared with a gross loss as a percentage of net sales of for in  the company recognized million in special charges related primarily to the write down of inventories and provisions for estimated losses associated with open purchase commitments 
these charges were primarily a result of the company s lower sales and bookings levels in  revised sales demand forecasts for and delays in the production readiness of the company s electron beam lithography system 
in addition to the special charges recognized in  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in can be further attributed to significantly higher capacity utilization  favorable changes in product mix  and a lower percentage of service revenue relative to total net sales  which typically has lower standard margins than system sales  partially offset by lower weighted average selling prices 
research  development and engineering expenses vs 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared with million for this decrease in spending was primarily attributable to the shutdown of the company s ultrabeam operations  which occurred early in the second quarter of  and lower spending on the company s laser thermal processing technology  partially offset by higher spending on the company s reduction stepper technologies and higher facilities and personnel costs 
the company continues to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of its verdant laser thermal processing systems and technologies  together with continuing expenditures for its x and reduction optical products and technologies 
the company presently expects that the absolute dollar amount of research  development and engineering expenses for the quarter ending march  may be higher than levels incurred in the comparable period in  as the decline in spending relative to the ultrabeam shutdown is anticipated to be more than offset by increased investments in the company s verdant and photolithography technologies  together with higher facilities and personnel costs 
vs 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses were million for  as compared with million for the company continued to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of its ultrabeam electron beam lithography system and its verdant rapid thermal annealing laser doping systems and technologies  together with continued expenditures for its x and reduction optical products and technologies 
amortization of goodwill vs 
amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the comparable period in the additional amortization expense was directly related to intangible assets purchased in december vs 
amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the comparable period in the additional amortization expense was directly related to a full year of goodwill amortization relative to the acquisition of isi 
isi was acquired in june selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the comparable period in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to in  as compared with of net sales for the increase  in terms of absolute dollars  is primarily attributable to significant additions to the sales and marketing infrastructure within the company and higher facilities and personnel costs  partially offset by the shutdown of the company s ultrabeam operations 
the company presently anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses for the three month period ending march  will increase significantly  relative to the comparable period in  due primarily to higher anticipated sales  service and support expenses resulting from an anticipated increase in net sales and higher facilities and personnel costs 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  as compared with million recorded for as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in  primarily as a result of higher net sales and cost containment measures implemented in the second half of acquired in process research and development on june   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of integrated solutions  inc  a privately held manufacturer of i line and deep ultra violet reduction lithography systems 
as a result  the company recognized a charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d expense of million  or per share net of tax benefits  representing products in development stage that were not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
shutdown of operations during the quarter ended june   the company shut down the operations of its ultrabeam unit 
as a direct result of this decision  the company recognized a charge in the quarter ended june  of million  or per share diluted 
during the quarter ended september   the company recognized an additional charge of million  or per share diluted  primarily attributable to revised estimates of amounts to be realized upon the sale of operating assets 
of the year to date total charge of million  approximately million related to the disposition of operating and capital assets  million related to termination benefits associated with the termination of employees  million related to facilities and other non employee amounts paid for shutdown and 
million related to accrued liabilities still outstanding as of december  there were no significant revisions to the original termination provisions established by the company 
special charges due primarily to the continued downturn in the thin film head and semiconductor industries  the company recognized significantly lower sales and bookings levels during as a result  the company significantly reduced its production demand forecast for and implemented various cost containment measures beginning in the third quarter of during  the company recognized special charges in the amount of million for the write down of excess inventories and provisions for estimated losses on open purchase commitments 
these charges were included in cost of sales 
during  the company recognized charges in the amount of million related to collection uncertainty of certain accounts and leases receivable  provisions for sales returns and allowances and charges related to a reduction in the company s workforce and the consolidation of certain of its facilities 
these charges are included in operating expenses for gain on sale of land in september  the company exercised an option it held to purchase acres of undeveloped land it leased in san jose  california and sold this property to a third party 
this transaction resulted in a net gain of million  or per share diluted  before related income taxes 
in conjunction with this transaction  the company had collateralized a loan payable by the former owner to a third party with securities valued at million 
upon completion of this transaction  the restriction on these securities was removed 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  which consists primarily of interest income  was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for and million for income tax expense the company recognized income taxes of million during the year ended december   or per share diluted 
this provision for consists primarily of foreign withholding taxes  as well as state and federal minimum taxes 
there was no income tax benefit recognized in on the company s pre tax loss due to uncertainty related to the utilization of its net operating loss carry forward 
income taxes benefit represented of the loss before income taxes for the difference between the rate recognized and the statutory rate is primarily a result of not recognizing a benefit for the net operating loss carry forward and certain deferred tax asset reserves recognized during the company presently anticipates that it will recognize income tax expense in  primarily as a result of foreign income taxes and state and federal minimum taxes 
however  the company believes that the tax rate in will be substantially less than the statutory rate  primarily as a result of available federal net operating loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared with million provided by operating activities during cash flow generated by operating activities was primarily attributable to non cash charges to income of million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by the company s net loss for the year ended december   exclusive of the non operating gain on the sale of land  of million 
included in both the net loss and non cash charges to income for the year ended december  is an million charge the company took to operations  relating to the cumulative effect of the implementation of sab on prior year financial results 
the company sells certain of its accounts receivable in order to mitigate its credit risk and to enhance cash flow 
sales of accounts receivable typically precede final customer acceptance of the system 
among other terms and conditions  the agreements include provisions that require the company to repurchase receivables if certain conditions are present including  but not limited to  disputes with the customer regarding suitability of the product  and from time to time the company has repurchased certain accounts and leases receivable in accordance with these terms 
at december   million of sold accounts receivable were outstanding to third party financial institutions 
the company may continue to attempt to mitigate the impact of extended payment terms and non linear shipments by selling a substantial portion of its accounts receivable in the future 
there can be no assurance that this financing will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company believes that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of its systems  particularly newer products  the company s inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
in particular  the company is increasing its purchases of inventory  long term demonstration inventory  long term prepaid inventory and capital equipment for its saturn spectrum wafer stepper  verdant laser thermal processing system and its xls nm advanced reduction stepper 
higher inventory and capital asset levels may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence and asset impairment  which may adversely impact the company s results of operations 
in conjunction with its xls nm system  the company anticipates that it will be required to make advanced payments related to lens production of approximately million during the quarter ending march  the company intends to characterize this expenditure as a long term prepayment of inventories 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million and a net increase in available for sale securities of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of land of million and the release of restricted cash of million 
the capital expenditures were primarily attributable to the relocation of certain of the company s facilities and further expansion in san jose  california 
cash used in financing activities was million during the year ended december   primarily attributable to the company s previously announced stock buyback 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock for million 
the company has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of its common stock at prevailing market prices 
the company intends to finance the repurchase of its common stock from its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during the year ended december  the company raised million from stock issued pursuant to the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans and raised an additional million from borrowings under its existing line of credit pursuant to international hedging activities 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
the company s principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the development and manufacture of new lithography systems and enhancements are highly capital intensive 
in order to be competitive  the company must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  sales  service  training and support capabilities  investments in systems  procedures and controls  and expansion of operations and research and development  among many other items 
the company expects that anticipated cash flows from operations and its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address its working capital or capital equipment needs 
additionally  the company may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect any company profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event the company acquires product lines  technologies or businesses which do not complement the company s business  or which otherwise do not enhance the company s sales or operating results  the company may incur substantial write offs and higher recurring operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that any such acquisition does occur  there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on the company s business or operating results 
additionally  the company may experience renewed interest in its equipment leasing program and this may result in the further formation of significant long term receivables  which  in turn  would require the use of substantial amounts of working capital 
the formation of significant long term receivables and the granting of extended customer payment terms exposes the company to additional risks  including potentially higher customer concentration and higher potential operating expenses relating to customer defaults 
if reserves on lease receivables were required in the future  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
to the extent that the company s financial resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
adoption of the euro the introduction of a european single currency  the euro  was initially implemented as of january   and the transition period will continue through jan  as of december   the adoption of the euro has not had a material effect on the company s foreign exchange and hedging activities or the company s use of derivative instruments 
while the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction over time  based on currently available information  management does not believe that the introduction of the euro currency will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk due to potential changes in interest rates  relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december  the company maintains a strict investment policy  which is designed to ensure the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments are comprised of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted long term investments 
these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling techniques used measure the change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in interest rates 
assumed market value changes to the company s portfolio reflects immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps over a twelve month time horizon 
beginning fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest for financial reporting purposes at december  ending fair values comprise the estimated market principal plus accrued interest at a twelve month time horizon  and assumes no change in the investment principal or portfolio mix 
this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon no valuation of securities change given an interest rate in valuation of securities decrease interest given an interest rate increase of x basis points rate of x basis points short term investments  in thousands bps bps bps bps bps bps bps us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies        obligations of states and political subdivisions        us corporate debt us        total short term investments        the table was developed based on the fact that a bps move in the federal funds rate has occurred in eighteen times in the last ten years  a bps move in the federal funds rate has occurred in twelve times in the last ten years  and a bps move in the federal funds rate has occurred in six times in the last ten years 
the company has not materially altered its investment objectives or criteria and believes that  although the composition of the company s portfolio has changed from the preceding year  the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is materially the same 
credit risk the company mitigates default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
to date  the company has not experienced liquidity problems with its portfolio 
foreign exchange risk the company s operations in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally due to the limited scope of those operations and because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  the company s orders are often denominated in japanese yen 
this may subject the company to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure through the use of foreign exchange contracts 
the gains and losses on these contracts generated up to the point of shipment are deferred until such time as the revenue is recognized on the shipment 
gains and losses on these contracts generated after the point of shipment are recognized in current income 
at december  there were approximately million of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts
