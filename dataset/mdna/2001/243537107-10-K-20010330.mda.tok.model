the company currently expects sales and earnings to be down during the first half of versus the same period last year

cash provided by operating activities aggregated  for the year ended december  trade accounts receivable decreased since december   despite a increase in sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the decrease is due to the reduction in receivables from european retailers since december   as a result of the company s shift to selling only to distributors in late  whereas the company previously sold to a combination of distributors and retailers in inventories decreased since december  as a result of a decrease in canadian inventory with the closure of that warehouse as the company transitioned to using a distributor in that territory  a decrease in ugg inventory resulting from the increase in ugg shipments in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase in simple domestic inventories 
in addition  the decrease in both accounts receivable and inventories resulted from the company s continuing efforts to strengthen the balance sheet and maximize cash flows 
the company has a credit facility the facility which provides a maximum availability of  subject to a borrowing base of up to of eligible accounts receivables  as defined  and of eligible inventory  as defined 
up to  of borrowings may be in the form of letters of credit 
the facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december   or at the company s election at an adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
the facility is secured by substantially all assets of the company and expires january  the agreement underlying the facility includes a tangible net worth covenant  requiring the company to maintain tangible net worth  as defined  of  the company was in compliance with this covenant at december  at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and had outstanding letters of credit aggregating  the company had credit availability under the facility of  at december  under the terms of the facility  if the company terminates the arrangement prior to the expiration date of the facility  the company may be required to pay the lender an early termination fee ranging between and of the facility s commitment amount  depending upon when such termination occurs

the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program

in  the company received an option to buy teva and virtually all of its assets  including all worldwide rights to all teva products 
the company s original option was exercisable during the period from january  to december  or during the period from january  to december  on january   the company amended its option agreement  extending the first option window for two additional years 
as a result  the first option window is january  through december  the company agreed to pay mr 
thatcher million as consideration for this extension 
the option price is based on formulas tied to net sales of teva products and varies depending on when the option is exercised 
for the first option period  the option price is for an amount equal to the greater of i million or ii of the largest calendar year revenues since january  for the teva brand  plus million 
in addition  the company would issue to mr 
thatcher  shares of common stock and options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the purchase price for the second option period  january  to december   is equal to of the average of the aggregate net sales for all teva products for the two calendar years since january  with the highest aggregate net sales 
if the company does not exercise its option to acquire teva  the licensor has the option to acquire the teva distribution rights from the company for the period from january  to december   the end of the license term  and the option price is based on a formula tied to the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the exercise of either option will require a significant amount of additional financing 
there are no assurances that the additional financing will be available 
in the event that the company exercises its option to acquire the teva brand  the company would acquire virtually all assets including all teva patents  tradenames  trademarks and all other intellectual property 
the company currently has the worldwide license for teva footwear and pays the licensor a royalty ranging from to of net sales of teva products 
by acquiring teva  the company would eliminate the payment of royalties to the licensor 
in addition  the company would own the teva name and be able to pursue extension of the brand into other areas including apparel  outdoor gear and similar items  either through licensing to others or otherwise 
the company believes there are significant opportunities in this area given the strength of the teva brand in the outdoor market 
in conjunction with the company  the licensor has already developed licensing arrangements for teva apparel in the united states and japanese markets and is currently pursuing apparel licensees for additional territories 
by acquiring teva  the company would receive these existing royalty income streams  as well as any royalties from additional future licensees 
also  upon exercise of the option  the company would own the licensor s rapidly growing and profitable teva catalog and internet retailing business 
the company believes that by exercising its option to acquire teva  it will be able to significantly improve its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in  the company sold approximately million of teva products  paying a royalty of approximately million and incurring approximately million of additional costs that the company believes could have been eliminated had the company owned teva outright 
in addition  the licensor s catalog internet business yielded earnings before income taxes of approximately million in accordingly  had the company owned teva in  it would have been able to improve its ebitda by approximately million 
for  the first year following the end of the first option window  the company currently expects that its net sales of teva products will be in excess of million 
based on this sales level  the acquisition of teva would eliminate royalty expense of at least million and achieve other savings of approximately million 
in addition  the earnings before income taxes provided from the licensor s catalog internet business is expected to yield approximately million in and the royalty income from apparel licensees in the united states and japan alone  based on minimums in the existing apparel license agreements  would be approximately million 
as a result  the combined savings and additional operating income generated from the acquisition of teva would increase the company s ebitda by approximately million in the company continues to evaluate various alternatives for financing the potential acquisition of teva 
while no assurances can be given  the company believes it will be able to obtain the necessary financing 
given the wide range of financing possibilities  the ebitda amounts above for and do not consider the impact on interest expense resulting from the potential issuance of additional debt or any potential dilution impact on earnings per share resulting from any potential issuance of additional capital stock for the potential acquisition 
the amounts above also do not consider any increase in depreciation or amortization resulting from the acquisition 
the company believes that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under its existing credit facility  and the cash on hand will provide sufficient liquidity to enable it to meet its current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties which could impact the company s ability to maintain its cash position include the company s growth rate  its ability to collect its receivables in a timely manner  its ability to effectively manage its inventory  and the volume of letters of credit used to purchase product  among others 
seasonality financial results for the outdoor and footwear industries are generally seasonal 
sales of each of the company s different product lines have historically been higher in different seasons with the highest percentage of teva sales occurring in the first and second quarter of each year and the highest percentage of ugg sales occurring in the fourth quarter  while the quarter with the highest percentage of annual sales for simple has varied from year to year 
historically  the company s sales have been greater in the first and second quarters  teva s strong selling season  than in the third and fourth quarters 
however  given the company s current expectations for a decrease in teva sales for the first half of compared to combined with the anticipated continuing increase in ugg sales in the fall of  the company currently expects sales in the fourth quarter to equal or exceed the sales levels for the second quarter of the actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition  and the company s customers continuing to carry and promote its various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties
