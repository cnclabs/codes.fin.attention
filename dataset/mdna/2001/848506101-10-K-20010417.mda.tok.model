item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to such consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview in may  through our wholly owned subsidiary  petrini spa  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of pastificio gazzola spa the aggregate purchase price was approximately lire billion million in cash 
we agreed to make additional payments of up to lire billion approximately million to the sellers on may   subject to certain conditions 
however  petrini has contested the right of the former owners to receive the contingent payments aggregating lire billion million referenced above 
we have recently reached a verbal agreement to settle this dispute  together with amounts due to the former general manager under italian law as a result of the termination of his employment  for an amount not to exceed  although we anticipate that a written agreement incorporating these terms will be finalized in the next days  there can be no assurance that such agreement will be executed 
however  assuming such agreement is executed  our obligation to make the additional payments to the former owners of gazzola of up to lire billion million will be extinguished 
in december  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of petrini from gruppo spigadoro  nv as a result of the transaction  we changed our name from iat multimedia  inc to spigadoro  inc 
in consideration for the petrini shares  we o issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  of which  shares were issued  at gruppo spigadoro s request  to carlo petrini  our co chairman  to satisfy part of gruppo spigadoro s obligation to mr 
petrini  and o assumed approximately million of short term indebtedness of gruppo spigadoro  of which approximately million has been repaid to date 
during  we also sold our equity interests in fse computer handel gmbh co 
kg and fse computer handel verwaltung gmbh  a german company that markets high performance personal computers in germany  and closed down our remaining computer distribution company  columbus computer handel  and sold its assets 
see business restructuring and recent transactions 
as a result of these transactions  we changed the focus of our business from the sale of computers and computer components and peripherals to the production and sale of food products  including animal feed and pasta and flour products 
our animal feed business produces feed for industrial breeders  family owned breeding farms and domestic pets 
our pasta and flour business produces both branded and private label traditional  specialty and diet pastas and flours for the use of bakery industry 
as a result of the petrini transaction  we issued a controlling amount of our common stock to the stockholders of petrini and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
in a reverse acquisition  although we were the legal acquirer  petrini is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes 
therefore  the financial statements for all periods presented prior to the december  acquisition date are the financial statements of petrini 
for all periods subsequent to december   the financial statements are the financial statements of petrini and spigadoro 
as a result of our change in business strategy prior to the petrini transaction  we discontinued  for accounting purposes  all of our operations related to the distribution of personal computers and personal computer components  peripherals and software 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements of spigadoro 
our pasta and flour business and animal feed business represented approximately and approximately  respectively  of our revenues in virtually all of our sales of animal feed are in italy  while approximately of our pasta and flour products are exported to the united states  europe  southeast asia and other parts of the world 
since substantially all of our operations are currently in italy  our functional currency is the italian lire 
therefore  our financial statements are presented in lire for financial statement reporting 
all amounts stated in us dollars have been translated into us dollars for the convenience of the reader at the rate of lire  us  which approximates the noon buying rate of the federal reserve bank of new york on december  in the following discussions  most percentages and lire and us dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  general 
we acquired gazzola on may  and therefore our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal include the gazzola operations since such date  while our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal include only the operations of petrini 
as a result  i all revenue and expense accounts in the following discussion for fiscal were increased by the revenues and expenses incurred by gazzola since may  and ii the results include only a small amount of corporate overhead of spigadoro  inc as a result  year to year results are not necessarily comparable 
based upon the disappointing results of operations of gazzola during fiscal  petrini has recently taken several corrective measures 
first  we replaced the former owner and general manager with riccardo carelli  a former chief executive officer of barilla 
we have also implemented an efficiency plan that includes personnel reductions and the elimination of certain unprofitable contracts which is expected to result in a short term reduction in production volumes until such time  if ever  that higher margin contracts can be obtained 
in addition  as discussed above under overview  petrini has contested the right of the former owners of gazzola to receive certain contingent payments aggregating lire billion million  and we believe that we have reached a verbal agreement to settle this dispute  together with amounts due to mr 
gazzola under italian law as a result of the termination of his employment  for an amount not to exceed  net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million during fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of gazzola in may  which contributed lire billion million of additional sales to our pasta sector during the year 
consequently  net sales for pasta and flour for fiscal increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for fiscal net sales for animal feed for fiscal decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for fiscal on relatively flat volume 
the sales mix in animal feed was influenced by a number of factors during the year  including a dioxin plague which affected north italian chicken farmers and the arrival of mad cow disease bse in italy  which resulted in significant reductions in italian consumption of beef and milk 
consequently  our sales volumes of feed for milk cows and for chickens fell and  respectively  during fiscal however  we were able to partially offset these reductions through increased sales of feed for rabbits and sheep  as a result of various new marketing initiatives and changing consumer preferences in light of the well publicized beef and chicken health issues 
although we believe that our strategy of maintaining a presence in all major livestock branches and in all regions of italy may help to minimize the risks associated with these and other serious diseases impacting the food chain  there can be no assurance that such diseases will not have an adverse effect on our operations in the future 
see risk factors 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for fiscal  while the gross profit percentage fell to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to significant increases in the prices of certain key raw materials during specifically  the price of soya  which accounts for over of total raw material costs in animal feed  rose nearly during the year 
in the pasta sector  where semolina is the main ingredient and represents approximately of the cost of sales  average semolina costs increased approximately during in animal feed  we were able to secure certain compensating price increases  but did not fully regain our previous margin levels until the end of fiscal for example  while our average price of animal feed is currently approximately above average levels of  the average levels for fiscal were only above levels 
in pasta  strong competitive pressures in the private label sector have so far prevented gazzola from fully re establishing its previous margin levels and contributed to a reduction in gazzola s gross profit percentage from in fiscal to in fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses  including selling expenses and general and administrative expenses  relating to the petrini and gazzola operations stand alone in fiscal increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the acquisition of gazzola in may  which contributed lire billion million in additional operating expenses 
petrini s ongoing efficiency plan and related headcount reduction program resulted in an overall reduction of manpower from persons at the start of fiscal to persons at the end of the year  thereby creating lire billion million in ongoing  annualized personnel cost savings 
the positive impact of this cost reduction on the absolute level of operating expenses was  however  offset by approximately increases in the cost of energy in italy  which impacted production costs and lead to significant increases in distribution expenses  and the timing of the headcount reductions  with many of them occurring in the second half of the year 
in addition  fiscal includes certain non recurring severance costs incurred by petrini in connection with the personnel reductions and certain other one time charges  which in total represented lire billion million 
excluding these non recurring charges  operating expenses relating to the petrini and gazzola operations stand alone in fiscal would have been lire billion million 
consolidated operating expenses for fiscal increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for fiscal this increase was due to the additional effect of spigadoro corporate overhead costs  including a full year of goodwill amortization  whereas only two months of goodwill amortization were incurred in fiscal the headcount reductions and other efficiencies effected in have reduced our cost base and  together with certain price increases effected late in and into  are expected to positively impact gross profit and operating expenses during fiscal in addition  we anticipate certain headcount reductions at our gazzola operations during  which will further reduce our fixed costs 
see ebitda below 
income loss from operations 
loss from operations at petrini and gazzola stand alone amounted to lire billion million in fiscal compared to income from operations of lire billion million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in gross profit in fiscal resulting from the factors set forth above and an increase in operating expenses  in particular due to the gazzola acquisition and the disappointing results of operations at gazzola 
consolidated loss from operations for fiscal amounted to lire billion million compared to income from operations of lire billion million for fiscal due to the reasons discussed above and the additional effect of an increase in operating expenses as a result of spigadoro corporate overhead and the additional goodwill amortization expenses not incurred in fiscal interest expense 
net interest expense for fiscal increased by to lire billion million for fiscal from lire billion million in fiscal this increase was a result of additional debt incurred in connection with our acquisition of gazzola in may  interest expense relating to notes payable issued in the petrini acquisition in december a majority of which was repaid in and additional costs incurred relating to our increased factoring activity  together with an overall increase in prevailing bank interest rates in italy during fiscal other income 
other income increased to lire billion million in fiscal from other expense of lire million  in fiscal  primarily as a result of the sale of all of our algo vision shares resulting in a one time net gain of lire billion million and of exchange rate gains recognized upon the repayment of our lire billion promissory note issued in connection with our acquisition of petrini in december income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal was lire billion  compared to lire billion million in fiscal this decrease was attributable to a loss from continuing operations before income taxes at petrini and gazzola stand alone in fiscal of lire billion million compared to income from continuing operations of lire billion million in fiscal  offset primarily by the gain from the sale of the algo vision shares 
net income loss 
net loss for fiscal was lire billion million compared to net income of lire billion million in fiscal the loss was due to a reduction in gross profit  an increase in interest expense and operating expenses  including goodwill amortization  and an increase in income taxes  partially offset by the one time gain from the sale of all of our algo vision shares 
income taxes for fiscal increased to lire billion million from lire billion million for fiscal however  a substantial portion of the tax amount in fiscal is a non cash charge relating to the reversal of a deferred tax asset 
we will not be required to pay a substantial portion of the income taxes due on the sale of the algo vision shares as a result of the past net operating losses from our discontinued operations in switzerland 
ebitda 
ebitda relating to the petrini and gazzola operations stand alone in fiscal decreased by to negative lire billion million from positive lire billion million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in gross profit in as a result of an increase in raw material and energy costs  a sales mix favoring lower margin products  as well as an increase in operating expenses relating to our gazzola acquisition and non recurring severance payments in connection with headcount reductions pursuant to petrini s efficiency plan 
excluding non recurring charges related to the severance payments and other extraordinary costs described above of an aggregate of lire billion million  ebitda relating to the petrini and gazzola operations stand alone during fiscal would have been lire billion 
consolidated ebitda for fiscal  which does not include the lire billion million gain received from the sale of our algo vision shares  decreased by to negative lire billion million from positive billion million in fiscal due to the factors discussed above and to the additional effect of corporate overhead expenses not incurred in fiscal the non recurring severance payments discussed above  which aggregate lire billion million  relate to net headcount reductions of positions  which we anticipate will create lire billion million in ongoing  annualized personnel cost savings and which will positively impact gross profit and operating expenses  as well as ebitda  beginning in we anticipate that further reductions of personnel at our gazzola operations will continue in  which will further decrease our ongoing cost base but will create additional one time severance charges 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to income from operations  net income  cash flow or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in sales prices to our customers resulting from a decrease in raw material costs  partially offset by a slight increase in total sales volume to  tons in from  tons in net sales for animal feed for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december   while the sales volume was unchanged at approximately  tons for the years ended december  and net sales for pasta and flour for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  despite an increase of in sale volumes resulting from new marketing campaigns 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit resulted in an increase in the gross margin percentage to in from in this increase was primarily due to a decrease in raw material prices which contributed to an increase in gross profit and was also due to increased production efficiencies 
gross profit in the year ended december  was impacted by a loss of approximately lire billion  due to costs related to the discontinuation of a pig breeding farm during the last quarter of operating expenses 
operating expenses  including selling costs and general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million  or of net sales  from lire billion million for the year ended december   or of net sales 
this increase was primarily due to a non recurring cost associated with the introduction of an efficiency plan  including management consulting and professional services as well as overhead costs of approximately lire billion  relating to petrini foods international inc which were not incurred during income from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit as a result of improved production efficiencies  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  the significant decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates in italy  improvements in our lending margins and a reduction in our average outstanding indebtedness 
income before taxes 
income before taxes for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in income from operations and a significant reduction in net interest expense caused primarly by a reduction in italian interest rates during and a reduction in our outstanding indebtedness 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million from lire billion  for the year ended december  income taxes for the year ended december  increased to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit  and a decrease in interest expense during  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses during ebitda 
ebitda for the year ended december  increased by to lire billion million from lire billion million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased gross margins as a result of increased production efficiencies and a reduction in raw material prices partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
ebitda in the year ended december  was impacted by non recurring operating expenses of approximately lire billion  and the losses incurred by petrini foods international 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to income from operations  net income  cash flow or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents increased to lire billion million from lire billion million at december  working capital at december  was negative lire billion million compared to negative working capital of lire billion million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was lire billion million during fiscal compared to lire billion million during fiscal this reduction was primarily due to the net loss arising in fiscal  offset by an increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal amounted to lire billion million  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of lire billion million in fiscal the principle uses were the acquisition of gazzola for a net amount of lire billion million  and purchases of plant and equipment for production purposes for an amount of lire billion million  partially offset by the proceeds on the sale of the algo vision securities 
net cash used in financing activities was lire billion  during fiscal compared to lire billion million in fiscal the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a lire billion syndicated credit facility signed with a banking consortium lead by monte di paschi di siena  offset by the repayment of lire billion million of promissory notes issued in connection with the petrini acquisition in december and the repayment of lire billion million of long term debt 
at december  our total indebtedness increased to lire billion million compared to lire billion million at december   primarily due to debt assumed at our acquired gazzola operation and debt incurred to pay for the gazzola acquisition 
at december  we had short term debt in the aggregate amount of lire billion million comprised of borrowings under short term credit facilities  indebtedness assumed in the acquisition of petrini and lire billion million of a syndicated credit facility drawn down in connection with the gazzola acquisition which matures in october we maintain unsecured short term credit facilities with over italian banks 
these facilities are typically available for terms up to one year and accrue interest at rates that fluctuate relative to the official italian rate of discount 
at december   the aggregate amount outstanding under these short term credit facilities was lire billion million  and lire billion million was unused and available for borrowing 
borrowings under these facilities are used to support our italian operations and are serviced by cash flow from operations 
at december   all of the promissory notes issued in the acquisition of petrini had been repaid except for a portion of a million promissory note payable to gruppo spigadoro nv  the principal stockholder of the company 
at december   lire billion million remained outstanding under such note including accrued interest 
the gruppo spigadoro note was originally scheduled to mature on december   but the remaining amount outstanding under such note was converted into a demand promissory note 
as noted above  the lire billion million working capital facility secured in april will mature in october as of march   we have drawn down lire billion million of this facility  and lire billion million remains available 
we will be required to refinance such facility prior to its maturity 
while we anticipate that we will be able to refinance this facility on terms acceptable to us  we currently have no agreements or arrangements to do so  and our inability to secure such financing would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
at december  we had long term debt including current portion in the aggregate amount of lire billion million 
the debt matures over varying terms through and accrues interest either at fixed annual interest rates ranging from to or variable rates based upon various interest rate measures 
substantially all of the long term debt is secured by liens on petrini and gazzola s property 
a portion of the long term debt is subsidized by government agencies 
we continue to expand our factoring arrangements whereby we sell a portion of our accounts receivable without recourse 
a portion of the proceeds of this arrangement have been used to pay short term indebtedness while the remaining proceeds have been used for working capital 
at december  the aggregate amount of factoring outstanding was lire billion million 
we believe our factoring program improves our cash and short term debt positions  and the failure to maintain any such factoring arrangements could adversely impact our liquidity 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of spigadoro 
in a series of transactions commencing in february  we sold all of our  shares of algo vision plc for approximately million of gross proceeds 
we believe that our funds  including cash expected to be generated from operations  together with amounts available under our credit facilities and factoring arrangements  should be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and our capital and debt service requirements for the month period following december   depending upon acquisitions 
we may require additional funds for acquisitions and the integration and management of acquired businesses  and we anticipate undertaking an appropriate refinancing of the lire billion syndicated debt facility on or before the maturity of this facility in october in addition  we believe that our current allocation between long term debt and short term debt is not optimized  and we intend to refinance a portion of our indebtedness in an effort to allocate a greater portion of out total debt to long term debt 
we have no present commitments or arrangements to obtain any additional funds and we cannot predict whether additional funds will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we cannot obtain funds when required  the growth of our business may be adversely affected
