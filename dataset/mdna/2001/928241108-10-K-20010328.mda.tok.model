we do not intend to update our forward looking statements to reflect future events or developments 
since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and product development programs 
viropharma has generated no revenues from product sales and has been dependent upon funding primarily from equity and debt financing 
we do not expect any revenues from product sales for at least the next twelve months 
we have not been profitable since inception and have incurred a cumulative net loss of  through december  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
we expect such losses to increase over historical levels  primarily due to expected increases in our research and development expenses  and further clinical trials of our most advanced drug candidate  picovir tm 
also  we expect to incur expenses related to our marketing and market research activities for picovir tm  our development of a marketing and sales staff and further research and development related to our hepatitis c and respiratory syncytial virus rsv disease product candidates 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on developing and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  successfully commercializing such product candidates which may include entering into collaborative agreements for product development and commercialization  and securing contract manufacturing services and distribution and logistics services 
liquidity and capital resources we commenced operations in december we are a development stage company and to date have not generated revenues from product sales 
the cash flows used in operations are primarily for research and development activities and the supporting general and administrative expenses 
through december   we have used approximately million in operating activities 
we invest our cash in short term investments 
through december   we have used approximately million in investing activities  including million in short term investments and million in equipment purchases and new construction 
through december   we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of common stock  a convertible subordinated notes offering  private placements of redeemable preferred stock  two bank loans  equipment lease lines and a milestone advance totaling approximately million 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating approximately million 
we lease our corporate and research and development facilities under an operating lease expiring in we also have the right  under certain circumstances  to purchase the facility 
we have exercised our right to expand our current facility by  square feet 
we expect to incur an estimated million of capital expenditures in connection with this expansion 
we expect that we will incur these expenses in the second half of in addition  we expect that rent expense in future years will increase approximately  per year  commencing in early we have financed substantially all of our equipment under two bank loans and two master lease agreements 
the first bank loan  which we entered into in february  is for  is payable in equal monthly installments over months and has a interest rate 
the second bank loan  which we entered into in december  is for  is payable in equal monthly installments over months and has a interest rate 
in addition  we paid off a million loan to boehringer ingelheim in august we also have paid off both of the lease agreements 
as of march   aggregate outstanding borrowings under these bank loans were approximately  we amended and restated our agreement with sanofi synthelabo in february under this agreement  we are required to make royalty payments on any sales in the united states and canada of products developed under the agreement  which royalty payments will be reduced upon the expiration of the last patent on picovir tm or any related drug 
we currently are negotiating commercial supply agreements for picovir tm with drug substance and final product manufacturers and with drug micronizers  and we expect that we may pay up to approximately  during under these arrangements 
we have incurred losses from operations since inception 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
we expect to incur such losses at an increasing rate over at least the next several years primarily due to expected increases in our research and development expenses  and further clinical trials and clinical development of our most advanced product candidate  picovir tm 
we expect to increase spending over historical levels during as we conduct additional clinical trials and supporting studies for the potential expansion of the use of picovir tm 
also  we expect to incur significant expenses for picovir tm marketing and market research activities  our development of a marketing and sales staff and building the requisite infrastructure 
in addition  we anticipate that our investments in further research and development related to our hepatitis c and rsv disease product candidates will increase over historical levels 
we expect to increase spending over historical levels for at least the next six months for our hepatitis c and rsv disease product candidates in connection with an anticipated exploratory clinical trial with vp for the treatment of hepatitis c and the safety studies with vp for the treatment of rsv disease 
we expect our spending in the general and administrative areas to increase modestly during we expect that we will need to raise additional funds to continue our business activities  fund debt service and to further expand our facilities 
we have convertible notes payable in the amount of  these notes bear interest at per annum and become due in march we may need additional financing to complete all clinical studies  to develop our marketing and sales staffs for picovir tm and to build the requisite infrastructure 
we expect that we will need additional financing for the development and required testing of our hepatitis c and rsv disease compounds  and for any other product candidates 
to obtain this financing  we intend to access the public or private equity or debt markets or enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue shares of our stock 
for example  in connection with our collaboration and license agreement  american home products corporation will purchase our common stock at a market value premium at the time of completion of certain product development stages 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
collaborative arrangements may require us to grant product development programs or licenses to third parties for products that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
additional financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current research and development programs or other aspects of our business

also  in connection with our agreement with american home products for hepatitis c  we are due  for research and development expenses incurred by us on behalf of the collaboration which has been recorded with a corresponding reduction to our research and development expenses for the year ended december  the amount due is arrived at using the contractual percentages and amounts for cost sharing and certain activities 
general and administrative expenses were  in the year ended december  compared to  for the same period of the increase was principally due to an increase in employee related expenses  pre marketing expenses related to picovir tm and business development related activities 
interest expense and interest income increased substantially in the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increases are due to the investing of proceeds from the issuance of million convertible subordinated debentures issued in march of which pay interest per annum

in  picovir tm was being studied in three phase clinical trials  two in viral meningitis and one in viral respiratory infection 
this compares to in which the company was conducting phase clinical trials with picovir tm for both viral meningitis and viral respiratory infection  with fewer patients enrolled in these studies compared to the phase clinical studies 
the increase in was also the result of the advancement of drug candidates for the treatment of hepatitis c hcv and respiratory syncytial virus rsv diseases 
we recorded  as a reduction to research and development expenses in the year ended december  for an adjustment to a milestone payable to sanofi synthelabo and the reimbursement that we received from sanofi synthelabo for a license fee that we had previously paid to them 
such amounts were originally recorded as research and development expenses in prior periods 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period of the increase in is the result of market research and medical education programs for picovir tm and additional employee related expenses
