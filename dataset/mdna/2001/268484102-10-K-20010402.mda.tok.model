the revolving line of credit also places restrictions on liens  investments  changes of control and other matters and is secured by an interest in substantially all of our assets

seasonality historically  our operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the first quarter  ending march  has traditionally been the weakest  and the third quarter  ending september  has traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors  including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of our terminal network 
we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and net income are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through operational actions 
we provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  operate with many functional currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  asia  the south pacific and europe 
this diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the effect of potential changes in the value of our local currency denominated revenues and expenses 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through the use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles the majority of intercompany obligations two times per month 
as of december   we had million outstanding under a line of credit 
our lease payments on certain financed facilities are tied to market interest rates 
at december   a rise in the base rate for these financing arrangements would not have a material impact on operating income in we have not purchased any material futures contracts nor have we purchased or held any material derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during in the second quarter of  we entered into contracts for the purpose of hedging the costs of a portion of anticipated jet fuel purchases for chartered aircraft during the following twelve months 
these contracts mature in the second quarter of such contracts are nominally insignificant 
exchange rate sensitivity the following tables provide comparable information about our non functional currency components of balance sheet items by currency  and presents such information in us dollar equivalents at december  and these tables summarize information on transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates is then subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency
