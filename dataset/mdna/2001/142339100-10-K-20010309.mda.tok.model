item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
carlisle companies incorporated reported sales of billion in  up  or million  from sales of billion 
acquisitions were the primary contributor to the year over year sales increase 
sales volume at many carlisle companies was affected by the reduction in customer demand in the fourth quarter 
in  sales increased or million  as a result of internal growth  driven by product line expansion and market share gains  as well as the effect of acquisitions completed in and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in net earnings in were million  or per share  compared to net earnings of million  or per share 
as the fourth quarter unfolded  the rapid economic slowdown  seen throughout the manufacturing community  was reflected in the sales and operating earnings of many carlisle companies 
margin pressures caused by competitive pricing and increased material costs also affected earnings 
net earnings in increased  due to increased sales levels coupled with operational improvements made throughout the company 
the disappointing fourth quarter  caused by steep declines in demand  diluted improvements made at many carlisle companies throughout the year 
what started as a very promising year  with demand in excess of capacity at some facilities  took a drastic turn in the fourth quarter 
a downturn in many original equipment markets occurred without a corresponding increase in the aftermarket  events that normally do not coincide 
market prices dropped as competitors fought to retain volume in declining markets 
this  coupled with upward pressure on costs  brought margins down 
yet  with few exceptions  carlisle s companies maintained competitively strong leadership positions in each of their major markets 
to further sharpen carlisle s competitive capability  management has taken action to increase efficiency and reduce costs by announcing the closure of two plants  six regional support offices and other staff reductions 
the expense associated with these actions resulted in a pretax charge to operations of million in the fourth quarter 
it is expected that this charge will result in a benefit in equivalent to the charge 
approximately of this year s sales growth came from acquisitions completed in and the full year impact of acquisitions 
during  carlisle completed a record ten acquisitions and established three joint ventures 
these acquisitions were dynair  inc  a canadian manufacturer of duct supplies  tuchenhagen damrow  llc and kolding gruppen a s  global equipment suppliers to the cheese industry  dura ware co

operating segments construction materials segment sales of million in were flat over sales of million 
the relatively soft commercial roofing market experienced in  as compared to  stunted sales growth in this segment 
although sales of thermoplastic polyolefin tpo membrane and insulation increased year over year  a soft domestic roofing market  further slowed by the cold  wet weather experienced in the fourth quarter of  coupled with a change in product mix  reduced sales 
carlisle coatings waterproofing experienced higher sales driven by its adhesive tape and sealant products 
in  segment sales increased from sales of million as a result of the expansion of its insulation and tpo products 
segment earnings were down slightly in to million  from million in the continuing trend of raw material price increases  the inability to pass those increases on to our customers  as well as the change in product mix  negatively impacted earnings this year  despite the continuing trend of favorable warranty claims experience 
in segment earnings were up over earnings of million  reflecting increased sales levels  improved operational performance and favorable warranty experience 
the improvement in earnings was partially offset by the absorption of increased raw material costs and changes in product mix 
industrial components segment sales of million for surpassed sales of million by 
two acquisitions completed during the year by carlisle tire wheel and tensolite fueled much of this segment s sales growth 
tensolite s diversification into cable assembly and high performance interconnects has brought this company into the forefront of the communications technology market and has helped to expand its customer base and markets served 
carlisle tire wheel s acquisition of the consumer tire and wheel division of titan international has increased its sales through further expansion of its product line and customer base 
the company s off highway and industrial brake and friction businesses saw a sales improvement in  primarily in the industrial aftermarket product lines 
in  segment sales increased over sales of million 
this increase was due to growth of new customers and new products in the specialty tire and wheel business of carlisle tire wheel  but was dampened by lower demand for aerospace bulk cable  heavy duty friction to the aftermarket and off highway industrial brakes 
segment earnings increased to million over earnings of million 
earnings improvements at carlisle tire wheel driven by the cragar and titan acquisitions were reduced by the impact of higher material and utility costs  coupled with expansion and integration costs 
carlisle industrial brake friction had a positive comparison to resulting from the successful implementation of productivity improvements and cost reduction programs 
tensolite s cable assembly operations also made a positive contribution to this segment s earnings in tensolite has consolidated and upgraded its cable assembly operations in order to strengthen its manufacturing capabilities and flexibility as it prepares for future growth 
motion control  the off highway business  was impacted by lower demand compounded by competitive pricing and higher material costs 
segment earnings increased in from million in factors leading to the increase were product line extension and operational improvements at carlisle tire wheel 
offsetting these improvements were lower earnings at tensolite and carlisle industrial brake friction due to less robust markets 
automotive components segment sales for automotive components were down in to million  from million in this segment experienced an overall reduction in production build rates throughout coming off s record pace  with heavier reductions noted in the fourth quarter of this year 
in  segment sales were up over sales of million  as a result of a very strong automotive and light truck market 
segment earnings of million were slightly above segment earnings of million 
earnings in this segment were up through september th  as a result of operational improvements and efficiencies gained 
however  the reduction in industry demand in the fourth quarter and the corresponding impact on sales offset the improvement made throughout the year 
earnings in increased due to the release of production backlog following the resolution of the gm strike in as well as improved product mix 
return on assets and free cash flow both improved significantly in this segment 
general industry all other the general industry segment sales of million exceeded sales by 
acquisitions completed at each of the businesses in this segment during the year were principally responsible for the segment s sales growth 
carlisle systems equipment expanded its reach of isolation systems for the pharmaceutical industry and cheese processing equipment for the dairy products industry and has become a leader in these respective niches 
the sales gains at carlisle transportation products  due to the acquisition of red river and increased demand at the tank trailer business  were more than offset by the decline in demand at the trail king specialty trailer operations 
this decline was caused by the ongoing softness in the transportation markets as a result of rising fuel costs 
acquisitions completed during the year at carlisle foodservice offset lower sales of the core foodservice business 
segment sales of million in were flat with sales of million 
on a pro forma basis  excluding the effect of the perishable cargo divestiture in january  sales increased over sales and earnings at carlisle systems equipment account for much of this pro forma increase  due to the acquisition of johnson truck bodies as well as internal growth 
carlisle transportation products sales were up over primarily due to a strong highway construction market 
higher sales were recorded in our foodservice business due to product line expansions in both international and domestic markets 
segment earnings of million were down over margin pressures at carlisle foodservice and sales declines at carlisle transportation products and systems equipment s johnson truck bodies  offset the earnings increases from the acquisitions in the other carlisle systems equipment businesses 
carlisle foodservice struggled throughout the second half of the year to fight off increased raw material and freight costs 
price increases were implemented late in and should improve margins in  but could not offset the cost increases already absorbed this year 
earnings at carlisle transportation products specialty trailer operations were negatively impacted by lower productivity as a result of the sales decline in each of its markets 
rising fuel costs reduced demand for new equipment particularly in the commercial trailer markets 
segment earnings of million in increased over segment earnings of million 
pro forma earnings grew  after excluding the perishable cargo business  which was divested in january of  reflecting primarily the increase in sales in this segment 
financial results gross margin  expressed as a percent of sales  represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold 
these margins increased from in  to in  but declined to in in  improved operational efficiency  as well as improved product mix  accounted for the higher margin rate 
the decline from to reflects the competitive marketplace  higher raw material prices coupled with the reduced demand during the fourth quarter of this year 
selling and administrative costs  expressed as a percent of sales  of in  in  and in  reflect the continued emphasis on cost control throughout all operations and lower cost structures in carlisle s overall businesses 
total costs  which include raw material  manufacturing  selling  general and administrative  and research and development costs expressed as a percentage of total sales  have remained fairly consistent  at in  in and in through the third quarter of  total costs  as a percentage of sales were  a 
point improvement over the same period of the increase in total costs in was driven by raw material price increases  compounded by declining market demand in the fourth quarter 
the improvement in the total cost relationship in was due to improved operating efficiencies 
interest expense  net increased to million in from million in  due to higher debt levels throughout the year  as a result of the completion of a record number of acquisitions  during the year 
strong internally generated cash flows financed planned capital expenditures and some of the acquisition spending 
income taxes  for financial reporting purposes  decreased in to an effective tax rate of compared to in  and in the successful implementation of various foreign and state tax strategies was responsible for much of this improvement 
receivables  of million reflect a decrease over the level of million 
the sales decline experienced in the fourth quarter  as well as a focus on reducing days sales outstanding  was responsible for the improvement 
the level of receivables represented a increase over levels and was in line with the sales growth for that year 
inventories  valued primarily by the last in  first out lifo method  were million at year end  a increase over the year end level of million 
the increase in inventory at year end was primarily due to higher inventory at carlisle tire wheel in preparation for the spring selling season  and at carlisle foodservice as a result of acquisitions made during the current year 
in  the increase in inventory over was also due to seasonal demands and the impact of acquisitions 
capital expenditures totaled million in  up from million in investments were made in production capacity in china and trinidad for tire and wheel assemblies  as well as plant and equipment to manufacture tpo roofing membranes  specialty trailers and processing equipment 
liquidity  capital resources and environmental cash flows provided by operating activities were million in compared to million in the decrease is due to higher working capital at the end of partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization 
cash used in investing activities was million versus million in  an increase of million 
this increase was attributable to the unprecedented level of acquisition spending during the year of million versus million in in addition  in  cash used in investing activities was offset by the proceeds  net of tax  from the divestiture of the perishable cargo business 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was million versus a use of cash of million in in  short term borrowings were used to finance acquisitions made during the year 
the net cash used in financing activities in reflects the repayment of short term borrowings 
in june of  carlisle replaced its million revolving credit facility with new million credit facilities 
these facilities are available for investments in acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital are cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity 
carlisle continues to maintain substantial flexibility to meet anticipated needs for liquidity and investment opportunities 
carlisle management recognizes the importance of the company s responsibilities toward matters of environmental concern 
programs are in place to monitor and test facilities and surrounding environments and  where practical  to recycle materials 
carlisle has not incurred material charges relating to environmental matters in or in prior years  and none are currently anticipated 
backlog and future outlook backlog was million at december  compared to million in higher backlog at carlisle tire wheel  tensolite and carlisle systems equipment reflect the strong market penetration achieved by these businesses through internal efforts and the acquisition of key market niches 
automotive components backlog was down from december levels due to the decline in demand in the fourth quarter  and the anticipated slowing of the automotive build rates  particularly in the first quarter of with the onset of management is pleased to announce three recently completed acquisitions by carlisle process systems bontech engineering a s  in denmark  scheffers  division of siersema bv and stork friesland bv  both in the netherlands 
each of these companies strengthen carlisle s position in evaporation and drying systems for the food and dairy processing industries 
additionally  carlisle syntec has announced a letter of intent to acquire ecostar  inc  a manufacturer of synthetic roofing tiles for the residential and commercial steep slope roofing markets 
there is opportunity in this changed economic environment 
the companies we have acquired in and those announced in  bring new products  customers and markets to carlisle s portfolio 
although we believe the first half of the year will be a challenge  our competitive position is strong and we are optimistic about the opportunities for growth and leadership in our markets 
we have made strides toward achieving our objective of increased global presence in industries that are attractive to us 
our longstanding operating principles of targeted market leadership  growth from within  lean organizational structure  low cost  decentralized operations  and strategic acquisitions to achieve our sales and earnings growth objectives  have enabled us to show positive results year over year despite the market conditions we face 
as we move into  we are confident that these principles will continue to result in operating success for carlisle
