results of operations revenues 
the following table displays revenues from contracts with our base non gm clients and revenues from contracts with gm dollars in millions revenues base    gm    total    total revenues increased in to billion  up from billion in  which represented a increase over total revenues of billion 
base revenues grew in to billion  compared with an increase to billion in the increase in base revenues in resulted primarily from new contract signings  as well as from full year revenues attributable to systemhouse  which was acquired in april approximately one half of the increase in base revenues in resulted from new contract signings  while the other half of the increase was attributable to systemhouse 
these increases in base revenues in and were partially offset by decreases resulting from the divestiture during of certain business units and the discontinuation of certain contracts to align service offerings with our four global lines of business to capture synergies and further leverage our delivery platforms 
see restructuring and other charges below 
base revenues in included a negative adjustment of million primarily as a result of a legal dispute with a client 
the negative impact of this adjustment was partially offset by a gain of million recorded as revenue resulting from the sale of a portion of our leasing portfolio 
revenues from gm declined in to billion  compared with a decline in approximately two thirds of the decrease in revenues from contracts with gm in was due to the renegotiation of our sector agreements with gm covering its north american operations and gmac  which became effective january  the remainder of the decline was due primarily to foreign currency fluctuations 
the decline in revenues from gm in  when compared to  was primarily the result of billing rate reductions for certain existing services provided to gm  partially offset by new contracts with gm for additional products and services 
we anticipate that revenues from contracts with gm in will remain at approximately the level 
revenues from both base and gm clients were negatively impacted in by foreign currency fluctuations  due primarily to the relative decline of both the euro and the british pound against the us dollar 
on a constant foreign currency basis  total revenues for increased over  resulting from an increase of in revenues from base clients and a decline of in revenues from gm 
other than gm  no one client accounted for more than of our total revenues in  or effective january   we reorganized our business on a global basis along the following four lines of business information solutions  business process management  e 
solutions and at kearney 
information solutions encompasses traditional it outsourcing including network and system operations  data management  applications development and field services  as well as internet hosting and web site management 
business process management is the outsourcing of one or more business processes or functions to improve overall business performance

at kearney provides high value management consulting services including strategy  e business services  strategic information technology  organization and operations consulting  as well as executive search services 
our e 
solutions and at kearney lines of business constitute our consulting reportable segment 
prior to the reorganization  we disclosed segment information by aggregating client contracts along the following three lines of business systems and technology services  business process management and management consulting 
in the following discussion  segment revenues for prior periods have been restated to reflect the new reporting structure 
because certain financial information for is not readily available under the new reporting structure  amounts for revenues by reportable segments for have been estimated based on the information reported for the following table displays the percentage of revenues by reportable segments for the years ended december   and revenues of non us operations are measured using fixed currency exchange rates with differences between fixed and actual exchange rates being included in the all other category 
in addition  the all other category includes revenues from our unigraphics solutions inc subsidiary 
revenues from contracts with gm are reported in each of our reportable segments  predominantly in information solutions

our gross margin percentage 
revenues less cost of revenues revenues 
increased to in  compared with in and in the increase in our gross margin percentage in is primarily the result of the cost saving initiatives we implemented during see restructuring and other charges below 
the increase in total gross margin in resulting from these initiatives was partially offset by a decrease in the gross margin on contracts with gm resulting primarily from the renegotiation of our sector agreements with gm covering its north american operations and gmac  which became effective january  the increase in gross margin during  as compared with  was due to the cost savings initiatives implemented in  as well as to negative adjustments recorded to revenues in see revenues above 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues in is primarily the result of the initiatives we implemented in designed to improve operating margins 
cost savings realized from these initiatives were partially offset by increased spending for marketing and branding  web enabled employee training and development  improvements to certain of our internal systems  and other areas of strategic importance 
sg a expenses in included the recognition of million related to the retirements of the former chairman and vice chairman 
in addition  we incurred incremental sg a expenses during related to the improvement of certain of our internal systems  the implementation of the sap enterprise resource process system  increased spending on employee development and a management retention plan 
restructuring and other charges 
the following table summarizes restructuring and other charges for the years ended december   and in millions restructuring activity  reversal of prior restructuring accruals 
in process research and development other charges total restructuring and other charges  in the first quarter of  we began the implementation of initiatives designed to reduce costs  streamline our organizational structure and exit certain operating activities 
as a result of these initiatives  we recorded restructuring charges and related asset write downs totaling  million for the year ended december  amounts recorded for restructuring activities during provide for planned workforce reductions of approximately  employees  consisting of approximately  employees who accepted the company s early retirement offer and the involuntary termination of approximately  individuals employed throughout the company in managerial  professional  clerical  consulting and technical positions 
total involuntary termination and early retirement offer charges amounted to million  million of which pertains to the expense associated with special termination benefits related to the early retirement offers net of a curtailment gain  including amounts under the company s defined benefit pension plan  and million from changes to the vesting conditions for unvested restricted stock units and options 
in addition  these initiatives resulted in the exit of certain business activities  the consolidation of facilities and the write down of certain assets to fair value 
charges associated with these actions include million related to business exit and facilities consolidation costs  and asset write downs of million 
the accrual for business exit activities and consolidation of facilities includes estimated costs of million to terminate software license agreements  million to terminate certain leases  million to terminate certain client contracts and million for other costs 
these costs are associated with the exit of certain operations  primarily within our information solutions line of business 
asset write downs related to the restructuring activities consist of million to write off software  goodwill and other intangibles  and million for write downs of computer related equipment and other assets 
such asset write downs predominantly related to businesses we have decided to exit in each of our lines of business and were primarily determined based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
during the year ended december   we reversed restructuring accruals totaling million  million of which was attributable to the initiatives begun in the first quarter of  and the remainder of which was attributable to the and restructuring initiatives as discussed below 
as a result of our ongoing evaluation of the results to date of the initiatives begun in  we amended some of the original restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of due to actual attrition rates for job categories and or geographies differing from original expectations 
these amendments consist primarily of plans to involuntarily terminate employees different from those originally planned 
due to the specific requirements to detail both the type of position and location of the workplace when recording a restructuring charge  these amendments resulted in the reversal of a portion of the charge associated with the original plan  representing approximately  of the original positions  and the recognition of a charge associated with the new plan 
as a result of the new plan  we recorded restructuring charges and asset write downs totaling million in the fourth quarter of the financial impact of the new plan was more than offset by the reversal of accruals of million related to restructuring charges previously recorded in  resulting in a net reversal of restructuring charges of million for amounts recorded for restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of provide for workforce reductions of approximately  employees  consisting of individuals employed throughout the company in managerial  professional  clerical  consulting and technical positions 
total involuntary termination charges amounted to million  million of which pertains to changes in the vesting conditions for unvested restricted stock units and options 
these initiatives also resulted in charges of million resulting from the exit of certain business activities and the consolidation of facilities  and asset write downs of million 
the accrual for business exit activities and consolidation of facilities includes estimated costs of million to exit certain leases  million to terminate certain client contracts and million for other costs 
these costs are associated primarily with our business process management line of business 
asset write downs related to the restructuring activities consist primarily of write downs of computer related equipment and other assets 
such asset write downs  which predominantly related to businesses that we have decided to exit in the information solutions line of business  were primarily determined based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
through december   approximately  employees had left the company through involuntary termination as a result of the and initiatives  and approximately million of termination benefits have been charged to the accrual 
in addition  approximately million has been paid in connection with the exit activities described above 
we expect that remaining cash expenditures relating to these charges will be incurred primarily in restructuring actions contemplated under the and restructuring plans are essentially complete as of december   with remaining reserves of million comprised primarily of future severance related payments to terminated employees  future lease payments for exited facilities and accruals for other restructuring activities 
through december   these restructuring activities have resulted in approximately  employees involuntarily terminated and approximately  employees accepting early retirement offers 
the restructuring activities have resulted in cash expenditures of million since the second quarter of during the years ended december  and  we reversed restructuring accruals related to these initiatives of million and million  respectively 
during  we recorded asset write downs of million primarily relating to operating assets initially identified for sale in as of december   all such assets had been sold 
acquisition of engineering animation  inc on october   one of our subsidiaries  unigraphics solutions inc  or ugs  acquired all of the outstanding stock of engineering animation  inc  or eai  for a purchase price of million  net of cash acquired  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
eai is a leader in internet enabled visual process management  collaboration  analysis and communication solutions for extended manufacturing enterprises 
the cost of eai was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to in process research and development r d in the amount of million  were expensed upon acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price  including fees and expenses related to the acquisition  over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired and in process r d was million and is being amortized over periods of three to seven years 
in process r d relates to the value of technology under development at the time of acquisition 
the value assigned to in process r d was determined based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of the underlying development efforts  resulting net cash flows and the discounting of such cash flows to their present value using average risk adjusted rates and a percent complete factor 
the in process r d will have no alternative future use if the products under development are not feasible 
efforts to complete development products continue  and there are no known delays to company forecasted plans 
acquisition of solid edge 
on march   ugs completed the acquisition of intergraph corporation s mechanical cad cam business for a purchase price of million  excluding million of acquisition costs 
in connection with the allocation of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets  ugs allocated million to in process r d that was expensed upon acquisition 
the in process r d related to the modification of solid edge version software to include ugs parasolid solid modeling kernel software 
the value assigned to in process r d was determined based on estimates of the resulting net cash flows from solid edge and the discounting of such cash flows to present value using average risk adjusted rates and a percent complete factor 
management continues to believe that the original net cash flow projections for solid edge are reasonable 
other income expense 
the components of other income expense are presented below for the years ended december   and in millions interest and other income interest expense gain on sale of stock of subsidiary total interest and other income decreased million in to million due primarily to the recognition of incremental gains in resulting from the disposition of certain investments 
in and we recorded pre tax gains of million and million  respectively  on the disposition of certain investments 
interest expense increased million in to million  compared with million in and million in  due to additional borrowings during used primarily to finance the repurchase of our common stock and to partially fund the acquisition of systemhouse 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
also included in other income expense during was the recognition of a non taxable gain of million resulting from the sale of stock in connection with ugs initial public offering 
no taxes were provided for this gain  as we believe we will recover our basis in the shares sold in a tax free manner 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates in  and were   and  respectively 
the increase in was due to a charge of million for the write off of acquired in process r d  which is not deductible for tax purposes  and the decrease in was due to a non taxable gain of million from the sale of stock as discussed above 
net income 
net income including all charges  gains and adjustments discussed above increased to  million in  compared with million in and million in basic earnings per share increased to per share in  compared with in and in diluted earnings per share increased to per share in  compared with in and in as discussed above  during we recorded a charge of million related to acquired in process r d  a net reversal of million associated with restructuring activities and gains of million resulting from the disposition of certain investments 
excluding these charges and gains  net income for would have been  million and basic and diluted earnings per share would have been and  respectively 
during we recorded restructuring and other charges  net of the reversal of certain previously recorded accruals  of  million and recorded gains of million resulting from the disposition of certain investments 
excluding these charges and gains  net income for would have been million and basic and diluted earnings per share would have been and  respectively 
during we recorded certain charges and adjustments  including million related to senior executive retirements  million for a write off associated with acquired in process r d  million for asset write downs and million for revenue adjustments resulting primarily from a legal dispute with a client 
the negative impact of these items was partially offset by a gain of million associated with the sale of stock of ugs  a gain of million related to the sale of a portion of our leasing portfolio and positive adjustments of million to reverse accruals related to previously recorded restructuring charges 
excluding these charges  gains and adjustments  net income would have been million  and basic and diluted earnings per share would have been and  respectively

our estimates of total revenues and expenses on client contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of our contractual arrangements 
in addition  cost saving initiatives and productivity improvements generally result in the reduction of estimated total contract expenses on affected client contracts 
for client contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  such changes are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
seasonality and inflation 
our revenues and net income vary over the calendar year  with the fourth quarter generally reflecting the highest revenues and net income for the year due to certain services that are purchased more heavily in that quarter as a result of the spending patterns of several clients 
in addition  revenues generally increase from quarter to quarter as a result of new business added throughout the year 
inflation generally had little effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
financial position assets 
total assets increased to billion at december   up from billion at december  at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million  had working capital of billion and a current ratio of to this compares with cash and cash equivalents of million  million in working capital  and a current ratio of to at december  liabilities and shareholders equity 
total debt decreased slightly to billion at december   from billion at december  total debt consists of notes payable  commercial paper and redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries 
total debt increased billion  to billion at december   when compared with billion at december   due to additional borrowings used primarily to finance the repurchase of our common stock and to partially fund the acquisition of systemhouse 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately billion 
this repurchase is intended to serve as a hedge against our long term exposure to earnings per share dilution with respect to outstanding options and restricted stock units 
the total debt to capital ratio which includes total debt and minority interests as components of capital was and at december  and at both december  and  we had committed lines of credit of approximately billion  all unused  which serve as a backup facility for commercial paper borrowings 
market risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments  are included in the notes to the financial statements 
interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the issuance of short term commercial paper and variable rate notes 
however  the effects of interest rate changes are reduced by our management of our debt portfolio between fixed and variable rate instruments as well as the utilization of interest rate swaps 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had short term market interest rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
publicly traded equity price sensitivity 
our financial position is affected by changes in publicly traded equity prices as a result of certain investments 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in the value of our publicly traded equity security investments 
if the market price of our investments in publicly traded equity securities in were to fall by below the level at the end of  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had the market price of our investments in publicly traded equity securities fallen by below the level at the end of  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct business in the united states and around the world 
our most significant foreign currency transaction exposures relate to canada  the united kingdom  those western european countries who use the euro as a common currency  australia and new zealand 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against foreign currency exchange risk from intercompany financing and trading transactions 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with durations of generally less than months to hedge such transactions 
we have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market  with gains and losses recognized in earnings  on a current basis 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates averaged more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had foreign currency rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities decreased to billion  as compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared with was due primarily to changes in working capital items  partially offset by an increase in net income 
the decrease in as compared with was due primarily to a decrease in net income  partially offset by changes in working capital items 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities decreased million  to billion  when compared to this decrease was due primarily to payments of approximately billion in related to the acquisition of systemhouse 
this decrease was partially offset by reduced proceeds from investments and other assets and increases in payments for purchases of software and other intangibles in for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities increased billion from  to billion  due primarily to payments related to the acquisition of systemhouse 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities decreased million  to million  compared with million in  due primarily to a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock partially offset by a reduction in net proceeds from commercial paper and long term debt 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities decreased million  to million  compared with million in  due primarily to an increase in net proceeds from commercial paper and long term debt partially offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock 
we paid cash dividends totaling million  million and million  respectively  in  and we expect that the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures and working capital 
capital expenditures may consist of purchases of computer and telecommunications equipment  buildings and facilities  land and software  as well as acquisitions and joint ventures 
we estimate that projected gross capital expenditures during  excluding acquisition and joint venture activities as well as proceeds from divestitures  will be approximately billion 
total capital expenditures for will depend to a significant extent on the level of additional acquisition and joint venture activities by eds  capital requirements for new business and proceeds from divestitures 
we anticipate that cash reserves  cash flows from operations and unused borrowing capacity under the existing lines of credit will provide sufficient funds to meet our needs for at least the next year 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the provisions of this statement  as amended  require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of the derivative 
the adoption of this standard on january   will result in a one time increase in net income of million  and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  primarily related to the reclassification of certain available for sale equity securities into the trading portfolio 
in the fourth quarter of  the fasb announced  in connection with finalizing the new accounting standard for business combinations  its tentative conclusion that goodwill arising from business combinations  including prior business combinations  would no longer be required to be amortized 
goodwill would instead be reviewed for impairment  and the value would be written down only in periods in which the value of goodwill is more than fair value 
the final standard on business combinations is expected to be issued by the fasb in the third quarter of  but the fasb s tentative conclusion is subject to change  and there can be no assurance when or if a final standard will be issued
