except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described below under additional factors that may affect future results 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast tm splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  intellipac breathable membranes for the fresh cut produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems for the industrial specialties market in june  and intellicoat coated inbred corn seeds in the fall of revenues related to research contracts are recognized ratably over the related funding periods for each contract  which is generally as research is performed 
product sales are recognized upon shipment except for shipments sent fob destination in which revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer 
services revenue is recognized when the service is rendered 
the company previously recognized noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees as revenue when received and when all significant contractual obligations of the company relating to the fees had been met 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees to recognize such fees over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
the company believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of november   was reported as a charge in the year ended october  on december   the company acquired apio  inc and certain related entities apio 
apio is a leading marketer and packer of produce and specialty packaged fresh cut vegetables 
see business description of core business food products technology business apio  inc during fiscal years through  the company managed its operations in three business segments food products technology  agricultural seed technology and industrial high performance materials 
with the acquisition of apio  the company will be focusing on two core businesses food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intellipac breathable membrane technology with apio s fresh cut produce business 
the agricultural seed technology segment integrates the intellicoat seed coating technology with fielder s choice s direct marketing  telephone sales and e commerce distribution capabilities 
the company also operates a technology licensing research and development business which develops products to be licensed outside of the company s core businesses 
dock resins  the company s polymer manufacturer supports the polymer needs of these core businesses and manufactures products for the specialty polymer industry and intelimer polymer systems customers 
dock resins is included in the corporate and other segment 
the company has been unprofitable during each fiscal year since its inception 
from inception through october   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  total revenues were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year revenues from product sales and services increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in product sales and service revenues was primarily due to million in revenues from apio  which was acquired effective november  and from increased product sales from landec ag 
landec ag product sales increased to million in fiscal year from million during fiscal year due to an increase in the volume of hybrid corn seed sold and revenue from the introduction of intellicoat seed coated products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in dock resins product sales from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decrease was a result of the continued weakness in the chemical industry during fiscal year revenues from research and development funding and from royalties decreased to  in fiscal year from  during fiscal year the decrease in research  development and royalty revenues was primarily due to the expiration of the research and development agreement with alcon laboratories  inc alcon related to the port tm ophthalmic devices  partially offset by new research and development contracts with convatec  a division of bristol myers squibb  in the area of medical adhesives  and ucb chemicals corporation in the area of industrial applications 
revenues from licensing fees for fiscal year were attributable to the company s adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees to recognize such fees over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
the adoption of sab resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment that increased the reported net loss for fiscal year by million related to upfront license fees received from the hitachi agreement and the alcon agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative effect adjustment was initially recorded as deferred revenue  and  of this deferred amount was recycled into revenue in fiscal year the  license fee revenues for fiscal year represent a milestone payment from alcon related to the port ophthalmic devices during the first quarter  which was recorded in accordance with the company s historical accounting practice 
cost of revenue consists of material  labor and overhead 
cost of revenue was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year gross profit from product sales and services as a percentage of revenue from product sales and services decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of apio s mix of products having a lower gross margin than landec s other businesses coupled with disappointing results in apio s stone fruit business during fiscal year  and apio s higher costs associated with sourcing crops during the winter months 
in addition  during fiscal year  landec incurred startup costs associated with apio s new value added food processing plant and establishing a new manufacturing facility in menlo park for intellipac breathable membrane products 
overall gross profit increased from million in fiscal year to million during fiscal year  an increase of 
this increase is primarily due to gross profit from apio of million partially offset by lower license fee gross profits in fiscal year compared to fiscal year research and development expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of 
landec s research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses involved in the development of  process scale up of  and efforts to protect intellectual property content of landec s enabling side chain crystallizable polymer technology and research and development expenses related to dock resins products 
the decrease in research and development expenses during fiscal year compared to fiscal year were primarily due to substantially reduced port research and development activities and the shift in intellicoat seed coating to less research and development and greater production efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses  and staff and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of expenses from apio of million  and increased sales and marketing expenses associated with marketing efforts at landec ag 
specifically  sales and marketing expenses increased to million during fiscal year from million for fiscal year landec expects that total selling  general and administrative spending for existing and newly acquired products will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although it may vary as a percentage of total revenues 
in september  due to disappointing financial results  management of landec decided to discontinue processing fruit at its reedley facility 
the company has put the facility and the packing and cold storage assets up for sale 
the company will continue to provide field support and sales and marketing services to current contracted growers through apio s existing staff and will outsource all remaining services to third parties 
as a result of the shutdown of the reedley facility  the company recorded a  charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  primarily for severance and payroll related costs 
the sale is expected to result in a gain 
the current net book value of the assets is million 
the company anticipates closing a sale during the second fiscal quarter of interest income for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year this increase in interest income was due principally to interest earned on apio s notes receivable 
interest expense for fiscal year was million  compared to  for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the increase in debt from the acquisition of apio 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  total revenues were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year revenues from product sales increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to increased product sales from landec ag and intellipac breathable membrane products which increased from million and million  respectively  in fiscal year to million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the increase in landec ag revenues was primarily due to increased per unit sales prices  and the increase in intellipac breathable membrane revenues was primarily due to the introduction of various new products and increased volumes for existing products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in dock resins product sales from million during fiscal year to million during fiscal year this decrease was a result of the overall weakness in the chemical industry during fiscal year revenues from research and development funding were  for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in research and development revenues was primarily due to the completion of research and development arrangements with hitachi chemical and nitta corporation in fiscal year revenues from license fees during fiscal year were  compared to  during fiscal year the increase in revenues from license fees was due to a payment received from alcon in fiscal year upon meeting a certain milestone related to the licensing agreement for the port ophthalmic devices 
cost of product sales was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year gross profit from product sales as a percentage of product sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross profit from product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of higher average selling prices of landec ag products  partially offset by start up costs associated with establishing a new manufacturing facility in menlo park for intellipac breathable membrane products late in fiscal year research and development expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increased development costs for the company s intellicoat seed coating products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
specifically  sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal year  from million for fiscal year net interest income was  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year the decrease during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due principally to less cash being available for investing 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   landec had cash and cash equivalents of million  a net increase of million from million as of october  this increase was primarily due to a net borrowings under landec s lines of credit of million  b cash acquired in the acquisition of apio of million  c cash from operations of million  d cash from the sale of common stock of million  partially offset by e the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment  f advances to growers of million  g payments on long term debt of million  and h acquisition related costs of million 
during fiscal year  landec purchased equipment to support the development of intellipac and intellicoat products  incurred building improvement and equipment upgrade expenditures at dock resins and apio to expand capacity  and constructed a new pilot facility for intellicoat seed coating products in indiana 
these expenditures represented the majority of the million of property and equipment purchased during fiscal year in november the company raised million upon the sale of preferred stock million net of issuance costs 
in december   in conjunction with the acquisition of apio  the company secured million of term debt and a million line of credit with bank of america 
the term debt and line of credit agreements loan agreement contain restrictive covenants that require apio to meet certain financial tests  including minimum levels of ebitda as defined in the loan agreement  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum current ratio  minimum adjusted net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
these requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time 
the loan agreement  through restricted payment covenants  limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec  until the outstanding balance is reduced to an amount specified in the loan agreement 
in june  landec ag established a million bank line of credit for working capital needs and a million equipment line of credit to be used to fund the expansion of the manufacturing capabilities of intellicoat seed coating products 
landec believes that these new facilities  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and existing borrowing capacities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
borrowings on landec s lines of credit are expected to vary with seasonal requirements of the company s businesses 
the company may  however  raise additional funds during the next twelve months through another debt financing or an equity financing 
if an equity financing occurs it will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders 
landec s future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  the development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  the continued assimilation and integration of apio into landec  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  adverse weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  the amount of future earn out payments  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms if at all 
additional factors that may affect future results landec desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e and rule b under the securities exchange act of specifically  landec wishes to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in this report  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  landec s actual results and could cause landec s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of landec 
landec assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
we have a history of losses which may continue landec has incurred net losses in each fiscal year since its inception 
landec s accumulated deficit as of october  totaled million 
landec may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that landec will be able to reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
our substantial indebtedness could limit our financial and operating flexibility at october   landec s total debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations  was approximately million and the total debt to equity ratio was approximately 
this level of indebtedness could have significant consequences because a substantial portion of landec s net cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes  landec s ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited  and landec s level of indebtedness may limit its flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and economic conditions generally 
in connection with the apio acquisition  landec may be obligated to make future payments to the former stockholders of apio of up to million 
of this amount  million was paid in january and is due to be paid in march landec s ability to service its indebtedness will depend on its future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond landec s control 
if landec were unable to service its debt  it would be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets  restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital  which might not be successful and which could substantially dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
apio is subject to various financial and operating covenants under its term debt and line of credit facilities  including minimum levels of ebitda as defined in the loan agreement  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum current ratio  minimum adjusted net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
these requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time 
the loan agreement limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec until the outstanding balance is reduced to an amount specified in the loan agreement 
landec ag and dock resins are subject to certain restrictive covenants such as the ability of landec to receive payments on debt owed to landec 
landec has pledged substantially all of apio s  landec ag s and dock resins assets to secure their bank debt 
landec s failure to comply with the obligations under the loan agreement  including maintenance of financial ratios  could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of the indebtedness due under the loan agreement 
our future operating results are likely to fluctuate which may cause our stock price to decline in the past  landec s results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue in the future 
historically  landec s direct marketer of hybrid corn seed  intellicoat  has been the primary source of these fluctuations  as its revenues and profits are concentrated over a few months during the spring planting season generally during landec s second quarter 
in addition  apio can be heavily affected by seasonal and weather factors which could impact quarterly results  such as the lower than expected volumes and poor yields experienced in the stone fruit business during the third quarter of fiscal year landec s earnings in its food products technology business will be sensitive to price fluctuations in the fresh vegetables and fruits markets 
excess supplies can cause intense price competition 
other factors affecting landec s food and or agricultural operations include the seasonality of its supplies  the ability to process produce during critical harvest periods  the timing and effects of ripening  the degree of perishability  the effectiveness of worldwide distribution systems  the terms of various federal and state marketing orders  total worldwide industry volumes  the seasonality of consumer demand  foreign currency fluctuations  foreign importation restrictions and foreign political risks 
as a result of these and other factors  landec expects to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results  and there can be no assurance that landec will be able to reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
we may experience difficulties in integrating apio and other new business acquisitions landec s acquisition of apio involves the integration of apio s operations into landec 
the integration will require the dedication of management resources in order to achieve the anticipated operating efficiencies of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given that difficulties encountered in integrating the operations of apio into landec will be overcome or that the benefits expected from integration will be realized 
the difficulties in combining apio and landec s operations are exacerbated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separate organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined companies business 
the successful integration of other new business acquisitions may require substantial effort from landec s management 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on landec s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
the successful combination of new businesses also requires coordination of research and development activities  manufacturing  and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining organizations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  landec s activities 
there can be no assurance that landec will be able to retain key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel  or that landec will realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
we may not be able to achieve acceptance of our new products in the marketplace the success of landec in generating significant sales of its products will depend in part on the ability of landec and its partners and licensees to achieve market acceptance of landec s new products and technology 
the extent to which  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by landec s current and future products are a function of many variables including  but not limited to  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  conversion costs and marketing and sales efforts  as well as general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
there can be no assurance that markets for landec s new products will develop or that landec s new products and technology will be accepted and adopted 
the failure of landec s new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on landec s business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that landec will be able to successfully develop  commercialize  achieve market acceptance of or reduce the costs of producing landec s new products  or that landec s competitors will not develop competing technologies that are less expensive or otherwise superior to those of landec 
there can be no assurance that landec will be able to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner or that new products and technologies will gain market acceptance 
landec is in the early stage of product commercialization of intellipac breathable membrane  intellicoat seed coating and intelimer polymer systems products and many of its potential products are in development 
landec believes that its future growth will depend in large part on its ability to develop and market new products in its target markets and in new markets 
in particular  landec expects that its ability to compete effectively with existing food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies will depend substantially on successfully developing  commercializing  achieving market acceptance of and reducing the cost of producing landec s products 
in addition  commercial applications of landec s temperature switch polymer technology are relatively new and evolving 
we face strong competition in the marketplace competitors may succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by landec or that would render landec s technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
landec operates in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition from large food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies is expected to be intense 
in addition  the nature of landec s collaborative arrangements may result in its corporate partners and licensees becoming competitors of landec 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than landec  and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
we have limited manufacturing experience and may have to depend on third parties to manufacture our products landec may need to consider seeking collaborative arrangements with other companies to manufacture some of its products 
if landec becomes dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of its products  then landec s profit margins and its ability to develop and deliver those products on a timely basis may be affected 
failures by third parties may impair landec s ability to deliver products on a timely basis  impair landec s competitive position  or may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval 
in late fiscal  in an effort to reduce reliance on third party manufacturers  landec began the set up of a manufacturing operation at its facility in menlo park  california  for the production of intellipac breathable membrane packaging products 
there can be no assurance that landec can successfully operate a manufacturing operation at acceptable costs  with acceptable yields  and retain adequately trained personnel 
although landec believes dock resins will provide landec with practical knowledge in the scale up of intelimer polymer products  production in commercial scale quantities may involve technical challenges for landec 
landec anticipates that a portion of its products will be manufactured in the linden  new jersey facility acquired in the purchase of dock resins 
landec s reliance on this facility involves a number of potential risks  including the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  some process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  and low manufacturing yields and high manufacturing costs 
in february  dock resins had a fire in its research and development laboratory in linden  new jersey which interrupted its ability to develop new products and samples for potential and existing customers 
our dependence on single suppliers may cause disruption in our operations should any supplier fail to deliver materials no assurance can be given that landec will not experience difficulty is acquiring materials for the manufacture of its products or that landec will be able to obtain substitute vendors  or that landec will be able to procure comparable materials or hybrid corn varieties at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time 
many of the raw materials used in manufacturing landec s products are currently purchased from a single source  including some monomers used to synthesize intelimer polymers and substrate materials for landec s breathable membrane products 
in addition  virtually all of the hybrid corn varieties sold by fielder s choice are purchased from a single source 
any interruption of supply could delay product shipments and materially harm our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights landec has received  and may in the future receive  from third parties  including some of its competitors  notices claiming that it is infringing third party patents or other proprietary rights 
if landec were determined to be infringing any third party patent  landec could be required to pay damages  alter its products or processes  obtain licenses or cease the infringing activities 
if landec is required to obtain any licenses  there can be no assurance that landec will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by landec  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to landec or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
any litigation or interference proceeding  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming and could subject landec to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require landec to cease using that technology 
landec s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent applications will be approved  that landec will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable  that any patents issued to landec will provide landec with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating landec s technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of landec s products or design around landec s patents 
our operations are subject to environmental regulations that directly impact our business federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the use  storage  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in some of the manufacturing processes  including those utilized by dock resins 
as a result of historic off site disposal practices  dock resins was involved in two actions seeking to compel the generators of hazardous waste to remediate hazardous waste sites 
dock resins has been informed by its counsel that it was a de minimis generator to these sites  and these actions have been settled without the payment of any material amount by landec 
in addition  the new jersey industrial site recovery act isra requires an investigation and remediation of any industrial establishment  like dock resins  which changes ownership 
this statute was activated by landec s acquisition of dock resins 
dock resins has completed its investigation of the site  delineated the limited areas of concern on the site  and completed the bulk of the active remediation required under the statute 
the costs associated with this effort are being borne by the former owner of dock resins  and counsel has advised dock resins and landec that funds of the former owner required by isra to be set aside for this effort are sufficient to pay for the successful completion of remedial activities at the site 
in most cases  landec believes its liability will be limited to sharing clean up or other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties 
any failure by landec to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended and changes in environmental regulations may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
landec s agricultural operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws including the food quality protection act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process 
environmental concerns are  however  inherent in most agricultural operations  including those conducted by landec  and there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be material 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies and further restrictions on the use of manufacturing chemicals could result in increased compliance costs 
adverse weather conditions can cause substantial decreases in our sales and or increases in our costs landec s food products and agricultural seed technology businesses are subject to weather conditions that affect commodity prices  crop yields  and decisions by growers regarding crops to be planted 
crop diseases and severe conditions  particularly weather conditions such as floods  droughts  frosts  windstorms and hurricanes may adversely affect the supply of vegetables and fruits used in landec s business  which could reduce the sales volumes and or increase the unit production costs 
in early fiscal year  optimal weather conditions resulted in an over supply of certain crops in which the company had an invested interest 
the over supply resulted in reduced prices for these crops which caused the company to report a loss on its investment 
because a significant portion of the costs are fixed and contracted in advance of each operating year  volume declines due to production interruptions or other factors could result in increases in unit production costs which could result in substantial losses and weaken landec s financial condition 
we have limited sales and marketing experience with our intelimer polymer products landec has only limited experience marketing and selling its intelimer polymer products 
while dock resins will provide consultation and in some cases direct marketing support for landec s intelimer polymer products  establishing sufficient marketing and sales capability will require significant resources 
landec intends to distribute some of its products through its corporate partners and other distributors and to sell other products through a direct sales force 
there can be no assurance that landec will be able to recruit and retain skilled sales management  direct salespersons or distributors  or that landec s sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
to the extent that landec has entered into or will enter into distribution or other collaborative arrangements for the sale of its products  landec will be dependent on the efforts of third parties 
we depend on strategic partners and licenses for future development for some of its current and future products  landec s strategy for development  clinical and field testing  manufacture  commercialization and marketing includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners  licensees and others 
landec is dependent on its corporate partners to develop  test  manufacture and or market some of its products 
although landec believes that its partners in these collaborations have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within the control of landec 
there can be no assurance that those partners will perform their obligations as expected or that landec will derive any additional revenue from the arrangements 
there can be no assurance that landec s partners will pay any additional option or license fees to landec or that they will develop  market or pay any royalty fees related to products under the agreements 
moreover  some of the collaborative agreements provide that they may be terminated at the discretion of the corporate partner  and some of the collaborative agreements provide for termination under other circumstances 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the amount of royalties  if any  on future sales of quickcast and port products as landec no longer has control over the sales of those products since the sale of quickcast and the license of the port product lines 
there can be no assurance that landec s partners will not pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to landec s technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that landec will be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that the collaborative arrangements will be successful 
both domestic and foreign government regulations can have an adverse effect on our business operations landec s products and operations are subject to governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
the manufacture of landec s products is subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that landec will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive approvals or loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on landec s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although landec has no reason to believe that it will not be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of its products and polymer materials  regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold 
there can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or interpretations relating to matters such as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  environmental controls  and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances will not adversely affect landec s business 
there can be no assurance that landec will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations in the future  or that the laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on landec s business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the apio acquisition  landec is subject to usda rules and regulations concerning the safety of the food products handled and sold by apio  and the facilities in which they are packed and processed 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspensions or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  product seizures  including cessation of manufacturing and sales  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
our international operations and sales may expose our business to additional risks during fiscal year  approximately of landec s total revenues were derived from product sales to and collaborative agreements with international customers 
landec expects that with the acquisition of apio and its export business  international revenues will become an important component of its total revenues 
a number of risks are inherent in international transactions

foreign regulatory agencies have or may establish product standards different from those in the united states  and any inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on landec s international business and its financial condition and results of operations 
while landec s foreign sales are currently priced in dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  such as those recently experienced in many asian countries  may reduce the demand for landec s products by increasing the price of landec s products in the currency of the countries to which the products are sold

cancellations or delays of orders by our customers may adversely affect our business during fiscal year  sales to landec s top five customers accounted for approximately of landec s revenues  with the top customer accounting for of landec s revenues 
landec expects that for the foreseeable future a limited number of customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of its net revenues 
landec may experience changes in the composition of its customer base  as apio  dock resins and intellicoat have experienced in the past 
landec does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of the major customers could materially and adversely affect landec s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  since some of the products manufactured in the linden  new jersey facility or processed by apio at its guadalupe  california facility are often sole sourced to its customers  landec s operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of its major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
there can be no assurance that landec s current customers will continue to place orders  that orders by existing customers will not be canceled or will continue at the levels of previous periods or that landec will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our sale of some products may increase our exposure to product liability claims the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of the products being developed by landec involve an inherent risk of allegations of product liability 
while no product liability claims have been made against landec to date  if any product liability claims were made and adverse judgments obtained  they could have a material adverse effect on landec s business  operating results and financial condition

our stock price may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions factors such as announcements of technological innovations  the attainment of or failure to attain milestones in the commercialization of landec s technology  new products  new patents or changes in existing patents  the acquisition of new businesses or the sale or disposal of a part of landec s businesses  or development of new collaborative arrangements by landec  its competitors or other parties  as well as government regulations  investor perception of landec  fluctuations in landec s operating results and general market conditions in the industry may cause the market price of landec s common stock to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of technology companies and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of technology companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of landec s common stock 
the implementation of financial and accounting changes may cause an increase in costs and delays in order to address deficiencies in apio s management information systems and accounting systems  apio has restructured its financial and accounting department  including hiring a chief financial officer and a new controller  and retained consultants who have worked with apio to improve accounting processes and procedures 
apio management believes that those changes will improve its managing of operations  including delivering complete and accurate financial statements to landec s corporate offices in a more timely manner 
however  landec can give no assurances that it will be able to effect those changes in the management information systems and accounting systems in a timely manner or sustain the process improvements over time 
the euro currency may cause some disruptions in business on january   some member states of the european economic community fixed their respective currencies to a new currency  commonly known as the euro 
during the three years beginning on january   business in these countries will be conducted both in the existing national currency  as well as the euro 
companies operating in or conducting business in these countries will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling the existing currencies and the euro 
based on the current level of direct european business conducted by landec  and also because landec expects that any transactions in europe in the near future will be priced in us dollars  landec does not expect that introduction and use of the euro will materially affect landec s business 
landec will continue to evaluate the impact over time of the introduction of the euro 
however  if landec encounters unexpected opportunities or difficulties in europe  landec s business could be adversely affected  including the inability to bill customers and to pay suppliers for transactions denominated in the euro and the inability to properly record transactions denominated in the euro in landec s financial statements
