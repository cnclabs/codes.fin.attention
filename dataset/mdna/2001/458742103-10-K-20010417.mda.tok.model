overview we are a leading global application service provider  or asp  providing our customers with a focused suite of outsourced e business solutions 
as an asp  we provide managed services for complex hosted applications to multiple end users from our data centers across a wide area network 
our customers face significant challenges in doing business on the internet due to its technical complexity  their lack of technical skills  the time necessary to implement solutions and the cost of implementation and ongoing support 
by providing outsourced solutions that combine our hosting infrastructure with professional services expertise  we can rapidly design  implement  deploy and effectively manage cost effective solutions for our customers 
we offer our customers a suite of services focused on their non core but critical business functions enabling them to focus on their own core competencies 
the following are the principal services and products we provide to our customers 
hosting infrastructure for network based applications  which allows our customers to store their databases  applications or web sites on equipment owned and maintained by us or on their equipment located in our data centers  or at their premises by means of remote access  
a focused suite of business solutions that include collaboration  managed hosting and security  
professional services for designing  implementing and deploying these and other internet based applications  and 
operations support  systems and applications management  and customer services 
since our inception we have acquired operating companies providing application hosting  web hosting and asp professional services solutions  for total consideration of approximately million 
we have built or acquired our data centers and have integrated all or part of the acquired hosting operations into those data centers 
the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  which has resulted in the recognition  as of december   of approximately million of intangible assets 
recoverability of our investment in intangible assets is dependent on our ability to successfully operate our businesses and generate positive cash flows from operations 
intangible amortization charges will result in increased losses or reduced net income 
the purchase consideration for the acquisitions was in the form of cash  stock or a combination of cash  stock and issuance of debt 
for the period from inception to december   we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations  and have expended significant funds for capital expenditures property and equipment and the acquisition of businesses 
our principal sources of cash to fund the aforementioned activities were from the sale of million in common and preferred stock in public and private sales and the sale of million of convertible subordinated notes 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of which million is available for use in our wholly owned operations  and million is available for use in our owned subsidiary  interliant europe bv our financial forecast indicates that such funds on hand at december  will not alone be sufficient to fund our operations  including expected restructuring costs in  debt service and capital requirements  through we have  however  entered into definitive agreements for the million funding see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the funds on hand as of december   combined with the million funding  will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our obligations through december  we believe it is likely that we will require additional funding to conduct operations beyond we are seeking additional sources of cash to fund our business plan 
accordingly  we intend to sell certain of our businesses and assets which are no longer core to our ongoing business plans see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
any proceeds from these planned sales will be used to further fund our ongoing operations 
however  there can be no assurances that we will successfully consummate a sale of any or all of the businesses and assets or whether any such sale  if completed  will result in additional material cash funding to further support our ongoing operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the revenue and income potential of our business is unproven and our limited operating history makes an evaluation of us and our prospects difficult 
we anticipate increased operating expenses as we 
expand our sales and marketing initiative to continue to drive increased sales leads  
continue to fund product development  
continue to complete and equip our data centers  and 
implement billing  accounting  operations and customer service systems 
although we have experienced revenue growth  which to date has been primarily attributable to acquisitions  we do not believe that this growth is necessarily indicative of future operating results 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses  including depreciation and amortization expense  as well as negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we cannot be assured that we will ever achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  or  if achieved  that we will sustain profitability 
recent business developments  business restructuring during the latter half of the first quarter of  we experienced a substantial decline in revenues and new sales orders 
there were negative economic developments and trends that occurred during this period in our industry sector  including reduced corporate information technology spending  the failure of many internet related companies  and sharply reduced sales forecasts 
all of these factors caused us to re evaluate our business focus and operating plans for the remainder of and beyond 
such decisions gave rise to the following actions based on a decision reached by our management and the board of directors in late march  on april  we announced a restructuring plan the april plan or restructuring to further streamline the business by narrowing our services focus to a core set of offerings 
the april plan comprises a workforce reduction and the exit of certain non core businesses 
in conjunction with the restructuring  we undertook a review of our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges sab to ascertain if these decisions and changed conditions caused an impairment charge 
the april plan is being executed in two phases 
phase  which began on april   consists of a workforce reduction of approximately positions and will result in a charge for the payment of severance and related costs of approximately million 
this charge will be recognized in the quarter ending june  we anticipate that the annualized cost savings from the workforce reduction will range from million to million 
the amount of these savings could change if we need to further adjust our personnel infrastructure to support ongoing operations 
phase of the april plan includes exiting  via sale  certain businesses that we determined to be outside of the redefined scope of our service offerings 
currently  no purchase and sales agreements have been entered into for any business that we plan to sell 
the businesses to be exited include the enterprise resource planning erp and customer relationship management crm product lines of the application hosting and asp professional services segments 
if the divestiture efforts are not successful in the near term  we expect to close some of these businesses by the end of businesses not closed will continue to be operated with reduced cost structures resulting  in part  from the phase workforce reductions 
in the event that we close some of the businesses  the costs associated with such activities will likely include the termination of additional employees and settlement of certain contractual obligations 
the costs of exiting the businesses will vary depending on the manner of disposition 
while those costs are not fully determinable at this time  we estimate that in the event of a shut down of certain of these businesses  the exit costs could range as follows workforce reductions million to million and termination of facility leases and other contractual obligations million to million 
we will not record a restructuring liability for the qualifying costs associated with the phase events until the criteria required under eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and sab are met  which will likely be the second or third quarter of unanticipated changes in our assumptions may cause the estimates stated above to vary materially 
also  due to the uncertainty of the outcome and timing of the phase activities  the impact on our ongoing results of operations and cash flows is not currently determinable 
as part of the restructuring activities  pursuant to sfas and sab  an impairment assessment was made with respect to the long lived assets associated with the businesses planned to be sold or shut down 
the assessment indicated that  on a held for use basis  there was impairment evident in such assets 
further  based on our assessment of internal and external facts and circumstances to which the impairment was attributable  we concluded that the impairment indicators arose in the latter half of the first quarter of consequently  we preliminarily expect to record an impairment charge in the first quarter of of million to million 
it is reasonably possible that the ultimate charge will vary considerably outside of this range depending on a number of factors  such as the timing and manner of planned disposition eg  sale or shut down of the exited businesses and the amount of the proceeds realized  if any  from their sale  and the costs associated with the shut downs  as the case may be 
long lived assets that are impaired consist of property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and related goodwill 
for purposes of measuring the impairment charge  fair value was determined based on a calculation of discounted cash flows 
we are actively seeking buyers for the businesses to be exited and related assets 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to sell these assets and we have no certainty as to the amount of proceeds we will realize from any such sale 
in connection with the above events and circumstances  we also have re evaluated the assigned lives used for depreciating and amortizing  as the case may be  our long lived assets and have concluded that our existing lives continue to be appropriate under present accounting rules 
if we are successful in implementing our restructuring plans and disposing of these businesses  our future results of operations and operating cash flows will be significantly impacted 
the erp and crm hosting and professional services businesses which we plan to exit had revenues and ebitda losses in of approximately million and million  respectively 
accordingly  as a result of exiting these businesses we expect our revenues and related operating expenses to decline 
overall  these restructuring initiatives are designed to improve ebitda results and cash flows for the business 
however  due to the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of these activities  we cannot currently predict with any certainty their impact on revenues and ebitda in and beyond 
results of operations our revenues are primarily derived from application hosting  web hosting and asp professional services 
we sell application hosting and web hosting services for contractual periods generally ranging from one month to three years 
web hosting arrangements generally are cancelable by either party without penalty 
hosting revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual period as services are performed 
incremental fees for excess bandwidth usage and data storage are billed and recognized as revenue in the period that customers utilize such services 
payments received and billings made in advance of providing services are deferred until the services are provided 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
sab allows companies to report any changes in revenue recognition related to adopting its provisions as an accounting change at the time of implementation in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  effective january   for revenue recognized in for set up fees associated with web hosting and application hosting services 
prior to the adoption of sab  we recognized revenue from non refundable set up fees charged to customers upon completion of the set up services 
effective january   such fees  which are primarily generated from web hosting services  are being amortized over the longer of the contractual period or expected life of the customer relationship one year 
professional services revenues generally are recognized as the services are rendered  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is considered probable 
substantially all of our professional services contracts call for billings on a time and materials basis 
some of our contracts contain milestones and or customer acceptance provisions 
for these contracts  revenue is recognized as milestones are performed and accepted by the customer or when customer acceptance is received 
certain customer contracts contain multiple elements under which we sell a combination of any of the following application hosting and professional services  computer equipment  software licenses and maintenance services to customers 
we have determined that objective evidence of fair value exists for all elements and have recorded revenue for each of the elements as follows revenue from the sale of computer equipment and software products is recorded at the time of delivery  revenue from service contracts is recognized as the services are performed  and maintenance revenue and related costs are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
under certain arrangements  we resell computer equipment and or software and maintenance purchased from various computer equipment and software vendors 
we are recording the revenue from these products and services on a gross basis pursuant to eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
under these arrangements  we determined that we are the primary obligor 
we present the end user with a total solution  provides the end user with a choice from various vendor products  sets final prices and performs certain services 
additionally  we have credit and back end inventory risk 
as of december   we had approximately million of computer hardware and software inventory on hand 
as a software reseller we apply the provisions of statement of position  sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position under sop  we recognize license revenue upon shipment of a product to the end user if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
for contracts with multiple elements eg  software products  maintenance and other services  we allocate revenue to each element of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence of the element s fair value 
cost of revenues primarily consists of salaries and related expenses associated with asp professional services and data center operations  data center facilities costs  costs of hardware and software products sold to customers  and data communications expenses  including one time fees for circuit installation and variable recurring circuit payments to network providers 
monthly circuit charges vary based upon circuit type  distance and usage  as well as the term of the contract with the carrier 
sales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs associated with the direct sales force  internal telesales  product development and product marketing employees  as well as costs associated with marketing programs  advertising  product literature  external telemarketing costs and corporate marketing activities  including public relations 
general and administrative expense includes the cost of customer service functions  finance and accounting  human resources  legal and executive salaries  corporate overhead  acquisition integration costs and fees paid for professional services

asp professional services revenues increased million  from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to acquisitions completed during and the second half of cost of revenues cost of revenues increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions consummated during and  and increased costs  including but not limited to additional data center facilities and personnel  to support growth 
in the future  cost of revenues may fluctuate due to capacity utilization  the timing of investments in data centers  changes in the mix of services  fluctuations in bandwidth costs and increased levels of staffing to support anticipated growth 
gross margin was for as compared to for the lower gross margins are the result of an increase in the proportion of revenue from asp professional services and products  which typically generate lower gross margins as compared with our hosting services 
the increase in asp professional services and product revenue was primarily the result of the completion of six acquisitions of such businesses since the second half of sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was attributable in part to the acquisitions consummated during and additionally  we continued the expansion of our direct sales force  increased marketing efforts focusing on sales lead generation and brand promotion  and developed reseller and referral partner channels 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to be a substantial component of our cost structure in future periods to support anticipated revenue growth 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase in general and administrative expense was attributable to the acquisitions consummated during and  non cash compensation charges of million primarily related to the ceo option grant described below  and increased investments in internal systems and facilities  and staffing levels with respect to the customer service  billing  accounting and human resources functions to support revenue growth 
in february  we issued options to purchase  shares of common stock to our chief executive officer at exercise prices that were below the market price of our common stock at the date of grant ceo option grant 
such options were not issued pursuant to our stock option plan 
in total  the intrinsic value of these options approximated million  and for the year ended december   we charged million to non cash compensation expense in connection with this arrangement 
restructuring charge in september  we announced a plan to accelerate our acquisition integration program by consolidating geographically dispersed functions 
the plan includes the elimination of approximately jobs  the exit of certain leased facilities and other related contractual arrangements  and the termination of a software development project 
the workforce reduction plan includes job eliminations in operations and information systems  customer care  sales  marketing and business development  and finance and administration 
in connection therewith  we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the three months ended september  as of december   million of the restructuring reserve was utilized and employees were terminated under the plan 
the plan is expected to be completed by june  after the completion of this restructuring effort we expect to realize annualized cost savings ranging from million to million 
the foregoing is a forward looking statement and is based on our current business plan and the assumptions on which it is based 
depreciation depreciation expense increased by million  from million in to million in the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to the acquisitions consummated during and  and investments in network software and equipment  furniture and office equipment  and leasehold improvements during and the second half of the fixed asset additions were driven by the expansion of our data centers and customer care facilities and customer driven computer equipment and software purchases to support revenue growth 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase in amortization expense was attributable to the acquisitions consummated during and interest income expense  net net interest income expense decreased by million  from million of net interest income in to million of net interest expense in interest expense increased million  from million in to million in as a result of the issuance of the subordinated convertible notes in february and capital lease obligations to finance equipment and furniture purchases during interest income increased million  from million in to million in this increase primarily was the result of income associated with investments of cash proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity financings completed in years ended december  and the following table sets forth in comparative format the historical results of operations for and year ended december  of of historical revenues historical revenues dollars in millions revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of intangibles interest and other income  net net loss revenues revenues increased million  from million in to million in the increase in revenues was due primarily to the acquisitions consummated during and cost of revenues cost of revenues increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to the acquisitions consummated during and  and increased costs to support growth 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was attributable in part to the acquisitions consummated during and a key component of our revenue growth strategy in was to significantly increase our sales and marketing activities which will included the expansion of our sales force  increased marketing efforts focused on sales lead generation  and the development of reseller and referral partner channels 
as a result  sales and marketing expenses was a substantial component of our cost structure 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase in general and administrative expense was attributable to the acquisitions consummated during and  an increase of million in non cash compensation expense  and increased investments in infrastructure and levels of staffing with respect to the billing  accounting  human resources and customer service functions to support revenue growth 
depreciation depreciation expense increased by million  from million in to million in the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to the acquisitions consummated during and and our investment in equipment  furniture and construction to complete and equip our data centers in atlanta  georgia and vienna  virginia 
amortization amortization expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase in amortization expense was attributable to the acquisitions consummated during and liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and acquisitions primarily from private placements of debt and equity  and our initial public offering of common stock 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   including million held by interliant europe  a consolidated subsidiary that is owned by us 
on april   we entered into a definitive agreement with affiliates of charterhouse group international  inc charterhouse and softbank technology ventures vi  lp and its related funds softbank under which they agreed to purchase  in the aggregate  units units  each unit consisting of  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes notes and  warrants warrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock for a total sales price of million 
under the definitive agreement we have the right to require charterhouse and softbank to purchase their respective share of the units  or a portion thereof  through april  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time prior to maturity  into common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment  which is equal to  shares of common stock  per  principal amount of the notes 
interest payments will be payable on the last day of each calendar quarter by the issuance of additional notes 
the notes mature on june  the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire five years after issuance 
at the same time  we entered into a definitive agreement with eyt  inc eyt  an entity controlled by charterhouse and softbank  under which eyt committed to repurchase from us our investment in eyt for a purchase price of million  which approximates our cost of such investment 
this asset is classified as other assets on our balance sheet as of december  the closing of the eyt transaction shall take place contemporaneously with the closing of the first sale of units to charterhouse and softbank 
the above transactions are collectively referred to herein as the million funding 
during the year ended december   we used million in operating cash activities 
the net loss of million included non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges totaling million 
cash was used to fund increases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets totaling million  offset by a net increase in operating liabilities of million 
in january and february  we raised million in strategic funding from equity investments by dell computer  network solutions and bmc software 
in february and march  we sold million of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement 
semi annual interest payments of million commenced in august the notes mature on february  upon the occurrence of certain events  we may redeem the notes prior to maturity 
during the year ended december   we added million of network software and equipment  furniture and office equipment and leasehold improvements 
such fixed asset additions were primarily driven by our data center and customer care facilities expansion and customer driven computer equipment and software purchases to support revenue growth 
we currently have available lease facilities totaling approximately million  of which million was utilized as of december  the total lease capacity includes a million lease facility with dell financial services dfs  under which we are financing all dell equipment purchases 
of the million of fixed asset additions  approximately million of computer equipment was financed  including million under the dfs facility 
we expect to continue such financing activities and obtain additional equipment financing  although no assurances can be given that additional financing will be available when needed 
in addition to funding ongoing operations and capital expenditures  our principal commitments consist of non cancelable operating leases  semi annual interest payments due to holders of convertible subordinated notes and contingent earnout payments to certain sellers of operating companies acquired by us 
we completed six acquisitions in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in this form k 
the total cash consideration for these acquisitions  and contingent earnout payments in connection with acquisitions completed prior to  was million  net of acquired cash 
if all targets for earnouts entered into through december  are achieved in full  the maximum remaining cash consideration due pursuant to these earnouts will be million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  certain of these agreements provide for issuance of common stock in lieu of cash  at our option 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with the million funding  will provide sufficient funds to enable us to fund our operating needs and meet our obligations through december  the foregoing is a forward looking statement and is based on our current business plan and the assumptions on which it is based  including our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans and achieve the cost savings and cash generation benefits they are designed to produce  as well as to successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve the expected benefits  such as operational efficiencies and revenue improvements from cross selling opportunities 
if our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital sooner than we currently anticipate 
as previously discussed herein  we plan to sell certain businesses and assets and use any net proceeds from such sales to fund continuing operations 
we may also seek to raise additional capital to take advantage of favorable conditions in the capital markets 
it is highly likely that after we will need additional funds to conduct our operations  continue our internal growth programs and fund debt service obligations 
in order to fund the repayment of our existing debt service obligations  we will either have to increase revenues without a commensurate increase in costs to generate sufficient cash from operations  refinance existing debt obligations  raise additional cash through debt or equity financings  or execute a combination thereof 
we cannot be assured  however  that if we need or seek additional capital that we will be successful in obtaining it 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
at december   we had short term investments of approximately million 
these short term investments consist of highly liquid investments in debt obligations of highly rated entities with maturities of between days and one year 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we expect to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore expect to realize the full value of these investments  even though changes in interest rates may affect their value prior to maturity 
if interest rates decline over time  this will result in a reduction of our interest income by approximately million annually for each percentage decrease  based on the amount of short term investments on hand as of december  substantially all of our indebtedness bears interest at a fixed rate to maturity which therefore minimizes our exposure to interest rate fluctuations
