item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and fi nancial condition overview for the fiscal year  cone had sales of million  up marginally from sales of million in during  excluding charges for re structuring of operations and impairment of assets  cone reported improved re sults of operations as compared with while we realized approximately million in restructuring savings or cost reductions in as a result of the comprehensive restructuring plan  much of these savings were offset by lower sales prices and by manufacturing cost increases 
the year marked the third consecutive year of declining sales for the us textile industry 
while cone has made progress in its plan  the business environment continues to affect actual results adversely 
denim results improved in from as retail sales increased and we were able to operate our denim facilities at essentially full capacity after the first quarter of the year 
in addition to much improved operating sched ules in versus  we were able to liquidate in excess of million of denim inventories 
pricing continued to be difficult as a result of indus try oversupply  competitors inventory and backlog positions  and resistance to price increases at retail 
carlisle  as a component of the commission fin ishing segment  continued its turnaround 
the raytex operation as the other component of the commission finishing segment experienced deteriorating market conditions that resulted in unacceptable operating losses and led to the deci sion in december to close the facility 
the decorative fabrics segment continued to realize sales growth in  however  a continuing decline in operating results led to the installation of a new management team 
management believes that one of the most significant factors affecting op erating margins is the price of cotton  which varied between the 
s and 
s per pound through much of  and cone has purchased cot ton at fixed prices for delivery for a portion of whether cotton prices are marginally lower or higher in compared to will depend upon fac tors such as the strength of the us economy  supply and demand conditions around the world as they impact the export of us cotton and the level of equalization payments received under the us government cotton program 
other significant factors that influence cone s operating results and fi nancial condition include general business cycles  consumer fashion prefer ences  changes in demand for print fabrics  international trade conditions  the relative strength of the us dollar  market interest rates  as well as the terms on which debt financing is available to cone 
in the fourth quarter of the us economy began slowing with holiday sales at retail ranging from mixed to disappointing for apparel and home fur nishings products 
the denim and finishing businesses continued to show strong order position at year end  however  declining general economic condi tions are expected to affect growth and margins adversely for the first half of based upon general economic forecasts for improvements in the us economy in the second half of the year  cone expects improved operating re sults in the second half of in all lines with a potential for some price improvements in denim 
first half results will also be affected adversely by rising natural gas and other energy costs 
as a result of the slowing us economy  the federal reserve reduced interest rates by in the first quar ter of  which should reduce cone s borrowing cost on a portion of its debt 
long term strategic initiatives cone s business strategy is to invest and grow in its core franchises where it is recognized as a market leader 
as a result of economic and industry con ditions we have focused on four initiatives engage in businesses in which cone believes it is an industry leader  retain  attract  motivate and fo cus a talented and capable management team  migrate to low cost manufac turing platforms for commodity products  and attract and efficiently in vest capital 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon economic and industry conditions as well as our business leadership criteria  cone reached the decision to close the raytex finishing operation that served the top of bed home furnish ings markets 
cone was not a leader in this business segment and was unable to develop a business outlook that would provide an appropriate return on its in vestment in this operation 
the decision to close the facility was announced in december with the closing of operations completed in the first quarter of in  cone recognized a restructuring and impairment of asset charge of million and an million exit inventory charge related to the decision to close this facility 
the million charge includes noncash charges of million for the write off of intangible assets and mil lion for the write down of property  plant and equipment 
the remaining million charge is for employee severance benefits 
the raytex assets are held for sale  and cone s goal is to realize proceeds from the liquidation of these assets in in addition to raytex  we exited the ashima alliance in the ashima cone alliance was formed in august and consisted of four elements the purchase by cone of approximately of the capital stock of ashima ltd  an indian company  for million  cone s providing technology and tech nical services to ashima  receiving fees as compensation  cone certifica tion of certain ashima products for distribution throughout the world  and the right of cone to market ashima products outside the indian sub continent under the name ashima cone 
during the third quarter of  cone reached a mutual agreement with ashima to terminate the commercial and technical serv ices agreements between the parties 
as a result of changes in the marketplace relating to the asian financial crisis and cone s refocus on the western hemi sphere  the alliance did not have the profit potential for both parties that was initially envisioned 
in addition  the alliance became a distraction to the efficient management of cone s core businesses 
cone plans to continue to hold its equity investment in ashima and maintain a relationship so as to keep a presence in that region of the world and potentially benefit from changes in market dynamics 
the ashima group pro duces and markets a broad product line of denim and sportswear fabrics 
with the exit of the ashima alliance cone collapsed its international mar keting group into its larger textile products group infrastructure to provide for increased efficiencies and economies of scale 
in keeping with its strategy to reduce overhead costs  cone will relocate its corporate headquarters to substantially smaller leased space by year end cone also has downsized its office space in new york and will relocate to a smaller new york office in cone believes that its present business units can meet the performance cri teria that it has established 
however  given the global and capital markets environment in which cone operates  cone will continually review its busi nesses to make sure that they are capable of providing an acceptable long term return to cone s stockholders 
in  in response to deteriorating business conditions for apparel prod ucts and commission finishing cone implemented a comprehensive downsizing and reorganization program targeted at providing over million in cost savings or loss avoidance for the year the components and status of this program are cone streamlined the product offerings of the sportswear division by  among other things  closing the salisbury plant  which produced yarn dyed shirting fabrics 
the plant closing and streamlining of operations was completed in resulting in a full year of savings in from this initiative 
in  cone recognized an additional 
million restructuring charge to write down further the value of the assets held for sale  cone downsized and reorganized the corporate administrative staff  merged the denim and sportswear fabrics businesses into one unit and reduced the manufacturing staff to simplify the management struc ture 
these actions were completed in  cone closed the florence and cliffside ring spun yarn manufacturing facilities and entered into a long term yarn sourcing contract 
the closing of the yarn manufacturing portion of the facilities and outsourcing of yarn were completed in  cone restructured the carlisle plant by reducing the workforce by approximately  increasing efficiencies and quality  and refocus ing marketing activities 
workforce reductions were implemented in  and in aggregate the operating efficiency and quality targets were met or exceeded in  resulting in the targeted savings for this initiative  cone exited the chamois flannel shirting product line with the re structuring of carlisle 
the exit of this business allowed carlisle to focus on the home furnishings and bottom weight apparel fabrics markets  thereby helping it attain the efficiency and quality tar gets 
cone calculates that it achieved approximately million in cost savings as a result of these initiatives 
cone s results of operations did not improve by the amount of the realized savings as a result of other factors prevalent within the industry including continued pricing pressures  manufacturing cost increases and deteriorating general business conditions 
cone s priority for the use of cash flow and debt capacity is the invest ment in low cost denim manufacturing facilities  primarily in mexico 
in april  guilford mills  inc and cone entered into a joint venture to develop and operate a new textile and apparel industrial park in altamira  ta maulipas  mexico 
the infrastructure for the industrial park was substantially completed in february under the agreement with guilford the companies jointly developed and own the infrastructure for the industrial park 
each company individually owns the land for its respective textile operations and will contract with the jointly owned service company for infrastructure serv ices  such as water  power and waste water treatment 
the textile plant planned to be built on cone s property will be a denim plant with an initial capacity of between and million yards 
depending upon the ultimate size and configuration cone expects to invest between and million in the initial denim facility 
cone s goal is to start construction of the textile facility in late the funds required for the denim facility will require debt financing and certain modifications to current lending agreements 
cone has not arranged financing or modified its lending agreements at this date  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and conditions or that its present lenders will agree to the required modifications 
in keeping with cone s stated goal to expand capacity in mexico cone an nounced an agreement to expand parras cone s production capacity by in the expansion will cost approximately million and is expected to be completed by year end the expansion will be financed by parras cone with internally generated cash flow and debt 
financing for the expansion has not been finalized 
cone will continue to market and distribute of the pro duction of parras cone 
segment information in the years through  cone operated in three principal business segments denim and khaki  commission finishing and decorative fabrics 
in and  cone also operated in the yarn dyed products segment 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item results of operations fifty two weeks ended december  compared with fifty two weeks ended january  for the year  cone had sales of million as compared with sales of million for denim and khaki segment sales and decorative fab ric segment sales were each up offset by weaker commission finishing sales primarily at the raytex plant 
gross profit for increased to of sales  as compared with for the previous year 
if inventory charges related to the raytex closing were excluded  gross profit would have been of sales 
the improved gross profit for was a result of realization of benefits of the comprehen sive restructuring program and improved capacity utilization in the denim op erations partially offset by lower denim prices  weak market conditions for raytex and poor results for the decorative fabrics segment 
denim and khaki 
for  denim and khaki segment sales were mil lion  an increase of from sales of million 
sales volume on a yardage basis for the denim and khaki segment increased by as the denim market recovered from a downturn 
in early  cone began to experience improvements in denim market conditions  including more denim at retail and a fashion shift back to basic five pocket jeans 
these market improvements con tinued to the year end holiday season  which was not as robust as expected earlier in the year 
relatively good market demand for khaki products contin ued from until late in when cone began seeing evidence that the re tail pipeline may have become saturated 
operating income of the denim and khaki segment for was million  or of sales  compared with million  or  for the in creased margin and income resulted primarily from higher sales volume  im proved plant operating schedules after the first quarter of and the bene fit of liquidating approximately million of inventory at previous year cost levels 
these increases in gross profit were partially offset by lower sales prices  cost increases and closeouts of certain khaki inventories 
the closeout of certain khaki inventories reflects the competitiveness of the mar ket place and cone s adjustment of fashion and basics product mix for this product line 
results of the segment also reflected marginally lower cotton costs and additional writedowns on the khaki inventory 
operating income for the segment includes cone s equity in earnings from the parras cone joint ven ture plant 
commission finishing 
outside sales total segment sales less intercompany sales of the commission finishing segment  which consisted of the carlisle and raytex plants  were million for  down from million for the majority of this sales decline was at the raytex plant where the year began with weak top of bed volume  especially from the major retail brands that outsourced production  raytex s markets continued to deteriorate throughout the year 
as discussed previously  these market conditions led to cone s decision to close the raytex plant 
for carlisle  overall print market conditions did not improve in however  because of the closing of several competitors  including its largest home decorative competitor  carlisle s mar ket share increased at the end of for  the segment had an operating loss of million as compared with a loss of million in the raytex plant lost million in versus a marginal loss of less than 
million in on the same ba sis 
carlisle s results benefited from the restructuring  downsizing and refocusing of the carlisle plant 
the operating improvements at carlisle were partially offset late in by higher energy costs and the start up costs associated with new business assumed from a competitor s plant upon its closing 
intercompany sales of this segment were to the denim and khaki and decorative fabrics segments 
decorative fabrics 
for  sales of the decorative fabrics segment were million  up from sales of million for cone jacquard s sales increased by benefiting from expanded capacity and outsourcing while converting john wolf sales declined by as a result of a lack of market demand for cone s product offerings for the home furnishings market and over all weak interest in prints 
the decorative fabrics segment had a loss million in as compared with earnings of million for results for were affected negatively by the lack of market demand for cone s product offerings  start up expenses associated with increasing capacity and operating efficiencies at the jacquard plant and difficulties with outsourcing 
as part of the management restructuring  the jacquards and con verting operations have been integrated to provide for a better coordination of woven and printed products and lower selling costs 
market conditions in the furniture industry weakened in the fourth quarter of the timing and strength of the industry s recovery will have an impact on results 
yarn dyed products 
cone ceased manufacturing yarn dyed products in may for there were essentially no sales of yarn dyed products as com pared with sales of million 
for  the yarn dyed products seg ment had an operating loss of million 
the results include inventory reserves of million associated with the closing of the salisbury plant 
in addition to the segment operating losses in  million of the re structuring charges in were attributable to the yarn dyed segment 
these restructuring costs were primarily for the writedown of property  plant and equipment  as well as employee severance costs 
selling and administrative expenses for were million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales in selling and administrative expenses in were affected negatively by higher bank and legal fees associated with cone s financing agreements 
interest expense for was million  an increase of million from million for the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of increases in rates under new lending agreements and in market rates 
other expenses include million recognized in related to the ongoing expense of the new accounts receivable securitization program  which began on september  the comparable number in was million for the new accounts receivable securitization program 
for and  the income tax benefit as a percent of the taxable loss was and  respectively 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item equity in earnings of parras cone  cone s joint venture plant in mexico  was million for  as compared with million for in the period  the plant operated at a higher capacity utilization rate and experi enced lower raw material costs 
for the year  cone had a net loss of million  or per share after preferred dividends 
for comparison  in  cone had a net loss of million  or 
per share 
however  both years included significant pre tax restructuring  related expenses and inventory write downs connected with the exit from businesses

per share 
fifty two weeks ended january  compared with fifty three weeks ended january  for the year  cone mills had sales of million  down from sales of million for  primarily due to a sales shortfall in denim 
lower denim sales resulted from weaker consumer interest in jeans and adjust ments to retail and manufacturing inventories 
gross profit for decreased to of sales  as compared with for the previous year 
lower volume and pricing in denims and the aggressive elim ination of unprofitable lines and inventories more than offset the improved operating results in commission finishing and decorative fabrics 
cone encountered depressed market conditions in denim fabrics during resulting in a significant reduction of sales in the third and fourth quar ters 
retail sales of denim garments showed a slight decrease for lower denim fabric sales resulted primarily from a stronger consumer in terest in khakis  inventory adjustments by retailers and wholesalers of brands  and the continued worldwide over capacity in denims even as several competitors exited the us market 
in addition  the trend to more complex garment silhouettes affected us mills negatively as sourcing favored low cost asian producers 
as a result of these conditions  cone experienced lower margins as a result of both pricing pressures and curtailed operating sched ules aimed at controlling inventories 
cone continued to encounter manufacturing difficulties at its carlisle fin ishing plant through the first nine months of however  in the fourth quarter  carlisle benefited from cost reductions associated with its restruc turing 
the facility improved capacity utilization with a broadened customer base  improved efficiency and quality  and earned a small operating profit 
the consolidation of cone s granite finishing operations into carlisle that began in disrupted manufacturing efficiencies to a greater extent than anticipated  which materially adversely impacted results of the commission finishing segment during and during  cone ceased production of yarn dyed products and liquidated associated inventories 
adverse market conditions increased import penetration of yarn dyed products  and ineffective marketing and merchandising programs resulted in significant operating losses 
following unsuccessful attempts to make use of the salisbury yarn dyed plant profitably  cone closed this facil ity in the second quarter of in response to business conditions for apparel products and commission fin ishing  cone implemented a comprehensive downsizing and reorganization program in  which included cone streamlined the product offering of the sportswear division in cluding the closing of the salisbury plant which produced yarn dyed shirting fabrics

cone downsized and reorganized the corporate administrative staff  merged the denim and sportswear fabrics businesses into one unit and reduced the manufacturing staff to simplify the management struc ture 
these actions resulted in restructuring charges in of million and the elimination of approximately employees 
the components of the restructuring charges include million for em ployee separation costs  million for write down of equipment and million for consulting and legal fees associated with the downsizing 
consulting fees were primarily for review of the workforce  design of severance packages and legal review to ensure that cone was in compliance with laws and regulations 
cone closed the florence and cliffside ring spun yarn manufacturing facilities  coupled with the outsourcing of yarn to reduce operating costs and conserve capital that would have been required for equip ment modernization 
this action resulted in restructuring charges of million comprised of million for write down of plant and equipment and million for employee separation costs 
approximately employees were terminated 
cone restructured the carlisle plant reducing the workforce by ap proximately  increased efficiencies and quality  and refocused marketing activities 
this action in the third quarter of re sulted in restructuring charges of million  million for employee separation costs  million for consulting and legal fees and million for write down of plant and equipment 
approx imately employees were terminated with the restructuring of the carlisle operation

primary sources of liquidity are internally generated funds  a million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility and a million receivables purchase and servicing agreement the receivables agreement entered into on september   and amended on april   with cone receivables ii llc  redwood receivables corporation redwood  and general electric capital corporation 
on january   cone entered into a new million revolving credit facility with its existing banks with bank of america  na  as agent  ratably secured  together with the senior note and the debentures  by substan tially all of cone s assets 
the revolving credit facility was amended on july  to extend the maturity date from august  to august   and to revise the covenants 
the present revolving credit facility commitment has been reduced to million  including letters of credit  as a result of the august   senior note payment and the sale of the corporate head quarters building 
cone may  at its option  borrow from time to time under the revolving credit agreement at a base rate or a eurodollar rate  each based on a formula set forth in the agreement

cone believes that internally generated operating cash flow and funds available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its needs for working capital and capital spending permitted under the terms of the revolving credit facility until august  when the revolving credit fa cility expires 
liquidity is predicated on cone s meeting its operating tar gets in by august  cone must either refinance or replace the re volving credit facility 
cone is in the process of exploring its alternatives related to restructuring its balance sheet and financing its business 
these alternatives may include one or more of the following completion of an exchange offer with the bonds and the entering into of an asset based lending transaction with revolver and term loan components  the restruc turing or replacing of the revolving credit facility  and funding from nontraditional sources of capital 
while management believes that it will be able to obtain the appropriate financings  including those for its mexican initiatives  given the present capital markets there is no assurance that cone will be able to replace its revolving credit facility or otherwise obtain fi nancing on terms and conditions acceptable to cone 
in connection with the restructuring of its balance sheet  on august   cone filed with the sec a registration statement relating to a proposed offering to holders of its debentures due march   to exchange its common stock for up to million of the debentures  which may be increased to million at the option of cone  and its new secured subordinated debentures and common stock for up to million of the deben tures 
in addition  the exchange includes a consent to make certain changes in the indenture governing the debentures and a release of the collateral currently securing the debentures  which require acceptance of the exchange offer by holders of more than of the debentures 
the principal pur pose of the proposed exchange offer is to enable cone to revise its debt structure in a manner that should provide more flexibility and should permit cone to obtain financing necessary for its proposed expansion into mexico 
cone expects to replace certain of its existing financing agreements with an asset based lending facility that will contain less restrictive covenants and lower interest costs 
this facility should enable cone to obtain project fi nancing for a portion of its proposed mexican expansion 
while management be lieves that it will be able to obtain the asset based facility and the mexican project financing if the exchange offer is successful  there is no assurance that cone will obtain financing on terms and conditions acceptable to cone 
on december   cone filed a second amendment to the august  filing in further response to sec comments regarding the original filing 
the regis tration statement relating to the proposed exchange offer has not yet become effective and  therefore  the exchange offer has not commenced 
on december   cone s long term capital structure consisted of million of long term debt including current maturities and million of stockholders equity 
for comparison  on january   cone had million of long term debt including current maturities and million of stockholders equity
