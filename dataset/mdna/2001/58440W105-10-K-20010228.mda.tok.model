we derive our sales from the licensing of our streaming and content creation software  from the sale of our content creation systems  from services in the form of an annual contract supporting our software and systems  and from encoding and hosting services 
in the case of software and systems  we recognize revenue upon shipment or distribution over the internet to a customer 
in the case of services that support our software and systems products  we recognize revenue ratably over the life of the service contract 
in the case of encoding and hosting services  we recognize revenue either upon delivery of the service performed or ratably over the life of the hosting contract 
our total net sales for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal net sales from products for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in net sales from products is due primarily to significantly higher sales of our streaming software  now named cleaner  sales of media press acquired as part of the wired  inc acquisition  and increased shipments of ifinish  the company s high performance windows nt based product line 
internet tools sales  which include cleaner  all the products acquired as part of the merger with digital origin  inc and all the products acquired as part of the acquisition of wired  inc  increased by to million in fiscal from in fiscal sales of digital video systems decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and  due to competitive and pricing pressures  we currently anticipate sales of these systems to continue to decline in fiscal net sales from services for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in net sales from services is due primarily to the launch of the encoding and hosting services business in june no customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal or fiscal net sales from customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company is continuing to develop its indirect distribution channels in the united states  canada  europe and asia and currently anticipates that customers outside the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net sales  and as a percentage of net sales  to remain approximately the same 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for products consists of the cost of building pci hardware boards for our content creation systems products and royalties paid to third parties for their software that has been integrated into our streaming software or our content creation systems 
cost of sales also includes the cost of manuals and other product documentation  shipping costs and related labor 
cost of sales for our service offerings consists of salaries and related expenses for service personnel delivering the service to the customer  shipping costs associated with swapping out and repairing pci hardware boards under warranty and the cost of shipping software updates to customers 
total cost of sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total cost of sales in fiscal included a number of additional charges associated with our merger with digital origin  inc and our acquisition of wired  inc additionally  subsequent to the merger  other charges to cost of sales included write offs for obsolete inventory and costs associated with the termination of several products we previously sold 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we reclassified certain costs associated with our platinum support services and we now classify these costs as part of cost of goods sold 
the change in presentation had the effect of increasing cost of goods sold and reducing selling and marketing expenses by the same amount 
overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  while gross profit as a percentage of net sales of services decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit in fiscal over fiscal for products was the result of the reduction in average selling prices of our systems products and a write off of inventory related to products that have been discontinued 
the decrease in gross profit in fiscal over fiscal for services was the result of the introduction of new services  encoding and hosting services  which carry a lower gross profit than our platinum services 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our existing intellectual property and develop new intellectual property and are charged to expense as incurred 
to date  development costs for our software and systems products have been charged to expense as incurred  because the costs incurred from the attainment of technological feasibility to general product release have not been significant 
our research and development costs may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the nature of the products under development 
some of our systems products have pci hardware included in the product and the costs associated with designing and developing this type of hardware can be expensive 
in addition  our software developers require this hardware in order to integrate the software code they develop with the hardware to create a fully integrated content creation system 
the requirement of internal use of this hardware for systems development may result in our research and development expenses fluctuating from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the majority of the increase in research and development expenses represented higher development costs associated with expanding the development of cleaner and additional engineers as a result of the wired  inc acquisition in december the company currently anticipates that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal versus fiscal due to the continued development of our existing products and additional products currently under development  some of which we currently believe will ship in fiscal and selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  travel  commissions and marketing costs such as advertising  trade shows  marketing materials  lead generation activities and public relations 
our selling and marketing expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and sales commissions  which vary based on sales 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from increased sales of cleaner  ifinish and wired products 
we currently anticipate that our selling and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat in absolute dollars in fiscal versus fiscal as we maintain our focus on the internet and traditional broadcasters 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  travel and outside services for human resources  finance  information technology  legal  and other administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from increased personnel costs in support of higher net sales and increased costs due to the merger with digital origin and the acquisitions of wired  st century and j we currently anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal as we begin to realize expense efficiencies as a result of our streamlining initiatives of the general and administrative functions  which occurred late in fiscal amortization of intangible assets 
we recorded expense for the amortization of intangible assets of  in fiscal related to the acquisitions of terran  wired  st century  j and certain assets of integrated computing engines  inc in fiscal  we recorded amortization expense of  related to the acquisition of terran 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of wired  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
in fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of terran  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
both of allocations represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition of each company  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
restructuring expense 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our organization with our corporate strategy and to reflect the consolidation of several companies we acquired in the past fiscal year 
we recorded  of restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal the major components of the restructuring charge relate to the write off of certain assets no longer required to run the operations of the company and the termination of employment of personnel across all functions 
at november   approximately  of the accrued restructuring charge remained to be paid  primarily composed of severance related costs associated with the termination of employment of personnel 
the total cash impact of the restructuring amounted to approximately  in fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to focus ourselves on a new market opportunity  streaming media  created as a result of our acquisition of terran 
we recorded  of restructuring expense in the third quarter of fiscal the major component of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of employment of personnel in the research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative functions 
at november   approximately  of the  restructuring charge remained to be paid  composed entirely of severance related costs 
the total cash paid as of november  was  and the remaining  was paid in the first quarter of fiscal merger related costs 
in fiscal  we recorded  of merger related costs associated with our merger with digital origin in the second quarter of fiscal these costs include the use of external professional services including legal  accounting and investment banking to assist in the negotiation and closing of the transaction 
there was no such expense recorded in fiscal interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest income expense  net  resulted from lower cash and cash equivalents due primarily to the net loss incurred in fiscal and the use of cash for the acquisitions of terran  wired  st century  j and substantially all of the assets of ice and the merger with digital origin 
we currently anticipate that interest income will decline in fiscal versus due to a reduction in our average cash balance throughout fiscal compared with fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was an expense of million for fiscal compared to income of million for fiscal the expense for fiscal was primarily due to foreign currency transactions losses related to our four european subsidiaries 
for fiscal  other income of million included million from the korea data systems america  inc kds license as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  million from the sale of the color server group and other assets to splash technology holdings  inc splash  and million in miscellaneous other income 
tax provision benefit 
we did not require a tax provision in fiscal or fiscal due to the net loss recorded in fiscal and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits available to the company to offset against other income in fiscal net income loss 
as a result of the above factors  we recorded a net loss in fiscal in the amount of  or per share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share  in fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales 
our total net sales for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal net sales from products for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in net sales from products was due primarily to the shipment of ifinish previously called finish  the company s high performance windows nt based product line  along with internet tools sales from our wholly owned subsidiaries terran interactive and digital origin 
we completed the acquisition of terran interactive  inc  terran a leading developer of streaming media tools for preparing high quality video for broadcast on the internet in june internet tools sales increased to million in fiscal from in fiscal during  sales of previously introduced software products for digital video camcorders including photodv  motodv  and editdv increased over fiscal in addition during  digital origin introduced several new products including editdv for windows  motodv studio  motodv mobile  rotodv  rotoweb and introdv 
localized versions of several of the products were introduced to the european and japanese markets contributing to growth in international software revenues 
no customer accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal one customer accounted for of net sales in net sales from services for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in net sales from services was due to new customers purchasing and existing customers renewing their support contracts 
net sales from customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we reclassified certain costs associated with our platinum support services 
we now classify these costs as part of cost of goods sold 
the change in presentation had the effect of increasing cost of goods sold and reducing selling and marketing expenses by the same amount 
certain amounts in the comparable period of have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of products increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  while gross profit as a percentage of net sales of services increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal over fiscal was a result of increased sales of software products  which provide higher gross profit  and the discontinuation of lower margin monitor and graphics product lines 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the majority of the decrease in research and development expenses represented lower development costs due to the completion of ifinish  the company s high performance windows nt based product line  which began shipping in the first quarter of fiscal and headcount reductions resulting from digital origin s departure from the monitor and graphics business 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  travel  commissions  and marketing costs such as advertising  trade shows  marketing materials  lead generation activities and public relations 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of terran and our promotion of the streaming media tools acquired as part of the transaction 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  travel and outside services for human resources  finance  information technology  legal and other administrative functions 
the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from increased personnel costs in support of higher net sales 
amortization of intangible assets 
we recorded an expense for the amortization of intangible assets of  in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of terran 
there was no similar expense recorded in fiscal acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of terran  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
restructuring expense 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to focus ourselves on a new market opportunity  streaming media  created as a result of our acquisition of terran 
we recorded  of restructuring expense in the third quarter of fiscal the major component of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of employment of personnel in the research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative functions 
at november   approximately  of the  restructuring charge remained to be paid  comprised of severance related costs 
the total cash paid as of november  was  and the remaining  was paid in the first quarter of fiscal interest income expenses  net 
interest income expense  net  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest income expense  net  results from lower interest expense due primarily to lower average borrowings as a result of the repayment of the working capital line of credit 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the other income for fiscal includes million from the korea data systems america  inc kds license as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  million from the sale of the color server group and other assets to splash technology holdings  inc splash  and million in miscellaneous other income 
fiscal included million related to the kds license  million from the sale of splash common stock  million from the sale of umax common stock and million in miscellaneous other income 
tax provision benefit 
we did not require a tax provision in fiscal due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits available to the company to offset against operating income 
for fiscal  we reversed an accrual for income taxes of million 
the reversal reflects the fact that exposure in certain foreign jurisdictions  as a result of our closure of a foreign subsidiary  had become remote 
net income loss 
as a result of the above factors  we recorded net income in fiscal in the amount of  or per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per share  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date primarily from public offerings of equity securities and cash flows from operations 
as of november   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately  this was a decrease of approximately  from the  of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we had as of november  during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was approximately  compared to cash used in operating activities of approximately  for the same period a year ago 
cash used in operations during fiscal included a net loss of  including depreciation and amortization of  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of  non cash restructuring and other charges of  acquired in process research and development expense of  non cash interest and other expense of  a loss on the sale of marketable securities of  and a gain on the disposition of fixed assets of  in addition  cash used in operations was affected by changes in asset and liabilities including increases in accounts receivables of  inventories of  and reductions in accrued expenses of  offset by increases in accounts payable of  and deferred revenue of  and prepaid expenses and other current assets of  net cash provided by investing activities was approximately  in fiscal compared to approximately  for the same period a year ago 
cash provided by investing activities during was derived from the proceeds of sales of marketable securities  net of purchases of approximately  this was offset by approximately  related to the acquisition of terran   related to the acquisition of certain assets of ice   related to the acquisition of wired   related to the acquisition of st century  and  related to the acquisition of j in addition  cash provided by investing activities was affected by  for capital expenditures for equipment  an increase in other assets of  and an increase in intangible assets of  cash provided by financing activities during was approximately  compared to cash used in financing activities of  for the same period a year ago 
in  cash provided by financing activities was proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock plans 
cash was also affected by a net decrease in cash related to the digital origin  inc pre merger period of  we currently anticipate that our current cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional funds  however  in order to fund expansion of our business  develop new and enhance existing products and services  or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership or our stockholders may be reduced  our stockholders may experience additional dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or develop or enhance our products or services would be significantly limited 
cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following cautionary statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks were to occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would decline 
merger and acquisition related risks 
during fiscal year ended november   we completed the merger with digital origin and the acquisitions of wired  st century  and j in addition  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of ice 
our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the event we fail to complete publicly announced acquisitions or to successfully integrate the business and operations of the merger or the acquisitions 
in the future  we may continue to acquire or merge with existing businesses  products  and technologies to enhance and expand our line of products 
such mergers and acquisitions may be material in size and in scope 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  acquire  or profitably manage additional business or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our business without substantial expenses  delays  or other operational or financial problems 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and factors  including increasing competition for attractive acquisition candidates in our markets  the technological enhancement and incorporation of acquired products into existing product lines and services  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  failure to retain key acquired personnel  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the assumption of undisclosed liabilities of any acquired companies  the failure to achieve anticipated benefits such as cost savings and synergies  as well as the diversion of management s attention during the acquisition and integration process 
some or all of these special risks and factors may have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition and  as a result  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
significant fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict  have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future for a number of reasons  including new product announcements and introductions by ourselves or our competitors  changes in pricing  and the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter 
also  in the past  we have experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancements  and such delays may occur in the future 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
additionally  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed  and operating expense levels are based primarily on internal expectations of future revenue 
as a consequence  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if quarterly revenue or earnings levels fail to meet internal or external expectations  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
emerging markets 
the markets in which we offer our software and systems products and services are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we are targeting the emerging market of new internet based broadcasters that are building streaming media web sites and businesses and institutions that are adding internet video to their web sites 
this market and the products utilized by these users are relatively new 
our success in this emerging market will depend on the rate at which the market develops and our ability to penetrate that market 
we will not succeed if we cannot compete effectively in this market and  as a result  our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with development and introduction of new products 
if we are not successful in developing and introducing new products to the markets we serve our business and operating results will suffer 
in addition  new product announcements by our competitors and by us could have the effect of reducing customer demand for our existing products 
also  when we introduce new or enhanced products we must effectively manage the transitions from existing products to minimize disruption of orders from our customers 
new product introductions require us to devote time and resources to the training of our sales channel in the features and target customers for such new products  which efforts could result in less selling efforts being made by the sales channel during such training period 
our failure to effectively manage new product announcements or introductions could contribute to significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline and  as a result  our operating results will suffer 
rapid technological change 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products and features in a timely manner to address customer requirements  respond to competitive offerings  adapt to new emerging industry standards and take advantage of new enabling technologies that could render our existing products obsolete 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development  in connection with our development strategy 
any delay or failure on our part in developing additional new products or features for existing products or any failure of such new products or features to achieve market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and our stock price will suffer 
competition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features and accelerate the release of new products 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with our products  including accom  inc  anystream  inc  adobe systems inc  apple computer inc  avid technology  inc  discreet a division of autodesk  inc  fast electronic gmbh  loudeye technologies  inc  matrix electronic systems ltd  pinnacle systems  inc  real networks inc  and sonic foundry  inc 
in addition  we expect much larger vendors  such as matsushita electric industrial company ltd  microsoft corporation  and sony corporation  to develop and introduce digital editing systems that may compete with our products 
many of these current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us  including  without limitation  larger and more established selling and marketing capabilities  greater brand recognition and a larger installed base of customers  and well established relationships with our existing and potential customers  complementary technology vendors and other business partners 
as a result  our competitors may be able to develop products comparable to or superior to our own products  adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry standards or customer requirements  or lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which we could not operate profitably  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in this regard  we believe that it will continue to experience competitive pressure to reduce prices  particularly for our high data rate systems 
we have historically realized higher gross profit on the sale of these high data rate systems  and such continued competitive pricing pressure could result in lower sales and gross margin  which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on and competition with apple computer  inc 
as a competitor  apple computer  inc apple could  in the future  inhibits our ability to develop our products that operate on the macintosh platform 
additionally  new products and enhancements to existing products from apple such as final cut pro could cause customers to delay purchases of our products or alter their purchase decision altogether 
furthermore  as the sole supplier of macintosh computers  any disruption in the availability of these computers could cause customers to defer or alter their purchase of our products 
we rely on access to key information from apple to continue development of our products and any failure to continue supplying our engineers with this information could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on microsoft corporation 
many of our products operate in the windows environment and our engineers depend upon access to information in advance from microsoft corporation microsoft 
any failure to continue supplying our engineers with this information could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on single or limited source suppliers 
the company is dependent on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in its products that have no ready substitutes  including various audio and video signal processing integrated circuits manufactured in each case only by crystal semiconductor corp  raytheon company  lsi logic corp  philips semiconductors or zoran corp 
the availability of many of these components is dependent on our ability to provide suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements  and certain components we use to build our products have been subject to industry wide shortages 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
there can be no assurance that our inventory levels will be adequate to meet production needs during any interruption of supply 
our inability to develop alternative supply sources  if required  or a reduction or stoppage in supply  could delay product shipments until new sources of supply become available  and any such delay could adversely affect our business and operating results in any given period and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on propriety technology 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
previously  we have received  and may in the future continue to receive  communications suggesting that our products may infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
our policy is to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products  or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that these or other future communications can be settled on commercially reasonable terms or that they will not result in protracted and costly litigation 
any failure to secure the necessary intellectual property right of third parties on commercially reasonable terms may adversely affect our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
risks of third party claims of infringement 
there has been substantial industry litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us or to enforce trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by us  to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
for a description of certain pending litigation instituted against the company  see item  legal proceedings and note b to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
any such litigation could be costly and a diversion of management s attention  which could adversely affect our business and operating results and our financial condition 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results and our financial condition 
dependence on distributors and resellers 
we rely primarily on our worldwide network of independent distributors and vars to distribute and sell our products to end users 
our distributors and resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including in some cases products that are competitive with our own products 
in addition  many of the vars are small organizations with limited capital resources 
there can be no assurance that our distributors and resellers will continue to purchase products from us  or that our efforts to expand our network of distributors and resellers will be successful 
any significant failure on our part to maintain or expand our network or distributors and resellers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
reliance on international sales 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  less effective enforcement of proprietary rights  currency exchange fluctuations  generally longer collection periods  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potential insolvency of international resellers and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
our international sales are also subject to more seasonal fluctuation than domestic sales 
in this regard  the traditional summer vacation period  which occurs during our third fiscal quarter  may result in a decrease in sales  particularly in europe 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect on our future international operations and consequently  on our business and operating results 
this fluctuation may be material and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
internet based sales 
in the second half of fiscal  we implemented e commerce systems allowing customers to purchase our products directly from one of our web sites 
since implementation of the e commerce system  our sales through this channel have increased as a percentage of our total sales 
there can be no assurances that our customers will continue to purchase our products from one of our web sites or that these web sites will not experience technical difficulties thereby causing customers to delay purchases 
any significant technical difficulties could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on key personnel 
competition for employees with the skills required by us is intense in the geographic areas in which we maintain physical operations 
we believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees  especially in research and development 
any significant delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
history of losses 
we have incurred substantial operating losses in each of the past five fiscal years 
we incurred operating losses of approximately million  million  million  million and million for fiscal    and  respectively 
as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
over the past three years we have significantly increased our research and development expenses as a percentage of total sales and we plan to continue to invest in new technology  and as a result  we may incur operating losses in future periods 
we will need to generate increases in our current sales levels to achieve profitability and we may not be able to do so 
if our sales grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenue  our business will be significantly and adversely affected 
our failure to achieve profitability or achieve the level of profitability expected by investors and securities analysts may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
stock price volatility 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
during fiscal  our stock price fluctuated between a low of per share and a high of per share 
we believe that the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of events and factors relating to our company  our competitors  and the market for our products and services  many of which are beyond our control  such as  variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of companies in our markets  announcements by us or our competitors of significant products  acquisitions  or strategic partnerships  failure to complete significant business transactions  departures of key personnel  purchases or sales of common stock or other securities by us  or news relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility over the past twelve months 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance
