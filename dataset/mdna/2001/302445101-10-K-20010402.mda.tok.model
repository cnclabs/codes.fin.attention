overview flir systems was founded in and has become a world leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of commercial  industrial and government applications 
our business is organized around two principal markets  imaging and thermography 
through the acquisition of agema infrared systems ab  headquartered in danderyd  sweden  in and the pooling of interest merger with inframetrics  inc  headquartered in n 
billerica  massachusetts  in  the company has experienced significant change in its structure and operations 
in the thermography market where each of the three previously separate companies competed  there was a significant transition as the company phased out products utilizing cooled technology and focused on the uncooled products that are produced in sweden 
in the imaging market  the merger with inframetrics brought a certain set of complimentary products to the previous portfolio of products carried by the company 
we continue to enhance our state of the art products within both markets  as well as develop products for new market applications that use advanced thermal imaging technologies 
uncooled detector technology operates at room temperature  allowing for systems that are less expensive  smaller  lighter  and more energy efficient 
additionally  we have developed higher margin image analysis software tools that enhance the capability of our thermography products 
as hardware prices decline  the sophistication of image analysis software and the incremental functionality provided by such analysis tools are expected to become a more critical component of thermography systems 
during the course of  the company  under new management  has been restructuring its operations to improve profitability 
as a result  in  the company recorded charges totaling million primarily associated with realigning its operations to focus on higher margin products  eliminating aged or lower margin products  improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing production and distribution costs 
these charges include million to cost of goods sold to adjust inventory reserves related to certain low margin products and older products being phased out 
in addition  million related to cost accumulation and asset valuations have been written off as a result of these operational changes  million was incurred associated with workforce reductions and related costs  and million was recorded related to the settlement of the class action lawsuit 
international revenue accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenue 
with the production and distribution of our thermography products in sweden contributing a significant volume of sales denominated in foreign currencies  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
the company typically experiences longer payment cycles on its international sales  which can have an adverse impact upon the company s liquidity 
in addition  substantial portions of the company s operations are conducted outside the united states  particularly in sweden 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and general economic conditions 
the company experiences fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variances and customer sales cycles  such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement by international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of december due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
restatements and reclassifications in march  the company determined that it was necessary to restate its and consolidated financial statements and its interim and consolidated financial statements 
the restatements were effected after the company determined  based on a review of the specific terms and conditions underlying certain sales transactions recorded in and  that revenue was recognized with respect to such transactions during periods or in amounts that were not consistent with the company s revenue recognition policy 
accordingly  the restatements include the deferral of revenue from the reporting period in which the revenue was originally recorded to the reporting period in which the revenue would be properly recorded under the company s revenue recognition policy 
the related cost of sales and certain operating costs have also been restated as appropriate 
the restatements also include a revision in the accounting for certain assets recorded in connection with the merger with inframetrics  inc in as a result of the restatements  previously reported revenue for the year ended december  was reduced by million  previously reported revenue for the year ended december  was increased by million  and revenue for the year ended december  was increased by million 
as a result of the restatements  the previously reported net earnings for the year ended december  was reduced by million  the previously reported net loss for the year ended december  was reduced by million  and the net loss for the year ended december  was reduced by million 
there have also been reclassifications made in and to report results on a consistent basis with that of these reclassifications had no impact on net earnings for the years presented

years ended december   and revenue 
revenue increased from million in to million in the increase was due to higher volumes in the imaging business as revenue in that business segment increased from million in to million in the increase in imaging revenue was experienced across most of the product segments 
revenue for thermography in and amounted to million and million  respectively 
revenue for thermography remained relatively constant  as revenue from an increase in units delivered was offset by approximately million associated with the decline in the value of foreign currencies to the us dollar during the revenue period 
revenue in was million compared to revenue in of million 
in  revenue from the imaging business increased by million  or  while revenue from the thermography business decreased by million  or 
the increase in imaging revenue was due to increased demand in both the governmental and commercial market segments 
the decrease in thermography revenue was primarily due to the loss of market share as a result of the consolidation of the business base after the acquisition of agema and the merger with inframetrics 
the loss of market share resulted from the company s focus on the consolidation of operations and distribution channels  the elimination of duplicative or overlapping product lines and the reaction of the market to those changes 
international revenue in was million  representing of revenue 
this compared to international revenue of million  or of revenue  and international revenue of million  or of revenue 
gross profit 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit in was compared to in one time charges of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
without these one time charges  gross profit would have been in and in this improvement in margin is partially attributable to the decrease in manufacturing costs that has resulted from the streamlining of operations that took place in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit in was compared to in  excluding the impacts of the one time charges recorded in that year 
the gross profit in was negatively impacted by excess manufacturing costs  partially as a result of the merger and before certain consolidation activities occurred 
research and development 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense decreased slightly to in  from in research and development expense for included million related to cost accumulations and asset valuations that have been written off as a result of operational changes and charges totaling million associated with workforce reductions and related costs

selling and other operating costs 
selling and other operating costs increased  from million in to million in the increase in selling and other operating costs were due to one time charges in of million principally related to workforce reductions  the settlement of the class action lawsuit and write offs of demonstration equipment  as well as additional legal and audit fees incurred during  partially offset by cost savings generated in as a result of streamlining activities initiated during the year 
as a percentage of revenue  selling and other operating costs were and in and  respectively 
without these one time charges  selling and other operating costs would have been million or of revenue in selling and other operating costs increased in from million in to million in the million increase in selling and other operating costs in in absolute dollar terms was due to a variety of factors including expense increases due to anticipated higher volumes of business that were not fully realized  implementation costs for an enterprise resource planning system  higher commission expense  increased bad debt expense and higher costs from our uk operations 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the increase in expense was primarily due to increased debt levels and increased interest rates 
the increased interest rates were due to the application of default rates for most of under the company s credit agreement resulting in the average borrowing rate of at december  increasing to a rate of as of december  the increase in expense was also due to the fair value adjustment of million on the interest rate swap agreements 
income taxes 
the company s income tax provision was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the mix in taxable income or loss between the company s us and foreign operations in each of these years significantly impacted the recording of the tax provision 
the tax provisions in and primarily reflect taxes provided on income generated in the company s foreign subsidiaries  principally sweden 
the substantial losses generated in the united states  however  have not been benefited in those years due to inability to carry such losses back to prior years and valuation allowances recorded against the resulting deferred tax assets 
at december   the company had us and united kingdom tax net operating loss carryforwards nols totaling approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through additionally  the company has various us tax credits available aggregating million that expire in the years through the company also has a million deferred tax asset related to acquired in process research and development recorded in connection with the agema acquisition 
the realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the ability of foreign subsidiaries to remit earnings to the us parent 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  management has recorded a substantial valuation allowance amounting to million against such deferred tax assets 
management believes  primarily as a result of the significant operational restructuring in the third quarter of  that the net deferred tax asset of million reflected on the december  consolidated balance sheet  is realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income 
in addition  the company is planning to implement various tax planning strategies to assist in the utilization of such deferred tax assets 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including but not limited to continued growth of the thermography and imaging markets  competitive pressures on sales and gross margins  successful implementation of tax planning strategies  and other factors beyond the company s control 
no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the unreserved deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in future periods if its future forecasts of taxable income and or tax planning strategies are not achieved 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had short term borrowings net of cash on hand of million compared to million at december  the decrease in short term borrowings during the year was principally due to the reclassification of million to long term debt as a result of an amendment to the company s credit agreement in january cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to net cash used by operating activities in of million 
cash provided by operating activities was principally due to reductions in accounts receivable and inventories offset by the net loss for the year  net of non cash charges  and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
at december   the company had accounts receivable in the amount of million compared to million at december  the company has increased its collection efforts and tightened its credit policies 
days sales outstanding decreased from at december  to at december  the timing of sales  particularly the recording of large system sales  can significantly impact the calculation of days sales outstanding at any point in time 
at december   the company had inventories on hand of million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to inventory reduction initiatives and write offs of certain inventories in connection with restructuring our operations in the company had accounts payable of million at december   compared to a balance of million on december  the decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to the lower operating expenses and inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of compared to earlier periods and to the increase in the availability of cash to settle trade accounts

at december   the interest rate under the amended credit agreement was the amended credit agreement provides that the maximum borrowing facility will be permanently reduced by of the first million of principal payment and at which time the financing availability will be fixed at an amount not to exceed million 
principal payments exceeding million will permanently reduce the maximum borrowing facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
the interest rate on the borrowings under the amended credit agreement as of december  and january  was the prime rate of the primary lender for domestic borrowings plus 
the interest rate on borrowings decline as certain principal payments are made 
a reduction of basis points is provided after the payment of million and an additional basis point reduction after each million principal reduction thereafter  subject to a total reduction of basis points

this credit line is secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of the subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis 
we believe that our existing cash  cash generated by operating activities  available credit facilities and financing available from other sources  combined with our continuing efforts to control costs  to improve the collections of accounts receivable and better manage our inventory levels will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
at the present  we do not have any significant capital commitments for the coming year
