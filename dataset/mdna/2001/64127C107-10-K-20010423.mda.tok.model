non consolidated amount msi s msi s joint venture joint venture equity included in non jv consolidated sales net income msi msi revenue revenue revenue vs 
revenues increased from million in to million in as net sales increased million for the period  resulting primarily from an increase in the revenues of tbs and gme of million and million  respectively 
however  the loss from operations increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as operating performance weakened by million for the same period and as the company recognized an estimated impairment of its explosives business assets of million in connection with the proposed transaction with uee  which represented a million increase from the million impairment the company recognized during the year ended december  on its joint ventures in ghana and uzbekistan 
the increase in tbs revenues of million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is reflective of the consolidation of a full year of operating results at tbs in versus the four month start up period consolidated in while tbs was able to achieve its revenue goals  difficulties in managing its costs resulted in a net loss to the company s consolidated operating results of million  including general and administrative expenses attributable to tbs 
management does not expect improvement in tbs s performance until organizational changes made in the first quarter of have sufficient time to take effect  concurrent with tbs s emergence from the traditional winter low point of the construction industry s yearly cycle 
the million or increase in the revenues of gme for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily the result of increased market penetration 
the company s canadian operation increased revenues nearly  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as its primary customer increased production 
after adding the general and administrative expenses of tbs and gme to total cost of sales for the respective years  gross margin on net sales and royalties decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the million decrease consists primarily of the million increase in the loss from tbs when comparing to additionally  the contribution from royalties decreased approximately  or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increasing competition in the bulk explosives market in the western us has added pressure to already small margins resulting in a  decrease in contribution from the company s western us division for the year ended december  as compared the same period in this decrease in contribution for the period was essentially offset by the combined increase in contribution from gme and from the company s eastern us and canadian divisions 
for the year ended december  as compared to the prior period  the increase in equity in earnings from cms and ems of  and  respectively  combined with a decrease in the equity loss from wac of  was not enough to offset the decrease in equity in earnings from cyanco of  resulting in a net decrease in equity in earnings for the period of  the general and administrative expenses of the company increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   for an increase of million 
in analyzing the gross margin results of the company s explosives operating units  the general and administrative expenses of gme and tbs were considered components of the direct contribution from those operating units 
however  for purposes of financial statement disclosure  general and administrative expenses for the company include the general and administrative expenses of gme and tbs 
the million of general and administrative expenses of gme for the year ended december  remained relatively static  increasing or  as compared to however  the general and administrative expenses of tbs increased million from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in the general and administrative expenses of tbs during the period is primarily attributable to the consolidation of a full year of tbs operating results as compared to the four months consolidated in however  the million increase also includes  of bad debt expense reflecting the inability of tbs to fully manage its dramatic growth during the year ended december  excluding the results of tbs and gme  general and administrative expenses increased  during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
approximately  of the increase is attributable to increased professional fees and travel expenses related to the uee transaction 
an increase in fees paid to the company s board of directors accounted for  of the increase 
additionally  bad debt expense unrelated to tbs increased  over the prior period 
other expenses  which consist primarily of interest expense  increased  or during the year ended december  as compared to the year the ended december  as a result of increased borrowings to fund the cash operating losses of the company 
the company recognized a benefit for income taxes of million with an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  compared to a benefit of  and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the difference between the statutory rate and the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the recognition of the difference between the book and tax basis of assets expected to be sold in the transaction with uee 
vs consolidated revenues increased in by only  however  the slight change included a million or increase in net sales offset by a million or decrease in equity earnings of joint ventures 
the increase in net sales consisted primarily of an increase in sales from gme of million and tbs of million  largely offset by a decrease in the sales of the company s remaining us  canadian and foreign joint venture explosives operations of million 
most of the million decrease in equity earnings of joint ventures was attributable to a decrease in cyanco s earnings  with the remainder of the decrease resulting from the decrease in equity in the earnings of turon msi and cayman mining services limited cms 
expectations of increased net sales in were realized with the acquisition of gme and subsequently the establishment of tbs 
however  the company s plans to offset the expected loss of revenues from the completed dam project in california were delayed until several new projects in the company s western division were brought on line in the first half of cyanco s contribution to equity in earnings of joint ventures decreased as volumes and prices for sodium cyanide fell in in response to the lowest gold prices in years 
because of gold market conditions  the company was able to negotiate the elimination of deferred royalty obligations it had with respect to its interest in cyanco resulting in an extraordinary gain for the company of million  net of taxes 
the loss from operations for the year ended december  of million represents a million decrease from the million income from operations experienced during the same period in the million decrease is attributable to the decrease in equity in earnings of cyanco as explained above  combined with a net decrease in contribution from the company s explosives operations of million  and the recognition of an impairment of assets of million 
as a result of the completion of the dam project in california in the early part of  combined with decreased coal production by customers in canada and colombia  contribution from the company s western us and canadian explosives divisions and the company s colombian joint venture decreased by a total of million when comparing to the inability of the company s joint venture in uzbekistan to purchase raw materials resulted in a decrease in production 
consequently  contribution from turon msi decreased  in as compared to in analyzing the results of the company s explosives operating units above  the general and administrative expenses of gme and tbs were considered components of the direct contribution from those operating units 
however  for purposes of financial statement disclosure  general and administrative expenses for the company include the general and administrative expenses of gme and tbs  which represent million of the million increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to although intensified effort toward product improvement contributed to the increase in research and development costs  the establishment of a more resilient packaged emulsion product allowed the company to reduce losses from its west virginia plant by approximately  and strengthened expectations of realizing long term benefit from the research through increased revenues from packaged emulsions in  the impairment of assets represents a write off of million of the company s investments in west africa chemicals limited wac and turon msi of  and million  respectively  including a  note receivable from wac 
although the company expects to receive payment for raw materials and supplies it sells to its joint venture in uzbekistan  due to deteriorating conditions observed in the later part of the company considered the probability of converting profits from turon msi into hard currency to be remote 
additionally  depressed gold prices and an oversupply of explosives products in ghana have deterred wac in obtaining market share sufficient to sustain profitable operations in the long term and have combined to cause continuing losses 
accordingly  the company determined in the last quarter of that it was necessary to write off the respective investments 
future recognition of income or loss from these equity method joint ventures will occur as cash is either received or disbursed 

the company incurred interest expense of  versus  of interest income that the company earned in liquidity and financial resources the company s current ratio decreased from to as of december  to to as of december  current assets increased million as of december  compared to december  as nci retained a million distribution it had received from cyanco  taking an initial step toward a potential future separation between the explosives business and the cyanide business  and as net accounts receivable increased million or 
inventories also increased  during the period 
the increase in net accounts receivable was principally due to the recognition by the company of an income tax receivable of million resulting from the and net operating losses  as well as the change to full scale operations at tbs by december  versus start up operations existing at december  additionally  accounts receivable from cms decreased approximately  as the company was reimbursed for expenditures it had made to procure equipment leased by ems from mcr  and as payments were received from turon msi for previous raw material shipments decreasing accounts receivable by  accounts receivable due from ems increased  current liabilities increased just over million from million as of december  to million as of december  million of the increase was created as the company delayed certain payments and  again  as tbs moved from start up operations during the last quarter of to full scale operations by the end of current liabilities were also affected by the increase in the current portion of long term debt 
in september  the company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement loc that expires in august it had been the company s expectation to extend the loc at the end of the third quarter to mature in august however  due to the company s marginal performance in the later part of and during  the company will likely convert this commercial bank borrowing to an asset based borrowing in advance of the loc s august maturity 
management believes that the bank will agree to the refinancing 
however  because the company was not able to extend the loc  the entire balance of the loan has been reclassified as a current liability 
the company had million owing on its loc as of december  the company had utilized up to million of its loc during the year ended december  due to conditions of default existing as of september and december   the bank increased the loc rate of interest from prime minus to prime plus 
the reclassification of the current portion of long term debt  as well as the company s poor operating performance during  have resulted in technical defaults under the credit agreement 
management believes that the bank will be willing to continue the financing relationship and waive the default 
the company is currently in negotiations with the bank regarding the refinancing and a decision by the bank was not available at the time of filing this report  however  there is no assurance that the refinancing will be approved by the bank 
the increase in the use of the company s borrowing capacity has been the result of poor operating performance  particularly at tbs 
rapid growth at tbs resulted in the recognition that over  of its accounts would not likely be collected 
accordingly  tbs wrote off  of accounts receivable against bad debt expense and reserved an additional  in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
even though changes to the organization and the capitalization of the joint venture are currently being negotiated and management expects tbs s performance to improve during the second quarter of  the losses sustained by tbs during the first quarter along with the untimely collection on some of its accounts have left the future of the joint venture uncertain if the company elects not to fund tbs s excess cash flow requirements 
reserves established against the company s investment in tbs in connection with the company s recognition of impairment against its explosives assets are deemed by management to be adequate 
although the company experienced a loss of million during  much of the loss is the consequence of the establishment of non cash reserves  accordingly  the company recognized net cash provided by operating activities of million 
the company increased its loans to cms in the amount of  to fund operating growth during the year ended december  additionally  the company made capital equipment acquisitions of million during the year  including  of accessories production equipment at oda   of equipment related to the company s joint venture in russia   for the improvement of a magazine site at gme  and the purchase of drills at tbs for approximately  certain future expectations for the company are materially dependent on whether the company can implement its business plan to sell the explosives operations to uee and utilize the proceeds in developing its other lines of business 
the sale of the explosives business to uee is subject to a number of conditions  including approval by the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance it will be completed 
in the event that the uee transaction is not completed and other possible transactions to sell the explosives business can not be achieved  the company s current capital structure may need to be revised to provide for the anticipated growth requirements for both the explosives and the cyanide lines of products or the company may be in the position of curtailing certain business activities in order to properly support the long term growth of the company 
inflation and other comments the amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on the company s operations or its financial position 
amounts shown for property  plant and equipment and for costs and expenses reflect historical cost and do not necessarily represent replacement cost or charges to operations based on replacement cost 
the company s operations  together with other sources  are intended to provide funds to replace property  plant and equipment as necessary 
net income would be lower than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments 
because of inflation associated with the economies of underdeveloped countries where the company invests  there exists a substantial risk that the value of investments in those jurisdictions may continue to erode 
additionally  as has been the case with the company s investment in uzbekistan  the internal balance of payment and capital shortages in some of those countries may limit the ability to convert local currencies into hard currency necessary for importing raw materials or remitting profits 
management intends to use appropriate transfer pricing  investments in hedges  loans and other credit facilities where practical and available to minimize the risks inherent in doing business in these countries 
the company continues to pursue its policy of investing with government entities or stable international and us companies as its partners to help insure its long term success 
to date  the company has not utilized any hedging activities to minimize exchange risks 
within this annual report filed on form k  including this item  there are forward looking statements made in an effort to inform the reader of management s expectations of future events 
these expectations are subject to numerous factors and assumptions  any one of which  could have a material effect on current expectations 
these factors which may impact future results include  but are not limited to  changes in world supply and demand for commodities  particularly gold and coal  political  environmental  economic and financial risks  especially those associated with underdeveloped and developing countries  changes in demand for construction activities  major changes in technology which could affect the mining industry as a whole or which could affect explosives and sodium cyanide specifically  competition  the continued availability of highly qualified technical and other professional employees of the company who can successfully manage the ongoing change and growth 
the company believes it is taking appropriate actions in order to address these and other factors previously disclosed  however  the actual results could materially differ from those indicated in the statements made 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency and interest rates 
the company manufactures and sells some of its products in colombia  ghana  uzbekistan and canada 
it also purchases products for raw materials and for resale from additional foreign markets such as australia and india 
in addition  the company licenses its technology in other foreign countries such as south africa  india  korea  and namibia 
approximately of the company s consolidated revenue is generated from foreign markets  however  as explained in the management s discussion and analysis of operation  the company s sales in joint ventures are not reported in consolidated revenues and the percentage of the company s business in foreign countries will likely remain significant 
the company manages its risk of foreign currency rate changes by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which it regularly transacts business and by maintaining hard currency accounts to which dollar denominated contracts are credited 
most of the sales and purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars except in ghana and uzbekistan where the investments have now been written off 
none of the license royalty payment obligations are denominated in us dollars and are thus subject to the risks of currency rate changes 
all excess cash balances are immediately transferred to us dollar accounts to the extent possible 
option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions are not used by the company 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading in speculative purposes 
changes in the currency rate are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations currently 
sales contracts related to the company s joint venture in russia are paid in local currency  though pegged to a dollar denominated price 
although the amounts recognized for are not material to the company s financial statements  it is likely that sales receipts and leasing contract receipts may be subject to significant time delay in converting them from local currency to us dollars 
accordingly  equity in earnings from that joint venture may be subjected to more currency exchange risk than is experienced by the company in other foreign joint ventures 
it is not expected that currency rate hedging transactions will be used in the company s cash equivalents and short term investments and its outstanding debt bear variable interest rates 
the rates are adjusted to market conditions 
changes in the market rate affects interest earned and paid by the company 
the company does not use derivative instruments to offset the exposure to changes in interest rates 
changes in the interest rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations
