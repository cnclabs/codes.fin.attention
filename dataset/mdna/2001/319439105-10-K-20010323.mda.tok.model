the changes in net interest income from year to year are analyzed in table four 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
for the year ended december   net interest income amounted to million  an increase of approximately percent from net interest income of million in this was attributable to an increase in average interest earning assets of million to billion for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the growth in the corporation s average loan portfolio  which increased million 
the increase in average yield on interest earning assets to percent during  compared to percent during  resulted principally from the increase in the average prime rate during  from percent in to percent in the average yield earned on loans was percent in  compared to percent in in addition to the increase in average interest earning assets  the corporation experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million  or percent from the prior year  due to the use of fhlb advances and increases in deposits to fund loan growth 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased during the period to percent in  compared to percent in  due to a shift in the deposit mix and higher rates on fhlb advances 
the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was percent in  up from percent in similarly  the rate paid on other borrowed funds increased to percent in  compared to percent in the net interest margin tax adjusted net interest income divided by average interest earning assets decreased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in this reflects the impact of higher levels of borrowings and competitive forces related to loan and deposit pricing

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses in amounted to million compared to the provision for loan losses of million in the increase in the provision over prior year levels was due to i loan growth  primarily in the commercial portfolio  ii increases in net charge offs  and iii increases in nonperforming assets

the increase was primarily due to increases in service charge income resulting from applying fcnb s service charge rates to carolina first deposit accounts subsequent to the merger  as well as continued growth of first charter insurance services 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million compared to million for the same period in excluding the non core items noted in table two on page  core operating noninterest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the same period in this decrease was primarily the result of synergies realized as a result of the carolina first merger

this compares to a composition of percent commercial  financial and agricultural  percent real estate construction  percent real estate mortgage  and percent installment at december  approximately million of the real estate mortgage loans at december  are loans for which the principal source of repayment comes from the sale of real estate 
the remaining billion of loans collateralized by real estate at december  are i other commercial loans for which the primary source of repayment is derived from the ongoing cash flow of the business and which are also collateralized by real estate million  ii personal installment loans which are collateralized by real estate million  iii home equity loans million  and iv individual residential mortgage loans million 
the corporation s primary market area includes the state of north carolina  and predominately centers on the metro region of charlotte 
at december   the majority of the total loan portfolio  as well as a substantial portion of the commercial and real estate loan portfolio  represents loans to borrowers within this region 
the diversity of the region s economic base tends to provide a stable lending environment 
no significant concentration of credit risk has been identified due to the diverse industrial base in the region 
in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   pre approved but unused lines of credit for loans totaled million and standby letters of credit aggregated million 
these amounts represent the bank s exposure to credit risk  and in the opinion of management  have no more than the normal lending risk that the bank commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the bank will obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
such obtained collateral varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  and commercial or residential real estate 
management expects that these commitments can be funded through normal operations

the increase in nonaccrual loans was not concentrated in any one industry and was primarily due to the effect of higher interest rates and slower economic growth on some customers 
these relationships are currently in the process of collection 
interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and restructured loans for the years ended december   and  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
interest income on all such loans included in the results of operations for  and amounted to approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest is based on a review of each loan 
generally  accrual of interest is discontinued on loans days past due as to principal or interest unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
management s policy for any accruing loan greater than days past due is to perform an analysis of the loan  including a consideration of the financial position of the borrower and any guarantor as well as the value of the collateral  and use this information to make an assessment as to whether collectibility of the principal and interest appears probable 
based on such a review  management has determined it is probable that the principal as well as the accruing interest on these loans will be collected in full

since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  a continued risk is that the real estate market and economic conditions could change and could result in future losses or require increases in the provision for loan losses 
management currently uses several measures to assess and control the loan portfolio risk 
for example  all loans over a certain dollar amount must receive an in depth review by an analyst in the bank s credit department 
any issues regarding risk assessments of those credits are addressed by the bank s senior risk managers and factored into management s decision to originate or renew the loan 
furthermore  large commitments are reviewed by both an executive loan committee and a board of directors loan committee comprised of executive management  the chief credit officer and senior lending officers of the bank 
the corporation also continues to employ an independent third party risk assessment group to review the underwriting  documentation and risk grading analysis 
this third party group reviews all loan relationships above a certain dollar amount and a sampling of all other credits 
the third party s evaluation and report is shared with executive management  the loan and audit committee of the bank and  ultimately  is reported to the bank and corporation board of directors 
management uses the information developed from the procedures described above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio 
this continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in determining the appropriate levels of the allowance for loan losses 
as part of the continual grading process  individual commercial loans are assigned a credit risk grade based on their credit quality  which is subject to change as conditions warrant 
any changes in those risk assessments as determined by the outside risk assessment group  regulatory examiners or the corporation s risk management division are also considered 
management considers certain commercial loans within weaker credit risk grades to be individually impaired and measures such impairment based upon the value of the collateral 
an estimate of an allowance is made for all other graded loans in the portfolio based on their assigned credit risk grade  type of loan and other matters related to credit risk 
in the allowance for loan loss analysis process  the bank also aggregates non graded loans into pools of similar credits and reviews the historical loss experience associated with these pools as additional criteria to allocate the allowance to each category 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was million or percent of gross loans compared to million or percent at december  and million  or percent at december  the allowance for loan losses increased over the periods presented as a result of changes in the portfolio s perceived risk profile 
the increase in the allowance at december  and was due to loan growth  increased nonperforming assets and the effect of higher interest rates and slower economic growth on some customers 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover inherent losses in the bank s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
management believes it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and in consideration of the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowances based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the following table presents the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses applicable to major loan categories  the percentage of the allowance amount in each category to the total allowance and the percentage of the loans in each category to total loans as of december      and table eleven allocation of the allowance for loan losses december  loan loan loan loan loan dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      installment      total      the allowance amounts assigned to each category of loans represent the historical loss experience of the loans adjusted for current economic events or conditions

total deposits at december  were billion  a percent increase from december  insured money market accounts increased million or percent  and certificates of deposit increased million or percent  while demand deposits decreased million or percent  and savings deposits decreased million or percent 
increases in money market accounts and certificates of deposit were due to marketing campaigns directed toward packaging and promoting these accounts more effectively as well as the purchase of four branches  while the reduction in demand deposit and savings were due to the corporation s management of interest rates paid

liquidity is provided by the ability to attract deposits  flexible repricing schedules in a sizable portion of the loan portfolio  current earnings  a strong capital base and the ability to use alternative funding sources that complement normal sources 
management s asset liability policy is to maximize net interest income while continuing to provide adequate liquidity to meet continuing loan demand and deposit withdrawal requirements and to service normal operating expenses 
if additional funding sources are needed  the bank has access to federal fund lines at correspondent banks and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
in addition to these sources  as described above  the bank is a member of the fhlb  which provides access to fhlb lending sources 
at december   the bank had an available line of credit with the fhlb totaling million with million available 
at december   fcnb also had federal funds back up lines of credit totaling million  of which there were no amounts outstanding 
at december   the corporation had lines of credit totaling million  of which there were no amounts outstanding 
another source of liquidity is the securities available for sale portfolio 
see financial condition investment portfolio for a further discussion 
management believes the bank s sources of liquidity are adequate to meet loan demand  operating needs and deposit withdrawal requirements 
asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management strategy is to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by interest rate changes without unduly penalizing current earnings 
one method used to manage interest rate sensitivity is to measure  over various time periods  the interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  however  this method addresses only the magnitude of timing differences and does not address earnings or market value 
management uses an earnings simulation model to assess the amount of earnings at risk due to changes in interest rates 
this model is updated at least quarterly and is based on a range of interest rate scenarios 
under the corporation s policy  the limit for interest rate risk is percent of net interest income when considering an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points over a twelve month period 
management believes this method more accurately measures interest rate risk 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates over a twelve month period  the earnings simulation model indicates that interest rate risk was within guidelines at approximately percent of net interest income at december  the corporation s balance sheet is liability sensitive  meaning that in a given period there will be more liabilities than assets subject to repricing as market rates change 
because rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the earnings position could improve in a declining rate environment and could deteriorate in a rising rate environment  depending on the correlation of rate changes in these two categories 
at december  total rate sensitive liabilities due within one year were billion compared to rate sensitive assets of billion  for a negative one year cumulative gap of approximately million 
interest sensitivity of the corporation s balance sheet as of a specific date is not necessarily indicative of the corporation s position on other dates 
from time to time  the corporation may use derivative financial instruments including futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
at december   the corporation had no derivative financial instruments 
the corporation is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the corporation 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the corporation until the instrument is exercised

thus  the corporation derives its principal source of income through dividends from the bank 
certain regulatory and other requirements restrict the lending of funds by the bank to the corporation and the amount of dividends which can be paid to the corporation 
in addition  certain regulatory agencies may prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank if they determine that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
at december   the bank is required to obtain prior regulatory approval for payments of dividends

the corporation and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the applicable federal regulatory agencies 
under the federal reserve board the frb standards  the corporation must maintain a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined to total risk weighted assets of percent and a minimum ratio of total capital as defined to risk weighted assets of percent 
tier i capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less certain intangible assets and excluding unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale 
total capital is comprised of tier i capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
total capital must consist of at least percent of tier capital 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the corporation adjusted for their related risk levels using amounts set forth in frb regulations 
in addition to the aforementioned risk based capital requirements  the corporation is subject to a leverage capital requirement  requiring a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined previously to total adjusted average assets of percent to percent 
the bank also has similar regulatory capital requirements imposed by the occ 
see note fifteen of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of requirements 
at december   both the corporation and the bank were in compliance with all existing capital requirements
