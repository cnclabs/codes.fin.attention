item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the year has been a year of growth  challenges and transition for the company and its employees 
the company has added significantly to its product offering through acquisition  internal development and a distribution agreement 
merit has overcome some important challenges in its operations  with a new integrated business management software system as a long term foundation  and is poised for many more improvements in capacities and efficiency than we ve seen to date 
the company is positioned to reap the benefits of a larger  stable sales force with an expanded product offering 
the year has been a time for adjustment from excess inventory and manufacturing capacity and their associated effects on margins 
this past year in europe has continued to be difficult financially  particularly with the dramatic rise of the dollar against the euro and its negative effect on revenues and gross margins for this sector of the business 
in response the entire organization has had a renewed focus on cost reduction and efficiency 
while sales grew in the average head count declined by approximately  and the inventory went down by million while we added over million in inventory for new product introductions 
the company s line of credit balance has declined from its high of million on august  to approximately million on march  so while the company must report a very disappointing year in terms of margins and net income  it is also very optimistic about what was accomplished this year and how merit is positioned for improvements in almost every area 
there are still challenges to grow the top line  to get new products to market  to get europe s direct sales operations profitable  and to balance the production capacities of the angleton catheter facility 
management believes that gross margins net income and cash flow are all on their way up  and interest costs and tax rates are going to also be favorable 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operational data as a percentage of sales sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development income from operations income before income tax expense 
net income 
sales increased by  or  in compared to an increase of  or  in  and an increase of  or  in incremental sales of million from the august angleton catheter line acquisition was the largest contributing factor to the sales rise in sales growth from through was also favorably affected by the introduction of new products and increased sales of existing products sold separately and packaged in custom kits  and increased penetration of the market by merit s inflation devices 
international sales in were approximately million or  compared to million  or  in  and million or  in these increases were primarily a result of the addition of the angleton product lines  ongoing growth in the direct sales in europe  as well as greater acceptance of the company s products in other international markets 
direct sales in france  germany  the uk  belgium  the netherlands and canada were   and  in  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percent of sales was   and in   and  respectively 
the company is operating in a generally declining price market 
there is also a general cost increasing manufacturing environment 
merit has been able to battle this difficult situation with ever increasing production volumes until beginning in early  the company suffered through the implementation of a comprehensive new software system  which in the operations areas lead to difficulties in efficiently operating the purchasing  planning and manufacturing processes of the business 
merit also made a purposeful effort to increase its safety stock levels of inventory in preparation for higher  anticipated sales orders ahead of yk 
the combination of these increased production demands created a build up of capacity in labor and overhead 
as the end of approached  however  the company needed to reduce production levels to match cash flow expectations 
the reduced production volumes created higher overhead cost per unit  lower gross margins  and lower bottom line results 
another important factor negatively effecting gross margins was the large drop in the euro in relation to the dollar during this reduced revenues and gross profit of the european operation by  and reduced over all gross margins by 
in december  the company began the difficult process of down sizing the labor and overhead capacities in the operation of its utah facilities 
the company has made significant progress toward eliminating the large excess negative production variances that were caused by the slow down in production volumes 
this was accomplished by the reduction of approximately people from its high point in december of  or an average reduction of people in compared to this was accomplished primarily by attrition 
there have been many cost reductions and efficiency gains which will lead to improved margins in margins improved in compared to  principally through increased production volumes  automation and efficiencies in manufacturing  and tighter price controls on some of the company s lower margin products 
part of the increased production volumes resulted in a significant increase in inventories in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in over and  or  in over these additional expenditures were related principally to increased costs of expanding the direct sales force and their management both in us and europe 
another important factor has been the costs of implementing and supporting the company s new oracle system and the development of new business opportunities such as acquisitions  product distribution agreements  national accounts and the oem segment of the business 
these increases in costs have grown slower than sales causing selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales to decrease to in  compared to in after increasing from in research and development expenditures for were  an increase of  compared to  in most of this increase was due to the addition of the r d capabilities in angleton  texas with the company s newly acquired catheter technologies 
r d expenses increased in by  compared to  in research and development costs as a percent of sales were  and for  and  respectively 
significantly lower gross margins have more than offset the gains in sales as well as the efficiencies in sg a and r d expenses  the net of which resulted in income from operations of  down from the higher sales and gross margins  together with modest increases in operating expenses  positively affected income from operations in which increased to  up  compared to  in the income tax benefit for was  an effective rate of 
this unusual tax rate was due principally to r d tax credits which the company was able to realize in the fourth quarter of including amended returns for the  and tax years 
management expects the r d tax credit to continue to favorably affect the company s tax rate for at least the next two years 
the income tax provision for was  an effective rate of  compared to  or in the effective tax rate improved significantly in as the ireland facility became profitable and the tax rate became a benefit 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  the company s working capital was  a decrease of over  representing a current ratio of to this decrease was due primarily to the reduction of million in inventory and the repayment of long term debt 
in october  the company also negotiated an increase in its line of credit  to million 
the company had million outstanding under its line of credit at december  merit has financed leasehold improvements and equipment acquisitions through secured notes payable and capital lease arrangements with an outstanding balance of  at december  for the year ended december  the company generated cash from operations in the amount of  the most in the history of the company 
historically  the company has incurred significant expenses in connection with product envelopment and introduction of new products 
this was particularly true in with regard to an increase in inventory  plant and equipment associated with the company s acquisition and new product introductions 
the company s principal source of funding for these and other expenses has been the cash generated from operations  secured loans on equipment  bank lines of credit and sales of equity 
the company believes that its present sources of liquidity and capital are adequate for its current operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market rider the company principally hedges the following currencies belgian francs  german marks  dutch gilders  and irish pounds 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the company from the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
such contracts are not significant 
as of december   the company had million million of variable rate debt  all denominated in us dollars 
interest expense would change by approximately  for every change in interest rates
