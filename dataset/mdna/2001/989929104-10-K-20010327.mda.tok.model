however  increases in the company s sales and its ability to be a leader in the industry depends on its ability to effectively manage industry changes as well as its own growth and organizational changes 
if cd market demand does not grow as expected  revenue growth would be directly and adversely impacted and the manufacturing capacity installed will be underutilized 
pricing strategies of competitors and general economic factors  such as consumer confidence and inflation  all impact the company 
a substantial part of the company s revenue is derived from a small number of key customers  our revenues will be significantly lower than expected if we cannot keep these customers 
in addition  if the company does not respond rapidly to technological changes  it may lose customers  which will cause a significant decrease in revenue 
on march   the company reduced its work force to match current and anticipated business levels 
the company s business has been negatively impacted by the slow down in pc and software spending previously announced by major pc manufacturers and software providers
