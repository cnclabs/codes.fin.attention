item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of internet based voice and fax services 
from our inception in july through april  our operating activities were focused primarily on o developing monitoring and analysis software to enable us to efficiently and cost effectively route voice over the internet which we refer to as bestvalue routing  o developing relationships with affiliates throughout the world to establish the global reach of itxc 
net  o developing additional business strategies to supplement our affiliate network  and o hiring our initial employee group 
in april  we launched our first service delivered over itxc 
net our wwexchange service 
our operations since that time have included o increasing our voice traffic  from  minutes during april to approximately million minutes carried through our wwexchange service during the quarter ended december   o refining our monitoring and analysis software in order to achieve bestvalue routing  o expanding our affiliate network to affiliates at january  and increasing the global reach of itxc 
net  and o increasing our employee headcount  from employees on april  to employees on january  to date  our primary sources of revenue have been the fees that we receive from customers for terminating calls  that they have originated  on the internet 
our revenue for terminating calls over itxc 
net has depended primarily upon the following factors o the volume of voice traffic carried over itxc 
net  which is measured in terms of minutes of voice traffic  o the mix of voice traffic carried over itxc 
net  which reflects the fact that calls made over certain routes will generate greater revenues than calls of a similar duration made over other routes  and o pricing pressures resulting from competitive conditions in our markets 
increased competition from other providers of internet telephony services and traditional telephony services could materially adversely affect revenue in future periods 
we have also received revenues from the subscriber services that we have provided in our webtalknow service since december and from the subscriber and e commerce services that we have provided since october pursuant to our efusion acquisition 
revenues from these services  million for the quarter ended december   consist of minute based revenue  subscriber based revenue and revenue per push 
we received consulting revenue derived from a market trial agreement that we entered into with a third party shortly after our inception in order to generate funds to sustain operations 
under that agreement  we earned a portion of the revenue ratably over the term of the agreement and the remainder of the revenue as we met specific milestones 
we do not consider it likely that we will have future significant consulting revenue 
to date  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers 
the loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and future prospects 
our operating expenses have been primarily o data communications and telecommunications expenses 
internet related expenses  consisting primarily of o costs associated with sending voice traffic over the internet  primarily fees that we pay to our affiliates to terminate or assist us in terminating calls  fees that we pay when we find it necessary to utilize the traditional telephone network or private data networks to terminate calls and expenses incurred in connecting our customers to our network  these expenses are largely proportional to the volume of voice traffic carried over our network  and o costs associated with buying internet access at itxc operated locations  these costs are largely proportional to the bandwidth of access acquired and do not typically vary based upon volume of voice traffic until additional bandwidth needs to be acquired 
o network operations expenses 
expenses associated with operating the network  consisting primarily of the salaries  payroll taxes and benefits that we pay for those employees directly involved in the operation of itxc 
net and related expenses 
from the date of our efusion acquisition  network operations expenses also include related expenses incurred to operate efusion s services 
we expect to eliminate certain duplicative network operations expenses resulting from that acquisition by the second quarter of o selling  general and administrative expenses 
there are three components of selling  general and administrative expenses  consisting of the following o sales and marketing expenses 
salaries  payroll taxes  benefits and commissions that we pay for sales personnel and expenses associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future as we expand our internal sales force  hire additional marketing personnel and increase expenditures for promotion and marketing 
we expect that such expenses will also increase as telecommunications revenue increases 
o development expenses 
salary  payroll tax and benefit expenses that we pay for employees and consultants who work on the development of our network management approaches  e commerce services and future applications of our technology 
we believe that investing in the enhancement of our technology is critical to our future success 
we expect that our development expenses will increase in future periods  based upon various factors  including o the importance to us of bestvalue routing  o the pace of technological change in our industry  and o our goal of expanding the applications of our technology 
o general and administrative expenses 
salary  payroll tax and benefit expenses and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  administration  facilities  information technology and human resources  together with accounts receivable reserves 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we hire additional personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
in addition  we expect to expand our facilities and incur associated expenses to support our anticipated growth 
o non cash employee compensation expenses 
non cash employee compensation represents compensation expense incurred in connection with the grant of certain stock options to our employees with exercise prices less than the fair value of our common stock at the respective dates of grant 
during  but prior to our initial public offering  we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices equal to or less than fair value  resulting in non cash charges of approximately million 
similarly  in connection with our efusion acquisition during  we were required to take non cash charges of approximately million in connection with options granted in exchange for options previously granted by efusion 
our non cash employee compensation charges will be expensed  generally over the next three to seven years  in connection with the underlying vesting periods of the options granted 
the efusion acquisition was consummated on october   in that transaction  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock and accounted for the transaction as a purchase 
we recognized million of goodwill and other intangibles of million  which will all be amortized over a period of five years 
in addition to the amortization charge that we recognized in the fourth quarter  we also wrote off million of in process research and development 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was determined by an independent third party valuation  as technological feasibility had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use as of the date of acquisition 
we believe that the services we provide over the internet are not currently actively regulated in the us several efforts have been made  however  to enact federal legislation that would regulate certain aspects of the internet 
if adopted  such legislation could increase our costs significantly and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and future prospects 
we anticipate that from time to time our operating expenses may increase on a per minute basis as a result of decisions to route additional traffic over the traditional telephone network or private data networks in order to maintain quality transmissions during relatively short periods of time as we transition our network to increased levels of capacity 
during these periods  we occasionally experience reductions in volume from certain customers 
historically  we have satisfactorily resolved these transition issues 
however  in the future other anticipated or unanticipated operating problems associated with the growth of itxc 
net may develop 
since our inception in july  we have experienced operating losses in each quarterly and annual period and negative cash flows from operations in each quarter since we commenced offering services over itxc 
net in april as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the profit potential of our business is unproven  and our limited operating history makes an evaluation of us and our prospects difficult 
we may not achieve profitability or  if we achieve profitability  we might not sustain profitability 
in february  we recast our relationship with our partner in our south american joint venture 
we issued  shares of our common stock for equity in a private affiliate of our joint venture partner  a termination of the puts and calls which previously could have required substantial cash or equity outlays by us  and certain contractual commitments by the parties 
as part of that transaction  we terminated our joint venture agreement and the license agreement that we previously furnished to the joint venture 
however  we have not experienced a material change in our service to the carriers in the territory previously serviced by the joint venture  since the new arrangement contemplates the continuation of service to those carriers 
from an accounting perspective  during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million  representing the difference between the value of the  shares issued by itxc  valued as of the time of the transaction  and the value of the equity received by itxc 
an additional charge of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of  to reduce our investment in telenova to  reflecting an other than temporary decline in such investment 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue our revenue other than consulting revenue for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we were able to achieve this increase despite our decision to terminate services to certain customers 
see operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
the principal aspect of this increase was the increased revenue generated from our wwexchange service  which provides international call completion to itxc s customers and enables them to offer their own customers phone to phone global voice service 
our wwexchange service was responsible for million of revenues during the year ended december   as compared with million during during  revenues from our webtalknow service a pc to telephone service which allows internet portals  internet service providers and web sites to offer web to phone calling to their customers under their own brands  our call completion service and our push to talk services amounted to million 
we carried million minutes of traffic over itxc 
net in  as compared with million minutes during of the total minutes  million minutes were carried through itxc s wwexchange service and million minutes were provided through our webtalknow service 
revenues from the webtalknow service were less than expected during our webtalknow customers had  in most cases  business models that were dependent on significant advertising revenues from dot 
com companies 
those companies our customers customers were dramatically impacted by setbacks in the capital markets during the last nine months of our consulting revenue increased from  during to  during our periodic receipt of consulting revenues reflected the accomplishment of various performance requirements under our market trial agreement 
we did not earn any consulting revenue during and do not expect to earn substantial consulting revenue in subsequent periods 
operating expenses data communications and telecommunications expenses 
we did not incur data communications and telecommunications expenses until we began providing service over itxc 
net in april during the year ended december   such expenses amounted to million  as compared to telecommunications revenue of million during that period 
during the year ended december   such expenses amounted to million  compared to telecommunications revenue of million 
during the year ended december   such expenses amounted to million  compared to telecommunications revenue of million 
the increase in the dollar amount of such costs during primarily reflected the increased traffic during as well as costs associated with establishing a new network hub in jersey city  new jersey during the first quarter of and expanding that hub later during the year  establishing a new network hub in london  england during the second quarter of  and establishing and increasing capacity at itxc s other hubs in anticipation of future growth in traffic 
cost of consulting revenue 
we did not incur any expenses under our market trial agreement during any of the periods described in this annual report other than the year ended december  during that period  the cost of consulting revenue amounted to  representing of consulting revenue 
since  we were only required to present an update report  which we provided in network operations expenses 
network operations expenses increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  and to million during the year ended december  expenses during  representing of our telecommunications revenue  were incurred in preparing for the implementation of our wwexchange service in april and in the initial delivery of that service 
during and  such expenses primarily reflected the cost of operating our hours a day  days a week network operations center in princeton  new jersey  as well as start up costs associated with the jersey city  new jersey and london hubs  and represented of telecommunications revenue in and of telecommunications revenue in in general  network operations expenses are not proportional to the volume of our traffic  regardless of our volume  we are required to pay the salaries and related costs associated with operating our network operations center in princeton and operating our e commerce service function in beaverton  oregon 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  the increases reflected enhanced sales and marketing efforts that we undertook as our network expanded  growth in our sales and marketing staffs  commissions paid on increasing telecommunications revenue  our hiring of employees and engaging of consultants for development tasks  a substantial increase in the number of general and administrative personnel hired to support our growth and expenses associated with our efusion business incurred after the acquisition of that company in october the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during and also included charges of million and million  respectively  representing additional accounts receivable reserves and write offs 
these charges reflect general industry trends and the discontinuance of service to certain significant customers because of their failure to meet their payment obligations 
furthermore  during march   it became necessary for us to discontinue service to another substantial customer representing million of revenues during january and february of  as a result of its failure to meet payment obligations 
at that time  our account receivable for such customer amounted to million 
we expect to take an additional charge with respect to this customer in our march  consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect any material revenue impact from these matters 
such expectation represents a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ from such expectation as a result of a number of factors  including the extent to which we are able to attract new customers to itxc 
net  the extent to which we are able to expand the utilization of itxc 
net by other existing customers  our capacity constraints and the mix of traffic that we carry in future periods 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in  reflecting the leveraging of such expenses over our significantly increased revenue base 
as our revenues continue to grow  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
such expectation represents a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ from such expectation as a result of a number of factors  including the extent to which we incur unanticipated expenses associated with revenue growth and other factors referred to in our filings with the sec 
depreciation depreciation expense increased from  in to million in and million in  reflecting the expansion of our network and hubs and the addition of new technologies deployed throughout our network 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation expense was in  in and in  reflecting our efforts to build our infrastructure to support future growth 
amortization and write off of intangibles we recorded million of goodwill in connection with our acquisition of efusion  which was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
for  we amortized million of this goodwill 
in addition  we recorded other intangibles of million  of which million was amortized in and the balance of which will be amortized over five years 
we also wrote off million of in process research and development associated with our efusion acquisition 
because the efusion acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction  efusion s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements solely for the period from october  through december  non cash employee compensation expenses non cash employee compensation expense increased from  during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   representing amortization of deferred compensation incurred in connection with the grant of options at exercise prices less than fair value 
interest income  net our interest income  net principally represents income from cash and investments which  in turn  were derived from capital contributions made by our investors 
in addition to the capital invested near the inception of our business  we raised net proceeds of million and million from a group of investors in private transactions completed during april and february  respectively  we raised net proceeds of million from our initial public offering completed in october and we raised net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering completed in march during the year ended december   interest generated from capital contributions exceeded by  the interest that we paid on our line of credit and non cash interest related to the issuance of common stock warrants in connection with bridge financing provided by two officers 
during the years ended december  and  the interest on our marketable securities  including the interest earned on the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings  exceeded the interest that we paid on our line of credit and capital leases by million and million  respectively 
loss associated with investments and joint venture during the year ended december   we incurred non cash charges of million relating to the modifications made in our south american joint venture 
approximately million of these charges reflected the difference between the value of our stock that we issued at the time of such modifications and the value of the capital stock that we received in exchange for that stock valued as of the time of the transaction 
the balance of these charges relates to a reduction in the value of the shares that we received  reflecting an other than temporary decline in such investment

net proceeds from our initial public offering  including proceeds resulting from the exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option  were million 
this capital was supplemented by net proceeds of million raised upon consummation of our march follow on offering of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of our capital stock 
net cash used in operating activities amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities in these periods was primarily the result of net operating losses and increased accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the purchases of property and equipment and purchases of investments with the proceeds of our initial public offering and follow on offering 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating and capital leases 
at that date  future minimum payments for non cancelable leases includes required payments of million during and million for years and thereafter under all leases 
we anticipate a substantial increase in capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with the anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we maintain a credit agreement that provides a committed line of credit from a financial institution in the aggregate amount of million 
we are permitted to use any portion of that commitment under a revolving line of credit for working capital or under an equipment sub line for the purchase of certain capital equipment and related software 
this credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
we are permitted to borrow under the credit agreement until june at that time  we must repay the outstanding working capital loans unless that revolving line is extended

we have arranged for financing in the ordinary course for gateway equipment  switching equipment and general office equipment  from third parties and vendors 
see notes and of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our services  the responses of our competitors  the resources allocated to itxc 
net and the development of future applications of our technology  our success in marketing and selling our services  and other factors 
we have experienced substantial increases in our capital expenditures since our inception  consistent with growth in our operations and staffing  and we anticipate that our capital expenditures will continue to increase in the future 
we will evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  technologies or services and plan to expand our sales and marketing programs 
any such possible acquisition may be material and may require us to incur a significant amount of debt or issue a significant number of equity securities 
further  any businesses that we acquire will likely have their own capital needs  which may be significant  which we would be called upon to satisfy independent of the acquisition price 
we currently believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
this statement represents a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from our expectations 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new or enhance existing services  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire or invest in complementary business  technologies or services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we had investments of approximately million as of december   in certain marketable securities  which primarily consisted of short term fixed income investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results
