the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities

at the present time  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuation

based upon a hypothetical increase in the interest rate and assuming all other conditions affecting market risk remain constant  the market value of the company s fixed rate debt would be impacted by a decrease of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively

panavision had no interest rate swap agreements in effect at december  management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed
