the company expects non operating income to decrease as interest income on cash and investments decreases 
this is due to a decrease in interest rates and a decrease in cash reserves to fund acquisitions subsequent to march  the company does not expect to continue to benefit from gains on foreign currency transactions 
no short term borrowing requirements are expected  this expectation could be affected substantially by newly identified investment opportunities including acquisitions

the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the current year s rate is the net effect of a domestic tax rate combined with a foreign tax rate on taxable net income 
the increased effective rate is primarily due to proportionately higher domestic income in fiscal seasonality and inflation group in the past has experienced greater sales and earnings in the january march quarter  the fourth quarter of its fiscal year  there can be no assurance  however  that this will occur in the future 
this seasonal factor is believed to be attributable to buying patterns of major accounts and also to fiscal year incentives for group s sales representatives 
group s revenue and resultant earnings have shown substantial variation on a quarter to quarter basis 
the company s license agreements represent the culmination of a sales cycle averaging three to six months 
any significant lengthening in the sales cycle can have the effect of moving revenue from one quarter into the next  contributing to quarter to quarter variations 
prices remain stable for group s products 
inflation directly affects group s cost structure principally in the areas of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and support services and supplies 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was million at march  as compared with million a year earlier 
the current ratio was to at march  and to at march  note that the current portion of deferred revenue related to maintenance contracts is included in current liabilities 
accordingly  working capital and current ratios may not be directly comparable to such data for companies in other industries where similar revenue deferrals are not typical

additionally  the company maintains a million line of credit arrangement with a commercial bank  expiring october  the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus basis points  at group s option 
the line of credit is not collateralized but requires group to maintain certain operating ratios

proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million were partially offset by principal payments on capital leases and preferred dividends of million for a total of million cash provided by financing activities 
group continually evaluates the credit and market risks associated with outstanding receivables 
in the course of this review  group considers many factors specific to the individual client as well as to the concentration of receivables within industry groups

the company believes that its current minimum lease obligations and other short term and long term liquidity needs can be met from its existing cash and short term investment balances and cash flows from operations

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which will be effective for our fiscal year this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  further amending fas no 
currently the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments and has no plans to do so in the future 
therefore  the adoption of sfas nos 
 and will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a subsidiary in the united kingdom with offices throughout continental europe 
additionally  the company uses third party distributors to market and distribute its products in other international regions 
transactions conducted by the subsidiary are typically denominated in the local country currency  while transactions conducted by the distributors are typically denominated in pounds sterling 
as a result  the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its subsidiary and third party distributors are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and impact overall expected profitability 
however  through and as of march   the company s exposure was not material to the financial statements taken as a whole 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency market risk 
the company does not have any financial instruments subject to material market risk 
risk factors our total revenue and operating results may fluctuate 
we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our total revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  but are not necessarily limited to level of product  services and price competition  length of our sales cycle and customer licensing patterns  the size and timing of individual license transactions  delay or deferral of customer purchase and implementations of our products  success in expanding or maintaining our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  appropriate mix of products licensed and services sold  levels of international transactions  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  labor turnover and timing of new hires and the allocation of our resources  changes in the economy and foreign currency exchange rates  and our ability to develop and market new products and control costs satisfactory completion of services we provide performance of key third party service providers one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our total revenue and operating results may vary drastically from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that may affect these fluctuations are the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  the potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transacions  the timing of new product releases  seasonal variations in operating results  and variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
each customer s decision to purchase our products and services is discretionary and is subject to its budget cycles 
in addition  the timing of license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  which has ranged to date from one to eighteen months 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
if these expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
the reader should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
we need to successfully integrate acquisitions and manage growth 
our business strategy includes pursuing opportunities to grow our business  both internally and through selective acquisitions and strategic alliances 
our ability to implement this strategy depends  in part  on our success in making such acquisitions and strategic alliances on satisfactory terms and successfully integrating them into our operations 
implementation of our growth strategy may impose significant strains on our management  operating systems and financial resources 
failure to manage this growth  or unexpected difficulties encountered during expansion  could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market 
group s web service applications communicate through public and private networks over the internet 
the success of our products may depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing products that are compatible with the internet 
we cannot predict with any assurance whether the demand for internet related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our products and the introduction of new products 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  privacy  demand  reliability  rate of adoption  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service and potential tax or other government regulation  remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to support the functionality of our products and distribution of our software 
if these critical issues are not favorably resolved  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our continued success will require us to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by i rapid technological change  ii frequent introductions of new products  iii changing customer needs and iv evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  we must support existing products and develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of our products that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements to group s products are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forego purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
software errors or defects in our products could reduce revenues 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released  and could be affected by viruses 
we have  in the past  been forced to delay the commercial release of products until software problems have been corrected 
we could lose revenues as a result of software viruses  errors or defects  including defects in third party products with which our products work 
testing errors may also be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully manage our growth  our business may be negatively impacted 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business has grown rapidly in recent years 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
in addition  this growth may require us to implement new systems or upgrade current systems  and the failure to successfully implement such new or improved systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
to manage future growth  we must continue to i implement and improve our financial  operational and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and ii expand  train and manage our employee work force 
integration of personnel and operations relating to our previous or future acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
we acquired two companies subsequent to year end  and we may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel  operations  acquired technology and products into our business 
in particular  we will need to assimilate and retain key professional services  sales  development and marketing personnel 
key personnel from the acquired companies may in the future decide to pursue other opportunities 
in addition  it may be necessary to integrate products of these companies with our technology  and it is uncertain whether we may accomplish this easily or at all 
these integration difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees or increase expenses 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and we may also face unexpected costs  which may adversely affect operating results in any quarter 
due to these and other factors  we may not meet expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to revenues or other operating results of the combined company  which could adversely affect our stock price 
if we acquire additional companies  products or technologies  we may face risks similar to those faced in our other acquisitions 
we may continue to make other investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any other acquisition or investment 
if we acquire another company  we will likely face the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions as discussed above with respect to our other acquisitions 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary information 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we also believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
notwithstanding these  it may be possible for other persons to obtain copies of group s products 
group believes that because of the rapid pace of technological change in the technology industry and changes in postal regulations that affect several core products  copyright and trade secret protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge and experience of group s management and other personnel and their ability to develop  enhance  market and acquire new products 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate 
although we do not believe that we are infringing on any proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
furthermore  former employers of our former  current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of such former employers 
any such claims  with or without merit  could i be time consuming to defend  ii result in costly litigation  iii divert management s attention and resources  iv cause product delays in product and services deliveries and v require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license or create a workaround for such infringed or similar technology may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we license certain software from third parties 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  any of these software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international operations involve unique risks 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including i foreign currency fluctuations  ii economic or political instability  iii shipping delays and iv various trade restrictions 
any of these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
significant increases in the level of customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in situations where direct sales are denominated in foreign currency  any fluctuation in foreign currency or the exchange rate may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant contracts  changes in earning estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the software and computer industries and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock
