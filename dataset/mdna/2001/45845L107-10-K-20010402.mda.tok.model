item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is qualified by reference to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion also contains forward looking statements which are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed on page of this annual report 
overview we derive revenues primarily from the following sources 
electronic funds transfer  or eft  processing services  
core data processing systems  support  maintenance and related services  
check imaging systems  support and related services  
data communications management  and 
ancillary products and services  including maintenance and technical support services  sales of banking related equipment and complementary products 
we derive eft revenues principally from processing atm and debit card transactions 
we receive a base fee for providing our atm processing services and an additional fee for each atm serviced 
once the number of transactions by a financial institution exceeds established levels  typically between  and  transactions per month  we charge additional fees for the extra transactions processed 
for debit card transactions  we generally receive a portion of the interchange fees charged by our financial institution customers  and we charge a monthly fee if our customers do not meet a certain minimum dollar amount of transactions for a particular month 
most charges due under our eft service agreements are paid monthly 
on a service bureau basis  we generate core data processing revenues from service and processing fees based on the volume of transactions processed 
these revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
we also generate core data processing revenues by licensing bancpac or bancline  our proprietary windows r nt based client server software systems  on an in house basis 
we recognize revenues for licensing bancpac and bancline in accordance with statement of position on software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
we recognize software license fees when we have signed a non cancelable license agreement  shipped the product and satisfied significant obligations to the customer 
we license on an in house basis renaissance tm software  our proprietary check imaging software that we acquired in august as a result of our acquisition of sbs corp 
see business our acquisitions 
we generate revenues from license fees and recurring annual maintenance fees charged for this system 
revenues from licensing of renaissance are recognized in accordance with statement of position  as discussed above 
we also provide check imaging in a service bureau environment 
on a service bureau basis  we generate revenues based on the volume of items processed 
this revenue is recognized as we provide the service 
we generate our data communications management service revenues principally from network management and data traffic across our frame relay network and from equipment configuration  installation and sales 
we charge a flat monthly fee for providing telecommunications connectivity and network management as well as an installation charge 
our ancillary products and services generate revenues primarily from our maintenance and technical support services as well as sales of equipment 
we recognize maintenance and technical support service revenues as the service period elapses 
we recognize equipment sales revenues at the time of shipment 
in june  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
since that time  we have completed a number of acquisitions 
see business our acquisitions for a discussion of these acquisitions 
we originally accounted for our acquisition of direct access in march as a pooling of interest 
as a result of the transactions described in business our relationship with netzee  we have changed the accounting for the direct access acquisition to a purchase 
our acquisition of advanced computer enterprises ace in august was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all of our acquisitions since our initial public offering  with the exception of ace  have been accounted for as purchases 
our financial results have been restated to include the results of ace for all periods presented 
due to netzee s issuance of common stock in connection with transactions that occurred on september   our ownership percentage in netzee decreased to approximately as of that date 
as a result  we no longer consolidate netzee s results of operations with our results of operations 
we now account for our investment in netzee under the equity method  which requires us to record the results of operations of netzee in a single line item in our statement of operations titled equity in loss of affiliate 
because we provided unlimited funding to netzee until completion of their initial public offering in november  all of netzee s losses prior to the completion of the offering are included in that line item rather than our relative percentage of those losses 
following the completion of the initial public offering we have recorded only our relative percentage of netzee s net losses 
as of december  we owned approximately of netzee s common stock 
we base our expenses to a significant extent on our expectations of future revenues 
most of our expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if our revenues are lower than we expect 
in an attempt to enhance our long term competitive position  we may also make decisions regarding pricing  marketing  services and technology that could have an adverse near term effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  our eft revenues are based in large part on various interchange and transaction fees set by visa and mastercard 
any changes in these fees  whether as a result of a pending dispute or otherwise  could negatively impact our revenues 
due to the foregoing factors and other risks discussed in our sec filings  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps significantly

interest and other income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from income of million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in gains recognized associated with changes in the ownership of netzee  inc offset by interest income of million from investments of the proceeds from our public offering of stock in february for an explanation of the netzee  inc loss see note to our financial statements

there was no equity in loss of affiliate for the year ended december minority interest in loss income of consolidated subsidiary 
minority interest in income increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to profits in proimage s operations 
liquidity and capital resources since our incorporation  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash from operations  borrowings from banks and sales of our common stock  including our initial public offering in june  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million  and our public offering in february  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in earnings  excluding the non cash effects of our investment in netzee 
the increase in the net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in earnings 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in as compared to was attributable to investment of the proceeds from our offering of common stock completed in february as well as increased capital expenditures and acquisitions during the increase in net cash used in investing activities in as compared to was primarily due to a receivable created from the funding of netzee s operations and acquisitions during the period 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash generated for compared to is due to the net proceeds from our offering of common stock completed in february of million  offset by repayments of borrowings under our credit facility using a portion of the offering proceeds 
the increase in net cash for compared to was primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility due to the funding of netzee s operations and acquisitions during the period 
during  we entered into a credit facility with first union national bank 
under this facility  as amended  we may borrow up to million for working capital and to fund acquisitions and pay expenses related to acquisitions 
during  we extended the term of the facility from april  to june  the first union credit facility contains provisions which require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth amounts and which restrict our ability to incur additional debt  make certain capital expenditures  enter into agreements for mergers  acquisitions or the sale of substantial assets and pay cash dividends 
interest is payable monthly  and outstanding principal amounts accrue interest at an annual rate equal to either a a floating rate equal to the lender s prime rate minus or b a floating rate equal to the libor market index rate 
on december   the interest rate under this facility was approximately 
in connection with our acquisition of sbs corp 
and sbs data services  inc  we borrowed million from first union and loaned that amount to our subsidiary  direct access  to pay a portion of the purchase price for sbs corp 
and to pay some outstanding liabilities of sbs corp 
in september  we borrowed an additional million under the first union credit facility and loaned that amount to netzee to pay a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions of other companies 
netzee repaid these loans with some of the net proceeds from its initial public offering  which was completed in november netzee has borrowed additional monies from us and we have committed  subject to some conditions  to provide to netzee a million line of credit for its working capital needs 
in february  we acquired dpsc software  inc from netzee for approximately million which reduced the balance outstanding on the line of credit 
netzee has subsequently borrowed additional funds from us  and as of march   a total of million was due from netzee under this line of credit 
we plan to finance this line of credit with cash on hand and additional borrowings under our credit facility with first union 
netzee may require additional funds to support its operations 
netzee may seek to raise capital through public or private offering of debt or equity  the sale of assets  or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available  on terms favorable to netzee  if at all 
netzee s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet it s obligations as they may come due may be dependent upon their ability to raise additional capital funds 
we no longer consolidate netzee s results of operations with our results of operations 
we now account for our investment in netzee under the equity method  which requires us to record the results of operations of netzee in a single line item in our statement of operations titled equity in loss of affiliate 
because we provided unlimited funding to netzee until completion of its initial public offering in november  all of netzee s losses prior to the completion of the offering are included in that line item rather than our relative percentage of those losses 
following the completion of netzee s offering we have recorded only our relative percentage of netzee s net losses 
as of december  we owned approximately of netzee s common stock 
as of december  our investment in netzee was million which exceeded the market value of million as of that date 
we believe that this reduction in value is temporary  however  if this reduction becomes other than temporary  we may have to write down our investment in netzee 
in addition  netzee has a history of losses and may never become profitable 
we will continue to account for our investment in netzee under the equity method which will result in additional losses on our investment until netzee becomes profitable 
the impact of netzee s results of operations on our financial condition  including our shareholders equity  is uncertain  and we cannot guarantee we will benefit from our ownership in netzee 
on january   we acquired the core data processing  check imaging  and item capture center operations of slmsoft 
com inc  a kansas corporation  and certain software from slmsoft 
com inc an ontario corporation 
we paid million in cash and issued or agreed to issue up to  shares of our common stock in the transaction 
on march   we acquired c teq  inc  an oklahoma corporation that is a provider of data processing and check and statement imaging to approximately community financial institutions located in oklahoma and texas 
we paid million in cash in connection with the acquisition 
the cash portion of the acquisition of slmsoft 
com  and the acquisition of dpsc and c teq were financed through the use of cash on hand and an increase in amounts outstanding under our line of credit with first union national bank 
while there can be no assurance  we believe that the net proceeds to us from our offering of common stock in february  together with funds currently on hand  funds to be provided by operations and funds available for working capital purposes under the first union credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital expenditures and liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
we intend to grow  in part  through strategic acquisitions and expect to make additional expenditures to negotiate and consummate acquisition transactions and integrate the acquired companies 
no assurance can be made with respect to the actual timing and amount of the expenditures and acquisitions 
in addition  no assurance can be given that we will complete any acquisitions on terms favorable to us  if at all  or that additional sources of financing will not be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investments and do not have significant operations subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
borrowings under the first union credit facility accrue interest at a fluctuating rate based either upon the lender s prime rate or libor 
as of march   there was million outstanding under this facility 
any future borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates which dramatically increase the interest rate on the credit facility would make it more costly to borrow under that facility and may impede our acquisition and growth strategies if we determine that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
additional loans to netzee may increase the amount outstanding under this facility
