item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general you should read the following discussion and analysis together with the consolidated financial statements of apex silver mines limited and the selected financial data and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
apex limited is a mining exploration and development company that holds a portfolio of silver exploration and development properties primarily in south america  mexico and central america 
none of these properties are in production and  consequently  we have no current operating income or cash flow 
we currently focus our resources primarily on the development of our san cristobal project in bolivia and our continued efforts to secure appropriate financing 
our company completed an initial public offering of ordinary shares on december  we completed a subsequent offering of ordinary shares and warrants during november results of operations interest and other income 
our company does not yet produce silver or any other mineral products and has no revenues from product sales 
our primary source of revenue is interest income 
our policy is to invest all excess cash in liquid  high credit quality  short term financial instruments 
our interest and other income for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other income compared to is primarily the result of interest earned on higher average cash balances during as the result of the net proceeds of our november offering of ordinary shares and warrants 
the decrease in our interest and other income for compared to was due to the reduced average cash balance during  prior to the receipt of the net proceeds of our november offering 
exploration 
our company expenses mineral exploration expenditures as incurred on each property until we determine that mining operations on that property are feasible 
once we have determined that a mineral property has proven and probable ore reserves  we capitalize all development costs 
through december   we have expensed all acquisition and exploration costs as incurred 
since september   we have capitalized development costs associated with the san cristobal project and will continue to do so in the future 
our exploration expenses  including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses  were million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in our exploration expenses for these periods is due primarily to the reduced emphasis on exploration as we concentrate our resources on the development of the san cristobal project 
administrative 
our administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily due to costs and fees directly related to our project financing efforts and stock compensation 
the decrease in our administrative expenses for compared to is primarily the result of the refocusing of our efforts on development activities at the san cristobal project 
income taxes 
apex silver mines corporation  our us management services company  is subject to us income taxes 
otherwise our company pays no income tax in the us since we are incorporated in the cayman islands and conduct no business that currently generates us taxable income 
the cayman islands currently impose no corporate taxation 
our company has been granted exemption until january  from any form of corporate taxation which may subsequently be adopted in the cayman islands 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents during is due to the investment of approximately million in property  plant and equipment related to the development of san cristobal  million in cash used in operations  which is net of interest and other income and is primarily related to administration and exploration  and million of payments on outstanding notes 
in september  our company amended and replaced its registration statement at the securities and exchange commission with a universal shelf registration statement 
the universal shelf registration statement became effective september   and allows us to raise up to million by selling any combination of equity or debt securities listed in the statement 
proceeds from offering s under the shelf registration  if any  may be used to construct and develop san cristobal  continue exploring our other properties  maintain control or ownership of our properties  acquire additional mining related properties or businesses and for general corporate purposes 
it is anticipated that project financing will constitute the substantial majority of the overall financing for the san cristobal project 
at december  no securities had been sold under the universal shelf registration statement 
in february   ordinary shares were issued under the shelf registration statement as consideration for acquisition of an exploration property 
based on estimated revisions made during to the september feasibility study for the san cristobal project  which assumes contract mining  we expect capital costs for construction to total approximately million  of which approximately million has been spent through december  the million is net of approximately million in expected tax credits of which approximately million is expected to be recovered during the project s construction phase  and the remaining million is expected to be recovered against our future bolivian income taxes 
we estimate project spending for the year to range from approximately million to million  depending upon when fabrication of major capital items commences 
we plan to fund project expenditures from our existing cash balances 
these expenditures may be significantly reduced if our company decides to delay the construction schedule while waiting for an improvement in financial and metals markets 
we have this financial flexibility due to our existing cash balances and low debt 
in order to maintain our mineral properties  we must make certain payments including government mineral patent fees and commissions  work commitments  lease and option payments and advance royalties 
in order to maintain our current portfolio of mineral properties  we will be required to make payments during the next twelve months of approximately million for san cristobal  million for platosa and million for our other exploration properties 
in addition  we expect to make expenditures for other continuing exploration  property acquisition  property evaluation and general corporate expenses 
total exploration and administrative expense is not anticipated to increase significantly during the next twelve months 
we expect to fund these obligations from existing cash balances 
we will be required to raise significant additional debt and equity financing from outside sources to complete development of the san cristobal project 
in may  two key multilateral funding agencies  international finance corporation and corporacion andina de fomento  joined our co lead arrangers for project financing  barclays and deutsche bank  to develop multilateral financing options for san cristobal as part of a total financing package that may incorporate support from other official agencies as well as debt financing from banks and the capital markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required financing on terms that we find attractive  or at all 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
our management expects to be able to comply with those laws and does not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with its mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with best contemporary industry practice 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  our major principal cash balances are held in us dollars 
we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and therefore have a relative low exposure to currency fluctuations 
because we conduct our activities largely in several foreign countries  we may in the future engage in hedging activities to minimize the risk of exposure to currency and interest rate fluctuations 
we expect that we will be required to hedge some portion of our planned production in advance in order to complete the financing necessary to develop san cristobal 
in addition  as we bring san cristobal into production and begin to derive revenue from the production  sale and exchange of metals  we may utilize various price hedging techniques to lock in forward delivery prices on a portion of our production 
we would expect to balance the use of price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce while allowing us to take advantage of rising metal prices should they occur 
our company has engaged in limited metals trading activities utilizing puts and calls in a manner similar to anticipated lender requirements 
at december   we recorded a year to date mark to market gain of approximately  from these activities 
there can be no assurance that we will always benefit from the use of these techniques
