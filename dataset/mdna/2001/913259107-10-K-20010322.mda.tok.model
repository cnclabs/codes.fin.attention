item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations earnings and dividends diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended and  respectively 
as shown in the table below  in  utility operations contributed per share  while non regulated operations lost per share related to planned start up costs of the company s e commerce business  usource 
contributing positively to the company s utility operations earnings is a slight increase in distribution revenues  offset by higher depreciation and amortization and nonoperating expenses 
the usource loss was the result of planned expenditures for sales  marketing  and product development 
in  utility operations contributed per share  while usource operations lost per share 
diluted earnings per share utility operations usource total company net income applicable to common stock for the year ended december   was million  compared to million and million for years ended and  respectively 
the average return on common equity was   and in   and  respectively 
the lower net income and average return on common equity in primarily reflects the impact on current income of the company s expenditures on usource 
unitil s annual common stock dividend in was per share 
this annual dividend of in resulted in a payout ratio of for the year 
excluding the loss from non regulated operations  the payout was on earnings from utility operations 
at its january meeting  the unitil board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on the company s common stock of per share 
this quarterly dividend reflects the current annual dividend rate of per share 
the year in review in  unitil corporation remained proactive in managing the challenges of industry restructuring and volatile energy markets  while pursuing opportunities in the e commerce sector through our investment in enermetrix and the companion start up of usource  our energy related e commerce marketplace 
our distribution companies continued to address the changing regulatory environment in massachusetts and new hampshire 
at the same time  we have devoted significant resources to developing and implementing strategies to grow usource and create future value for shareholders 
the higher and more volatile energy prices experienced during resulted in higher commodity prices for our utility customers and lower than expected transaction volume for usource 
utility restructuring in massachusetts continues to move forward 
a significant development for our massachusetts subsidiary  fitchburg gas electric light company fg e  was the settlement of its claims against northeast utilities nu for damages related to the shutdown of millstone nuclear unit see regulatory matters  page 
a major benefit of the settlement was the inclusion of fg e s minority interest in the sale of millstone and the elimination of further decommissioning funding and liability for fg e 
the millstone sale  expected to be completed in  is another step in the divestiture of fg e s generation assets and marks the company s exit from the nuclear power business 
fg e also filed with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte new gas tariffs to implement natural gas unbundling  which became effective november  the company continues to monitor the regulatory and legislative proceedings dealing with electric restructuring in new hampshire  and to develop plans for the transition to a competitive electric market 
the volatility of the wholesale energy markets for electric and natural gas energy commodities during resulted in increased electricity and gas supply costs to the company and our customers 
the energy costs incurred by the company to procure electricity and natural gas on behalf of its customers are reconciled and recovered through regulated cost recovery adjustment mechanisms with no markup or profit margin 
however  these increases in power and gas supply costs resulted in significantly higher working capital requirements and short term borrowing in  reflecting the inherent lag in the regulatory cost recovery process 
by carefully tracking the energy markets  and obtaining timely decisions to adjust retail prices to match rising wholesale costs  unitil has avoided the creation of a sustained gap between wholesale prices and retail rates 
these rate adjustments have allowed the company to begin recovering the higher energy supply costs from our customers  and to improve the company s cash flow and credit position 
at the same time  the company has stepped up its efforts to reach out to its electric and gas customers with information about financial assistance  bill payment options  and energy conservation 
the volatile conditions in energy markets  particularly the significant increase in electricity and natural gas prices during the second half of the year  have also impacted usource  resulting in evolving and expanded strategies 
the usource business model strategy calls for combining direct customer contact through its sales force and on line e commerce access usourceonline 
com to provide a total energy solutions approach for prospective customers 
our efforts during the second half of were focused on refining this strategy and accelerating technology to launch an updated version of the new platform in january usource in the fourth quarter of  unitil corporation launched a new start up business  usource usourceonline 
com  with the mission to be a national leader  through our internet based marketplace  in providing customers with choice and control over their energy procurement and with a portfolio of related products and services 
the usource business strategy is based on a very simple goal to meet business customers need of accessing and managing the increasingly tumultuous energy markets for electricity and natural gas procurement 
through december   usource recorded a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million for partial year the earnings per share impact of the usource loss was compared to a loss of for the partial year of operations 
pursuant to brokerage activities in  approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas were delivered  which generated revenues of million 
capital expenditures related to usource development totaled million in  versus million in the million for includes million for software development and computer equipment and million for customer list acquisitions see note  usource 
operating revenues electric unit kwh sales unitil s total electric kilowatt hour kwh sales decreased by in compared to this decrease reflects the loss of a major customer that ceased operations in the second quarter of  and a cooler than normal summer in absent the loss of this major customer  total kwh sales in were flat compared to this primarily reflects continued growth in the number of customers served by the company  offset by a cooler than normal summer season in sales to residential customers increased by in compared to  and were higher than sales 
the slight increase in energy sales in  as compared to  was due to a increase in the number of residential customers that the company serves  offset by lower usage of electricity for cooling purposes during the summer 
this summer was cooler than normal 
the increase in as compared to is the result of a increase in residential customers  as well as a colder winter heating season in commercial and industrial sales of electricity were down in compared to  primarily related to the shutdown in june  of a major customer 
exclusive of this customer  commercial and industrial sales were flat compared to the prior year  reflecting the cooler summer weather in sales were higher by compared to  reflecting a healthy regional economy offset by a reduction in sales to the customer discussed above 
the following table details total kilowatt hour sales for the last three years by major customer class kwh sales s residential commercial industrial total kwh sales electric operating revenue increased by million  or  in compared to this increase in revenue is a result of increased fuel and energy supply prices  offset by decreased sales volume 
the energy component of electric operating revenue represents the recovery of energy supply costs  which are collected from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms 
changes in energy supply prices do not affect net income  as they normally mirror corresponding changes in energy supply costs 
in addition  an approximate million decrease in revenue was recorded in the year related to an order by the mdte disallowing certain revenues associated with conservation and load management programs subsequent to the march implementation of electric utility industry restructuring in massachusetts

operating expenses fuel and purchased power expense is the cost of power supply  including fuel used in electric generation and the price of wholesale energy and capacity  that meets unitil s electric energy requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses  normally recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms  increased million  or  in compared to the change was driven by an increase in wholesale power prices  as the nation experienced volatile markets and rising energy prices in gas purchased for resale reflects gas purchased and manufactured to supply the company s total gas energy requirements 
gas supply costs are recoverable from customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
purchased gas costs increased by million or in compared to  reflecting an increase in therms purchased and significantly higher wholesale gas prices in operation and maintenance expense includes electric and gas utility operating costs  and the operating cost of the company s non regulated business activities 
total operating and maintenance expense was relatively flat in compared to utility operations accounted for a net decrease of million  reflecting effective cost management and business process improvements 
usource operating and maintenance expense increased by million in compared to  reflecting planned sales  marketing  and product development expenditures 
depreciation  amortization and taxes depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in compared to  due to a higher level of plant in service and accelerated write off of electric generating assets  due to electric utility industry restructuring in massachusetts 
the electric generating assets will be fully amortized in approximately nine years 
in addition  the company has incurred higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to usource in compared to federal and state income taxes decreased by million  or  in compared to this result reflects lower net income before taxes and a lower level of investment tax credit amortization 
local property and other taxes decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease was related to local property tax changes 
interest expense interest expense  net decreased million  or  in compared to the prior year 
higher short term borrowing rates and a higher level of debt outstanding were offset by an increase in accrued interest income associated with deferred rate recovery mechanisms 
investments during and  unitil acquired an approximate equity interest in enermetrix  formerly known as north american power brokers  inc the total investment is recorded at cost on the balance sheet as other property and investments and is approximately million 
enermetrix is a privately held company that has been financed by four rounds of private equity capital 
unitil has participated in three of these rounds of financing 
enermetrix  a software provider and technology enabler  developed an internet based energy procurement bid system  the enermetrix network  that matches buyers and sellers of energy in competitive markets 
unitil is represented on the enermetrix board of directors 
although the market value of the investment in enermetrix stock is not readily determinable  management believes the fair value of this investment currently exceeds its cost 
capital requirements and liquidity unitil requires capital for the addition of property  plant  and equipment in order to improve  protect  maintain  and expand its electric and gas distribution systems  and to pursue its non regulated business initiatives and opportunities 
the capital necessary to meet these requirements has been derived primarily from the company s retained earnings and sale of shares of common stock through the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
when internally generated funds are not available  it is the company s policy to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the capital requirements of its subsidiaries and  when necessary  to repay short term debt through the issuance of long term debt financing 
cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in  after increasing by million in the decrease in was primarily a result of higher levels of accrued revenues  due to higher energy costs not immediately collected from customers 
also contributing to the decrease were higher levels of accounts receivable and deferred taxes 
cash flows from operating activities have been negatively impacted by volatile energy markets 
there is an inherent lag between the period when energy costs increase and the period when the company is granted rate increases to offset those higher energy costs 
this lag results in the company having to pay its suppliers for the higher energy costs while collecting less than those costs from its customers 
during the collection lag period  the company s cash flow is negatively impacted and additional short term borrowings are necessary 
operating activities s cash provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million in  primarily reflecting cash proceeds of million received in from the sale of the company s interest in new haven harbor station in absent the effect of these sale proceeds  cash flows used in investing activities increased million in compared to  reflecting higher expenditures of million on distribution system additions and improvements and higher expenditures of million for usource software development and computer hardware 
these higher expenditures were offset by a decrease in investment activity related to enermetrix in  compared to capital expenditures are projected to decrease in to approximately million  primarily reflecting lower planned expenditures on the company s non regulated business activities 
investing activities s cash used in investing activities cash flows from financing activities increased by million in compared to this increase reflects a higher level of borrowing in versus during  the company used proceeds from short term borrowings to fund a portion of its additions to property  plant  and equipment  its non regulated business activities  and a portion of its energy supply costs that exceeded amounts billed to customers via existing electricity and gas supply cost recovery mechanisms 
this time lag between increases in energy costs and corresponding rate increases  as discussed previously  results in the company incurring short term debt to fund  on an interim basis  the company s energy cost obligations 
concord electric company ceco and exeter hampton electric company e h received regulatory approval to increase fuel and purchased power rates as of january  fg e received regulatory approval for an increase on november   in its cost of gas adjustment charge cgac  followed by a second increase on february  fg e also received regulatory approval for an increase in its fuel index adjustment under its standard offer service tariff to electric customers  effective on january  these rate increases are expected to ease the need for higher levels of short term borrowings 
during  the company raised million of additional common equity capital through the issuance of  shares of common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans 
no options were exercised in under the company s key employee stock option plan kesop 
financing activities s cash from financing activities regulatory matters the unitil system of companies is regulated by various federal and state agencies  including the securities and exchange commission sec  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  and state regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the utility industry  including the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc and the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte 
in recent years  there has been significant legislative and regulatory activity to introduce greater competition in the supply and sale of electricity and gas  while continuing to regulate the delivery and distribution operations of our utility subsidiaries 
massachusetts enacted comprehensive electric utility industry restructuring in november since march   all electric consumers in massachusetts served by investor owned utilities have had the ability to choose their electric energy supplier 
fg e  the company s massachusetts utility operating subsidiary  continues to implement its comprehensive electric restructuring plan and divestiture of its entire regulated power supply business  including its nuclear investment 
since  fg e has worked in collaboration with the other massachusetts gas distribution utilities and various other stakeholders to develop and implement the infrastructure to offer gas customers choice of their competitive gas energy supplier and to complete the restructuring of gas service provided by gas utilities 
fg e filed with the mdte new gas tariffs to implement natural gas unbundling in accordance with model terms and conditions resulting from these collaborative efforts 
the mdte issued an order approving these tariffs and final regulations effective november  in new hampshire  ceco and e h  our electric utility operating subsidiaries  and unitil power corp  our wholesale power company  continue to prepare for the transition that will move them into this new market structure  pending resolution of certain key restructuring policies and issues 
the utility operating companies have also been active participants in the restructuring of the wholesale power market and transmission system in new england 
though retail competition in the sale of electricity has stalled throughout the region  new wholesale markets have been implemented in the new england power pool nepool under the general supervision of an independent system operator iso 
massachusetts electric restructuring on january   the mdte approved fg e s restructuring plan with certain modifications 
the plan provides customers with a the ability to choose an energy supplier  b an option to purchase standard offer service provided by fg e at regulated rates for up to seven years  and c a cumulative rate reduction adjusted for inflation 
the order also approved fg e s power supply divestiture plan for its interest in three generating units and four long term power supply contracts 
pursuant to the plan  on october   fg e filed a proposed contract with constellation power services inc for provision of standard offer service 
constellation began to supply power under that contract on march   and is scheduled to continue through february  the award of this contract was the first successful standard offer auction conducted in massachusetts 
a contract for the sale of fg e s interest in the new haven harbor plant was approved by the mdte on march   and the sale of the unit closed on april  a contract for the sale of the entire output from fg e s remaining generating assets and purchased power contracts to select energy  inc was approved by the mdte on december   and went into effect february  on december   fg e filed with the mdte new rates for effect january  the revised rates maintain the required inflation adjusted rate discount 
the mdte approved the rates on january   subject to an examination of the company s filing in which it reconciles its estimated and actual transition costs the reconciliation filing 
on february   the mdte initiated a proceeding to examine fg e s reconciliation filing and the consistency of the proposed charges and adjustments with the methods approved in fg e s restructuring plan 
the mdte held four days of hearings in may  and the company presented testimony in support of its filing 
as part of his review of fg e s filing  the massachusetts attorney general has challenged fg e s recovery of certain transition costs and other cost reconciliation calculations 
management is unable to determine the outcome of the mdte proceedings 
however  if an unfavorable outcome were to occur  there could be an adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
as a result of restructuring and divestiture of fg e s generation and purchased power portfolio  fg e has accelerated the write off of its electric generation assets and its abandoned investment in seabrook station 
the mdte established the return to be earned on the unamortized balance of fg e s generation plant  reducing fg e s earnings on those assets 
in  unitil s earnings from this business segment represented approximately of the earnings from utility operations 
as this portfolio is amortized over the next years  earnings from this segment of fg e s utility business will continue to decline and ultimately cease 
on august   fg e was the first electric company in massachusetts to file for an increase in its standard offer service rates pursuant to the fuel adjustment provision of its standard offer service sos tariff 
this adjustment allows an increase in the sos rate due to increases in the fuel prices of oil and natural gas 
any revenues received as a result of this adjustment are passed on to the company s wholesale sos provider 
the mdte suspended the filing for further review 
subsequently  other electric utility companies operating in massachusetts made similar filings  and the mdte instituted proceedings in each of those cases 
on december   the mdte issued an order for the utilities authorizing a fixed fuel adjustment  calculated based on the most recent months of data 
these adjustments took effect on january  fg e s sos rate increased from cents kwh to cents kwh 
unrecovered amounts to date will be recovered  subject to the rate reduction requirements of the act 
in approving the new sos rates  the mdte also directed all electric distribution companies to file a report with the mdte on their efforts to mitigate transition costs 
on january   fg e filed an extensive report detailing its mitigation activities  including contract restructurings  divestiture of its generating assets  and a variety of initiatives intended to reduce the burden of increasing energy prices on customers 
while fg e has substantially completed the divestiture of its generation assets  the company continues to seek ways to reduce its transition costs and lower prices for customers 
on december   fg e filed new electric rates for effect january  the revised rates maintain the required inflation adjusted rate discount 
the mdte approved final rates on december   subject to reconciliation pursuant to an investigation of actual and estimated transition costs  resulting in an upward inflation adjustment of relative to rates 
new customers  and customers who previously opted to take electric supply service from a competitive provider  may purchase power through fg e under default service 
fg e provides the default service through a third party supplier at market based rates 
the company issued a request for proposals for default service in september fg e awarded a contract and filed resulting rates which were approved effective for the period january through may in june  the mdte opened an investigation into whether metering  meter maintenance and testing  and customer billing and information services mbis should be unbundled  and the service territories of distribution companies should remain exclusive 
on december   the mdte issued its report recommending that the legislature not take action to allow for the competitive provision of mbis in the electric industry 
the mdte also concluded that exclusive service territories should remain intact 
massachusetts gas restructuring in mid  the mdte directed all massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies ldcs to form a collaborative with other stakeholders to develop common principles and appropriate regulations for the unbundling of gas service  and directed fg e and four other ldcs to file unbundled gas rates for its review 
fg e s unbundled gas rates were filed with  and approved by  the mdte and implemented in november on february   the mdte issued an order in which it determined that the ldcs would continue to have an obligation to provide gas supply and delivery services for another five years  with a review after three years 
this order also set forth the mdte s decision requiring mandatory assignment by ldcs of their pipeline capacity contracts to competitive marketers 
in march  the ldcs and other stakeholders filed a settlement with the mdte  which set forth rules for implementing an interim firm transportation service through october  the mdte approved the settlement on april  fg e has made separate compliance filings that were approved by the mdte to implement its interim firm gas transportation service for its largest general service customers and to complement this service with a firm gas peaking service 
this interim service is now superseded by the permanent transportation service  which was approved for implementation on november  on november   the massachusetts ldcs filed model terms and conditions for gas service  including provisions for capacity assignment  peaking service  and default service 
in accordance with the mdte s approval of these model terms and conditions in january  fg e filed company specific tariffs that implement natural gas unbundling 
the mdte also opened a rulemaking proceeding on proposed regulations that would govern the unbundling of services related to the provision of natural gas 
the mdte has issued an order approving the tariffs and final regulations effective november  new hampshire electric restructuring on february   the nhpuc issued its final plan for new hampshire electric utilities to transition to a competitive electric market in the state final plan 
the final plan linked the interim recovery of stranded cost by the state s utilities to a comparison of their existing rates with the regional average utility rates 
ceco s and e h s rates are below the regional average  thus  the nhpuc found that ceco and e h were entitled to full interim stranded cost recovery  as defined by the nhpuc 
however  the nhpuc also made certain legal rulings which could affect ceco s and e h s long term ability to recover all of their stranded costs 
northeast utilities affiliate public service company of new hampshire psnh filed suit in us district court for protection from the final plan and related orders and was granted an indefinite stay 
in june  unitil  and other utilities in new hampshire  intervened as plaintiffs in the federal court proceeding 
in june  the federal court clarified that the injunctions issued by the court in had effectively frozen the nhpuc s efforts to implement restructuring 
this amended injunction has been challenged by the nhpuc  and affirmed by the first circuit court of appeals 
unitil continues to be a plaintiff intervenor in federal district court 
further court proceedings are pending final resolution of electric restructuring for psnh 
unitil has continued to work actively to explore settlement options and to seek a fair and reasonable resolution of key restructuring policies and issues in new hampshire 
the company is also monitoring the regulatory and legislative proceedings dealing with electric restructuring in the state 
in october  the nhpuc approved a settlement for the restructuring of psnh 
appeals of the psnh restructuring orders were denied by the new hampshire supreme court and are now being pursued with the us supreme court 
pending rate proceedings the last formal regulatory filings to increase base electric rates for unitil s three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in for ceco  for fg e  and for e h 
a majority of the company s operating revenues are collected under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including fuel  purchased power  cost of gas  energy efficiency  and restructuring related cost recovery mechanisms 
industry restructuring will continue to change the methods of how certain costs are recovered through the company s regulated rates and tariffs 
as discussed above  fg e filed for and received approval of an increase to its electric standard offer service rate reflecting extraordinary increases in the price of oil and natural gas 
fg e also received an increase to its cost of gas adjustment resulting in bill increases of approximately  effective november  fg e subsequently received another increase of approximately to its cost of gas adjustment for effect february  wholesale natural gas prices reached record levels in new england and across the united states in response to cold weather and tight supplies 
in new hampshire  ceco and e h filed and received approval of increases to their fuel and purchased power adjustments  resulting in bill increases of to  depending upon usage patterns  effective january  these higher fuel costs are a pass through without markup or profit 
retail electricity prices for most new england utilities are increasing this winter 
on may   fg e filed a gas base rate case with the mdte 
the last base rate case had been in after evidentiary hearings  the mdte issued an order allowing fg e to establish new rates  effective november   that would produce an annual increase of approximately million in gas revenues 
as part of the proceeding  the massachusetts attorney general alleged that fg e had double collected fuel inventory finance charges  and requested that the mdte require fg e to refund approximately million in double collections since the company believes that the attorney general s claim is without merit and that a refund was not justified or warranted 
the mdte rejected the attorney general s request and stated its intent to open a separate proceeding to investigate the attorney general s claim 
on november   the mdte issued an order of notice initiating an investigation of this matter 
hearings were held in early and were reopened in november to hear new evidence 
supplemental testimony has been filed and additional hearings were held in february on october   the mdte initiated a proceeding to implement performance based rate making pbr for all electric and gas distribution utilities in massachusetts 
pbr is a method of setting regulated distribution rates that provide incentives for utilities to control costs while maintaining a high level of service quality 
under pbr  a company s earnings are tied to performance targets  and penalties can be imposed for deterioration of service quality 
on december   fg e filed a petition with the mdte for authority to defer for later recovery costs associated with its preparation of a pbr filing for its gas division and its participation in the mdte initiated generic gas and electric pbr proceedings 
this petition and the mdte s generic proceeding are pending 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that pbr would have on the company s ability to continue applying the standards of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
on december   the massachusetts attorney general filed a complaint against fg e requesting that the mdte investigate the distribution rates  rate of return  and depreciation accrual rates for fg e s electric operations in calendar year the mdte opened a proceeding in november  held a public hearing and procedural conference in december  and subsequently issued a procedural schedule covering the period january through april any order received from the mdte would apply to the company s rates prospectively and would not be retroactive 
management is unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding but an unfavorable result could have an adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
millstone unit no 
fg e has a nonoperating ownership in the millstone unit no 
millstone nuclear generating unit which supplies it with megawatts mw of electric capacity 
in january  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc placed millstone on its watch list  which calls for increased nrc inspection attention 
in march  as a result of engineering evaluations  millstone was taken out of service 
the nrc authorized the restart of millstone in june during the period that millstone was out of service  fg e continued to incur its proportionate share of the unit s ongoing operations and maintenance o m costs  and may incur additional o m costs and capital expenditures to meet nrc requirements 
fg e also incurred costs to replace the power that was expected to be generated by the unit 
during the outage  fg e incurred approximately million in replacement power costs  and recovered those costs through its electric fuel charge  which is subject to review and reconciliation by the mdte 
under existing mdte precedent  fg e s replacement power costs of million could be subject to disallowance in rates 
in august  fg e  in concert with other non operating joint owners  filed a demand for arbitration in connecticut and a lawsuit in massachusetts  in an effort to recover costs associated with the extended unplanned shutdown 
several preliminary rulings have been issued in the arbitration and legal cases  and both cases are continuing 
on march   fg e entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants under which fg e will dismiss its lawsuit and arbitration claims 
the settlement is generally similar to earlier settlements with the defendants  and three joint owners that own  in the aggregate  approximately of the unit 
the settlement provides for fg e to receive an initial payment of  and other amounts contingent upon future events and would result in fg e s entire interest in the unit being included in the auction of the majority interest  and certain of the minority interests  in millstone  which is expected to be completed by upon completion of the sale of millstone  fg e will be relieved of all residual liabilities  including decommissioning liabilities  associated with millstone fg e expects to flow through the net proceeds of the settlement to its customers 
on september   western massachusetts electric company  new england power company  and fg e together filed a joint petition requesting approval by the mdte of the sale of their respective interests in millstone units   and the companies also requested mdte findings that the divested assets qualify as eligible facilities pursuant to section c of the public utility holding company act of the mdte approved the sale and certified the unit as an eligible facility on december  the parties to the sale transaction are currently awaiting other state and federal regulatory approvals for the final sale of the millstone units 
environmental matters the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to identify and assess environmental issues at the former manufactured gas plant mgp site at sawyer passway  located in fitchburg  massachusetts 
fg e has proceeded with site remediation work as specified on the tier b permit  which allows fg e to work towards temporary remediation of the site 
in april  fg e applied for a utility related abatement measure uram with the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep to permit excavation work required to construct a new electric substation on fg e s former mgp site at sawyer passway 
the permit application was reviewed and approved by the massachusetts dep in may all work permitted under the provisions of the uram was completed and a final report of closure was submitted to the dep in december construction of the new highway bridge across sawyer passway began in october fg e began fulfillment of obligations associated with the bridge construction as stipulated in a memorandum of understanding with the massachusetts highway department and the massachusetts dep 
upon completion of site remediation associated with the bridge construction  the last remaining portion of the sawyer passway mgp site is expected to be closed out and attain the status of temporary closure in late this temporary closure requires fg e to monitor the site until a feasible permanent remediation alternative can be developed and completed 
the costs of remedial action at this site are initially funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the mdte 
the company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site 
market risk although unitil s utility operating companies are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of fuel and gas costs in rates 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
as the utility industry deregulates  the company will be divesting its commodity related energy businesses and therefore will be further reducing its exposure to commodity related risk 
forward looking information this report contains forward looking statements which are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  variations in weather  changes in the regulatory environment  customers preferences on energy sources  general economic conditions  increased competition and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict  and many of which are beyond the control of the company
