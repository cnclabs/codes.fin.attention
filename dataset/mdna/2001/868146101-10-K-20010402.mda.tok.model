item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we conduct our business in two segments through our primary operating subsidiary  superior consultant company  inc superior 
we are a leading provider of digital business transformation tm services primarily to the healthcare industry  connecting online technologies to business processes that have traditionally been conducted offline 
we provide all sectors of the industry with an integrated suite of advisory  solution centric and process improvement consulting services and information technology outsourcing 
prior to october   we were organized into the three business segments of consulting  outsourcing and e health 
effective october  we organized into the two business segments of consulting and outsourcing 
the consulting segment provides information technology  as well as strategic and operations management consulting  solutions and application support to a broad cross section of healthcare industry participants and information systems vendors 
we also assist clients to leverage the power  speed and value of internet technologies to achieve efficiencies in business and operations  realize measurable return on investment  connect with consumers  physicians and trading partners and provide total solutions in business to business and business to consumer e commerce 
from strategic planning and go to market strategies to internet enabling and development  integration and implementation  we assist our clients to achieve supply chain efficiencies  accelerate revenue and manage clinical content 
the outsourcing segment helps healthcare providers simplify their management agendas  improve their return on information systems investment and strengthen their technology management by ensuring client access to an outsourcer s ability to deliver higher quality at lower cost and help them avoid certain capital expenses 
the outsourcing segment offers the client an array of services  functions and economic elements that can be tailored to the specific client program agenda  including it management  it planning and budgeting  applications support  applications implementation  it operations  network and financial management and risk sharing 
during and  we continued to expand our e commerce  solution sales and systems integration capabilities 
as healthcare and other sectors move increasingly to internet and web based technologies and applications and as we continue to innovate services and solutions to develop and capitalize on this growing market  we will incur risks related to our participation in such untested opportunities  markets and quickly evolving lines of business 
such risks can include  but are not limited to  new and unforeseen technologies superseding development of the internet and or the systems integration platforms in which we invest  the e commerce and or systems integration markets taking turns not foreseen by us and adverse to the positioning and investments undertaken by us  slowness of traditional healthcare clients to adopt new technologies  and increased competition for consultant talent in the e commerce field  increasing our cost of providing services 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from fees for professional services 
we establish standard billing guidelines based on the type and level of service offered 
actual billing rates are established on a project by project basis and may vary from the standard guidelines 
billings for time and materials engagements are generally contracted to be made on a bi weekly basis to monitor client satisfaction and manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are provided 
billings for fixed fee projects and pre packaged solution sales are billed by deliverable or on a periodic basis  generally monthly 
we recognize revenue on fixed fee projects in a manner similar to the percentage of completion basis 
increased use of fixed fee contracts subjects us to increased risks  including cost overruns 
for outsourcing engagements  we recognize revenue in the amount billable under the contract  which is typically billable on a monthly basis 
as of december   we have seven significant contracts to provide healthcare it outsourcing services 
in addition  we provide help desk and call center support  typically billable on a per seat per month basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profit margins on outsourcing and support contracts which are consistent with our historical levels of profitability 
in our consulting segment  we also derive revenues from fees generated from our digital business transformation tm partnerships 
this revenue is generally recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
we seek to increase revenue through various means  including an increase in the number of projects for existing and new clients and expanded geographic presence 
in addition  we seek to increase revenues by expanding our range of specialty services with a focus on opportunities arising from the demand for internet  system security and hipaa expertise 
we manage our client development efforts through client partner organizations having specific geographic responsibility and focus 
our most significant expense is cost of services  which consists primarily of consultant salaries and benefits 
in recent years  consultant compensation expense has grown faster than consultant billing rates  resulting in an increase in our cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
this trend may or may not continue depending on whether competition for recruiting and retaining skilled consultants intensifies  particularly in the area of e commerce services 
we have sought to address this issue by adding an additional variable portion of compensation payable upon the achievement of measurable performance goals 
in addition  we have sought to address compensation expense pressures through increased use of stock options as an overall part of our compensation package 
these efforts have been hampered by the impact of our current stock price 
our cost of services as a percentage of revenues is also impacted by our consultant utilization 
we attempt to optimize utilization by monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consultants assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project terminations  completions and scheduling delays have and can result in periods when consultants are not fully utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant project has and can cause us to experience lower consultant utilization  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants 
during  the healthcare industry experienced a slow down in consulting expenditures as fiscal constraints imposed by factors such as the balanced budget act and lingering yk transition effects combined forces to dampen overall industry demand for new it service consulting projects 
these factors were coupled with a lengthening in the outsourcing sales cycle 
furthermore  the balanced budget act continues to adversely affect the financial stability of our clients and may impact their ability to pay for professional services rendered 
in addition  our establishment of new competency centers  services and market offerings and hiring of consultants in peak hiring periods have and can from time to time adversely affect utilization 
for example  we intend to grow our e commerce services to capture increased client demand expected to occur in this area and this growth will impact utilization as this new area comes online 
also  seasonal factors  such as vacation days and total business days in a quarter  as well as the timing of our annual employees meeting have and can result in lower consultant utilization 
variations in market offering solution sales and consultant utilization can also result in quarterly variability of our cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
our consultants are generally employed on a full time basis and therefore we will  in the short run  incur substantially all of our employee related costs even during periods of low utilization  as the majority of employment costs of these personnel are fixed 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of recruiting  training and re training  continuing education  marketing  facilities  administration  including compensation and benefits  outside professional fees  charges related to the accounts receivable allowance  litigation and claims  equipment depreciation and amortization of goodwill 
during the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   we experienced a decline in demand for our services 
during the year ended december   we implemented a restructuring plan  which was endorsed by our board of directors 
the restructuring plan was aimed at improving future overall financial performance through operating cost reductions and the optimization of our work force 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we reduced quarterly operating expenses by million from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of and additional reductions are expected in we incurred one time restructuring charges of approximately million during the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues

the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter because our sales cycle can be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments  the general ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  long sales cycles for outsourcing engagements and general economic conditions 
in addition  the timing of the establishment of new competency centers  market offerings  geographic expansion and the hiring of key individuals can also have an effect on consultant utilization 
seasonal factors such as vacation days  total business days in a quarter or the business practices of clients  such as deferred commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar or the client s fiscal year  can cause us to experience lower consultant utilization 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number or size of client assignments or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparison of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance as no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions
