impact of inflation management believes that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations 
the company believes that it can offset inflationary increases in the cost of materials and labor by increasing sales prices and improving operating efficiencies 
risks and uncertainties the following risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the company s business  operating results  financial results and future prospects 
the company has been party to significant breast implant litigation in the past and may be party to this type of litigation in the future the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims alleging that the use of its technology or products has resulted in adverse health effects 
the risks of litigation exist even with respect to products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
if the company is unable to avoid significant product liability claims  its business could be materially harmed 
in particular  the manufacture and sale of breast implant products entails significant risk of product liability claims due to potential allegations of possible disease transmission and other health factors  rupture or other product failure and product recalls 
see legal proceedings section 
the company s products expose it to liabilities that may not be adequately covered by insurance and the company s financial results may suffer in addition to the risks the company faces from product liability claims  the company is subject to the inherent risk that a government authority or third party may require the company to recall one or more of its products 
the company has liability insurance that would cover a claim relating to the use or recall of its products under a limited number of circumstances 
in addition  one or more product liability claims against the company could exceed its insurance coverage 
in the event liability insurance would not sufficiently cover a product liability claim or recall  these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
adequate product liability insurance may not continue to be available  either at existing or increased levels of coverage  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
even if a claim is covered by insurance  the costs of defending a product liability  negligence or other action  and the assessment of damages in excess of insurance coverage  could entail significant expense and damage the company s reputation 
the company cannot assure you that its insurance will be broad enough to protect the company against all future claims  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is a party to worldwide litigation and claims arising from the trilucent breast implant and its reserves and insurance may be inadequate to cover these expenses the company faces substantial expenses for the cost of explantations  potential and actual bodily injury claims and other expenses relating to the trilucent breast implant 
while the company believes it has a strong motion to dismiss certain of the us actions brought against it on grounds of inconvenient forum  these motions  of their nature  are addressed to the sound discretion of the court and could fail 
further  the company has been named in a putative class action brought by a us patient who obtained the trilucent implants in a clinical study 
that action is not susceptible to dismissal on grounds of inconvenient forum and  while each participant in the us and canadian clinical studies executed a broad informed consent as a condition to participation  those consents may not bar the maintenance of at least certain claims against the company which are not pre empted by federal law 
in addition  while the company has succeeded in negotiating a claims settlement protocol in the united kingdom  as an alternative to litigation there  women are free to opt out of this program and to bring individual actions for personal injuries and financial loss 
also  by operation of uk law  the release granted to the company under its settlement protocol is necessarily provisional  each participating claimant reserves the right to pursue a future claim against the company should she develop cancer or reproductive abnormalities 
in addition  the company will have trilucent related liability in other jurisdictions  in the european community and elsewhere 
to date  those expenses have been immaterial but they could grow in the future 
moreover  pursuant to agreements with the united kingdom medical devices agency  the company is currently funding trilucent related scientific research and patient monitoring  including a clinical follow up study in the uk the scientific research now being conducted by the trilucent advisory panel  in the areas of histopathology  genotoxicity and adduct formation  among others  or future research performed by this or another panel  could reveal that the risk to human health of the trilucent implant is greater than is currently believed 
thus  although the company had reserves at december  of million and product liability and medical expense reimbursement insurance of in excess of million  these reserves and insurance policies may be inadequate to cover all known and unknown trilucent related contingent liabilities 
in addition  the insurance companies that are funding these policies are doing so subject to various reservations of rights 
they could seek to recoup  and recoup  the amounts advanced in further litigation with the company 
negative publicity concerning the safety of our products could harm sales or result in product withdrawals whether such publicity has a basis in generally accepted scientific fact or not physicians and potential patients may have a number of concerns about the safety of our products  including our breast implants and collagen based facial injections  whether such concerns have a basis in generally accepted science or peer reviewed scientific research or not 
the responses of potential and actual patients  surgeons and physicians  legislative  regulatory and or other government actors  members of the news media and or others to information about actual  potential or imagined complications from the company s products  such as information concerning bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse and or creutzfeldt jacob disease  could result in negative publicity  could materially reduce market acceptance of its products and or could result in product withdrawals  on the basis of accepted scientific doctrine  the precautionary principle  speculation or otherwise 
these responses or investigations  and potential resulting negative publicity  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operations and prospects and or on the market price of the company s stock 
in addition  significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims against the company  whether they have a basis in scientific fact or not 
the company s quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations and should not be relied on as an indication of the company s future results the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond its control 
these factors include demand for the company s products  which historically has been the highest in the second quarter  the company s ability to meet the demand for its products  increased competition  the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by the company and its competitors  the company s ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of its products on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  the timing of significant orders and shipments  and general economic factors 
based upon all of the foregoing  the company believes that quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
changes in the economy and consumer spending could adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products breast augmentations and collagen based implants and injections are elective procedures 
other than us federally mandated insurance reimbursement for post mastectomy reconstructive surgery  breast augmentations and other cosmetic procedures are not typically covered by insurance 
significant or incremental adverse changes in the overall pace of the economy or the perception that such changes are occurring or are about to occur may cause consumers to reassess their spending choices and reduce the demand for cosmetic surgery 
this shift could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and could materially harm the company s business 
if the company is unable to continue to develop and market new products  and technologies  the company may experience a decrease in demand for its products or its products could become obsolete the company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is obtaining the applicable regulatory approvals and marketing the new product quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in medical technologies  without compromising product quality 
the company is continually engaged in product development and improvement programs 
the company cannot assure you that it will be successful in enhancing existing products or developing new products or technologies that will timely achieve regulatory approval or receive market acceptance 
the company depends on a single supplier for its silicone raw materials and the loss of this supplier could adversely affect the company s ability to manufacture many of its products the company currently relies on a single supplier for silicone raw materials used in many of its products 
although the company has an agreement with this supplier to transfer the necessary formulations to the company in the event that this supplier cannot meet its requirements  the company cannot assure you that it will be able to timely produce a sufficient amount of quality silicone raw materials  if at all 
the loss of this supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s ability to sell bovine collagen based products could be adversely affected if the company experiences problems with the closed herd of domestic cattle from which it derives these products the company relies on two closed herds of domestic cattle that are kept apart from all other cattle for the production of its bovine collagen based products 
in the event of material diminution in the size of these herds  the company would have a limited ability to quickly increase its supply of acceptable cattle and bovine based products from a similarly segregated source 
the diminution in size or infection of the company s cattle could have a material adverse effect on its ability to sell bovine collagen based products and  as a result  a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operations or prospects 
the company s international business exposes it to a number of risks more than one third of the company s net sales are derived from international operations 
accordingly  any material decrease in foreign sales may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of the company s international sales are denominated in us dollars  euros or yen 
depreciation or devaluation of the local currencies of countries where the company sells its products may result in its products becoming more expensive in local currency terms  thus reducing demand 
the company manufactures some of its breast implant products in ireland and began manufacturing some breast implant products in costa rica in late therefore  some of the company s operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company cannot assure you that it will not experience unfavorable currency fluctuation effects in future periods  which could have an adverse effect on its operating results 
the company s operations and financial results also may be significantly affected by other international factors  including the imposition of additional foreign government controls or regulations on medical devices  new export license requirements  political instability  inflation or negative economic growth in the company s target markets  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  and difficulties in managing international operations 
the company is subject to substantial government regulation  which could materially adversely affect its business the production and marketing of the company s products and its ongoing research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the us and abroad 
most of the medical devices the company develops must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process administered by the food and drug administration under the food  drug  and cosmetic act and comparable foreign authorities before they can be marketed 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that the company wishes to market in the us must receive either a k clearance or a premarket approval pma from the fda 
in order to be commercially distributed throughout the european community  a medical device must bear a ce conformity marking  indicating that it conforms with the essential requirements of the applicable european medical devices directive 
these regulations govern the testing  marketing and registration of new medical devices  in addition to regulating manufacturing practices  labeling and record keeping procedures 
this process makes it longer  harder and more costly to bring the company s products to market  and the company cannot assure you that any of its products will be approved 
if the company does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can result in warning letters  non approval  suspensions of regulatory approvals  civil penalties and criminal fines  product seizures and recalls  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
delays in or rejection of fda approval of the company s products may be encountered due to  among other reasons  regulatory review of each new device application or product license application the company submit  as well as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development both in the us and abroad 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  this approval may entail limitations on uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted 
further  for a marketed product  its manufacturer and the facilities in which the product is manufactured are subject to continual review and inspection 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market or other enforcement actions 
future legislation or regulations relating to the company or its products could materially adversely affect the company s business if any national healthcare reform or other legislation or regulations are passed that impose limits on the number or type of medical procedures that may be performed or that have the effect of restricting a physician s ability to select specific products for use in his or her procedures  it could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s products 
in the us  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state legislative proposals and regulations to implement greater governmental control on the healthcare industry 
these proposals create uncertainty as to the future of the company s industry and may have a material adverse effect on its ability to raise capital or to form collaborations  and the enactment of these reforms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in a number of foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of healthcare products are subject to governmental influence or control 
in addition  legislation or regulations that impose restrictions on the price that may be charged for healthcare products or medical devices may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  legislation or regulatory proposals are introduced and discussed which could alter the review and approval process relating to medical device products 
historically  the company s stock price has been volatile and its trading volume has been low the market prices for securities of medical device companies have historically been highly volatile 
broad market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
the trading price of the company s common stock has been  and may be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include quarter to quarter variations in the company s operating results  the results of testing  technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or its competitors  governmental regulations  rules and orders  general conditions in the healthcare  medical device or plastic surgery industries  changes in the company s earnings estimates by securities analysts  developments concerning patents or other proprietary rights  and litigation or public concern about the safety of the company s products 
historically  the daily trading volume of the company s common stock was relatively low 
on september   the company s common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market 
since that time  the average trading volume of the company s common stock has increased 
the company cannot assure you that an active public market for its common stock will be sustained or that the average trading volume will remain at present levels or increase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of financing  and operations of the company 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december  primarily variable rate debt  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of may   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
during the year the company entered into agreements converting approximately million of floating rate debt to fixed rate to hedge interest rate exposures 
the company s foreign currency risk exposure results form fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the european currencies 
the company faces transactional currency exposures that arise when its foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
the company also faces currency exposure that arises from translating the results of its global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
generally  the company has not used financial derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
based on the company s overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a hypothetical percent change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on the company s balance sheet  net sales  net income or cash flows over a one year period 
from time to time the company enters into agreements to hedge certain foreign currency exposures on commitments 
there were no significant open positions at year end
