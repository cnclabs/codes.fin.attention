cerulean  principally through its blue cross and blue shield of georgia subsidiary  offers insured and administrative services products primarily in the state of georgia 
cerulean has historically experienced a higher administrative expense ratio than the company s core businesses due to its higher concentration of administrative services business 
cerulean has also historically experienced a higher medical loss ratio than the company s core businesses due to its higher percentage of large employer group business and fewer managed care offerings

the cerulean  rush prudential and precisionrx acquisitions are each components of this expansion strategy 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company has significantly expanded its operations outside of california 
in order to integrate its acquired businesses and implement the company s regional expansion strategy  the company will need to develop satisfactory networks of hospitals  physicians and other health care service providers  develop distribution channels for its products and successfully convert acquired books of business to the company s existing information systems  which will require continued investments by the company

in connection with the introduction of these plans  the company has announced that it will not increase premiums for certain members during portions of these plan changes will not affect any of the company s ppo plans under employer sponsored arrangements 
in response to rising medical and pharmacy costs  the company has from time to time implemented premium increases with respect to certain of its products 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for further premium increases  plan design changes and other appropriate actions in the future in order to maintain or restore profit margins 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will be able to take subsequent pricing or other actions or that any actions previously taken or implemented in the future will be successful in addressing any concerns that may arise with respect to the performance of certain businesses

in  texas adopted legislation purporting to make managed care organizations such as the company liable for their failure to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions

factors that may affect future results of operations certain statements contained herein  such as statements concerning potential or future loss ratios  the effects as the company continues to integrate its recently acquired operations and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as such term is defined in the securities exchange act of 
such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those projected 
factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those discussed from time to time in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal  state and local agencies in all jurisdictions in which the company operates 
many of these agencies have increased their scrutiny of managed health care companies in recent periods or are expected to increase their scrutiny  as newly passed legislation becomes effective 
from time to time  the company and its subsidiaries receive requests for information from regulatory agencies or are notified that such agencies are conducting reviews  investigations or other proceedings with respect to certain of the company s activities 
the company also provides insurance products to medi cal beneficiaries in various california counties under contracts with the california department of health services or delegated local agencies and provides administrative services to the health care finance administration hcfa in various capacities 
there can be no assurance that acting as a government contractor in these circumstances will not increase the risk of heightened scrutiny by such government agencies or that such scrutiny will not have a material adverse effect on the company  either through negative publicity about the company or through an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  profitability from this business may be adversely affected through inadequate premium rate increases due to governmental budgetary issues 
future actions by any regulatory agencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in connection with the cerulean transaction  wellpoint incurred significant indebtedness to fund the transaction 
this indebtedness may result in a significant percentage of the company s cash flow being applied to the payment of interest  and there can be no assurance that the company s operations will generate sufficient cash flow to service the indebtedness 
this indebtedness  as well as any indebtedness the company may incur in the future  may adversely affect the company s ability to finance its operations and could limit its ability to pursue business opportunities that may be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
as part of the company s business strategy  the company has acquired substantial operations in new geographic markets over the last five years 
these businesses  some of which include substantial indemnity based insurance operations  have experienced varying profitability or losses in recent periods 
since the relevant dates of acquisition of mmhd and gbo  the company has continued to work extensively on the integration of these businesses 
the company has also begun its integration of the rush prudential business 
the company expects to begin its integration of cerulean during the remainder of however  there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate success of the company s integration efforts or regarding the ability of the company to maintain or improve the results of operations of the businesses of completed or pending transactions as the company pursues its strategy of motivating the acquired members to select managed care products 
in order to implement this business strategy  the company has incurred and will  among other things  need to continue to incur considerable expenditures for provider networks  distribution channels and information systems in addition to the costs associated with the integration of these acquisitions 
the integration of these complex businesses may result in  among other things  temporary increases in claims inventory or other service related issues that may negatively affect the company s relationship with its customers and contribute to increased attrition of such customers 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the company experiences such problems or is otherwise unable to implement fully its expansion strategy 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to capital surplus requirements by the california department of managed health care  the georgia department of insurance  various other state departments of insurance and the blue cross blue shield association 
although the company believes that it is currently in compliance with all applicable requirements  there can be no assurances that such requirements will not be increased in the future 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings  many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business 
the company  like hmos and health insurers generally  excludes certain health care services from coverage under its hmo  ppo and other plans 
the company is  in its ordinary course of business  subject to the claims of its enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict treatment or reimbursement for certain services 
the loss of even one such claim  if it results in a significant punitive damage award  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable settlements of coverage claims 
in june  the california medical association filed a lawsuit in us district court in san francisco against bcc 
the lawsuit alleges that bcc violated the rico act through various misrepresentations to and inappropriate actions against health care providers 
in late  a number of class action lawsuits were brought against several of the company s competitors alleging  among other things  various misrepresentations regarding their health plans and breaches of fiduciary obligations to health plan members 
in august  the company was added as a party to shane v 
humana  et al  a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of health care providers nationwide 
in addition to the rico claims brought in the california medical association lawsuit  this lawsuit also alleges violations of erisa  federal and state prompt pay regulations and certain common law claims 
in october  the federal judicial panel on multidistrict litigation issued an order consolidating the california medical association lawsuit  the shane lawsuit and various other pending managed care class action lawsuits against other companies before district court judge federico moreno in the southern district of florida for purposes of the pretrial proceedings 
in march  judge moreno dismissed the plaintiffs claims based on violation of the rico act  although the dismissal was made without prejudice to the plaintiffs ability to subsequently refile their claims 
judge moreno also dismissed  with prejudice  the plaintiffs federal prompt pay law claims 
the company currently expects that a hearing on the plaintiffs motion to certify a class will be held in early may on march   the california medical association filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit  alleging  among other things  revised rico claims and violations of california law 
the financial and operational impact that these and other evolving theories of recovery will have on the managed care industry generally  or the company in particular  is at present unknown 
the company s future results will depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs incurred on existing business and upon the company s ability to control future health care costs through product and benefit design  underwriting criteria  utilization management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
changes in mandated benefits  utilization rates  demographic characteristics  health care practices  provider consolidation  inflation  new pharmaceuticals technologies  clusters of high cost cases  the regulatory environment and numerous other factors are beyond the control of any health plan provider and may adversely affect the company s ability to predict and control health care costs and claims  as well as the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups may result in increased health care costs and limit the company s ability to negotiate favorable rates 
recently  large physician practice management companies have experienced extreme financial difficulties  including bankruptcy  which may subject the company to increased credit risk related to provider groups and cause the company to incur duplicative claims expense 
additionally  the company faces competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in connection with the introduction of new individual ppo plans in california in january  the company has announced that it will not raise premiums to certain members during portions of fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for these programs 
any limitation on the company s ability to increase or maintain its premium levels  design products  implement underwriting criteria or negotiate competitive provider contracts may adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
managed care organizations  both inside and outside california  operate in a highly competitive environment that has undergone significant change in recent years as a result of business consolidations  new strategic alliances  aggressive marketing practices by competitors and other market pressures 
additional increases in competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
additional increases in competition including competition from market entrants offering internet based products and services  could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
as a result of the company s acquisitions  the company operates on a select geographic basis nationally and offers a spectrum of health care and specialty products through various risk sharing arrangements 
the company s health care products include a variety of managed care offerings as well as traditional fee for service coverage 
with respect to product type  fee for service products are generally less profitable than managed care products 
a critical component of the company s expansion strategy is to transition over time the traditional insurance members of the company s acquired businesses to more managed care products 
with respect to the risk sharing nature of products  managed care products that involve greater potential risk to the company generally tend to be more profitable than management services products and those managed care products where the company is able to shift risks to employer groups 
individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase the company s higher risk managed care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures 
typically  government sponsored programs involve the company s higher risk managed care products 
over the past few years  the company has experienced a slight decline in margins in its higher risk managed care products and to a lesser extent on its lower risk managed care and management services products 
this decline is primarily attributable to product mix change  product design  competitive pressure and greater regulatory restrictions applicable to the small employer group market 
from time to time  the company has implemented price increases in certain of its managed care businesses 
while these price increases are intended to improve profitability  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
subsequent unfavorable changes in the relative profitability between the company s various products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and on the continued merits of the company s geographic expansion strategy 
substantially all of the company s investment assets are in interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities or equity securities 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
in addition  the value of equity securities can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions 
changes in the value of the company s investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  can affect the company s results of operations and stockholders equity 
there can be no assurances that interest rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the company s operations are dependent on retaining existing employees  attracting additional qualified employees and achieving productivity gains from the company s investment in technology 
the company faces intense competition for qualified information technology personnel and other skilled professionals 
there can be no assurances that an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in december  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company completed its acquisition of certain mail order pharmaceutical service assets and conducts business as a mail order pharmacy 
the pharmacy business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations which are in many instances different from those under which the company currently operates 
the failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
although the company intends to maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  there can be no assurances that the coverage limits under such insurance programs will be adequate to protect against future claims or that the company will be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company regularly evaluates its asset and liability interest rate risks as well as the appropriateness of investments relative to its internal investment guidelines 
the company operates within these guidelines by maintaining a well diversified portfolio  both across and within asset classes 
the company has retained an independent consultant to advise the company on the appropriateness of its investment policy and the compliance therewith 
asset interest rate risk is managed within a duration band tied to the company s liability interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by maintaining high average quality ratings and a well diversified portfolio 
the company s use of derivative instruments is generally limited to hedging purposes and has principally consisted of forward exchange contracts intended to minimize the portfolio s exposure to currency volatility associated with certain foreign currency denominated bond holdings 
the company s investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for leveraging purposes as well as the creation of risk exposures not otherwise allowed within the policy 
since  the company has from time to time entered into interest rate swap agreements primarily by exchanging the floating debt payments due under its outstanding indebtedness for fixed rate payments 
the company believes that this allows it to better anticipate its interest payments while helping to manage the asset liability relationship 
interest rate risk as of december   approximately of the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities maturing in more than one year 
of the remainder  was comprised of equities and was comprised of cash  which is not subject to interest rate risk  the value of which generally varies inversely with changes in interest rates 
the company has evaluated the net impact to the fair value of its fixed income investments from a hypothetical change in all interest rates of  and basis points bp 
in doing so  optionality was addressed through monte carlo simulation of the price behavior of securities with embedded options 
in addressing prepayments on mortgage backed securities  the model follows the normal market practice of estimating a non interest rate sensitive component primarily related to relocations and an interest sensitive component primarily related to refinancings separately 
the model is based on statistical techniques applied to historical prepayment and market data  and then incorporates forward looking mortgage market research and judgments about future prepayment behavior 
changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio are reflected in the balance sheet through stockholders equity 
under the requirements of sfas no 
 effective january   all derivative financial instruments will be reflected on the balance sheet at fair value 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources new accounting pronouncements 
the results of this analysis as of december  are reflected in the table below 
the table reflects the change in valuation of interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december  to the extent that the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements exceeded the principal balance of the company s floating rate indebtedness 
increase decrease in fair value given an interest rate increase of bp bp bp in millions fixed income portfolio valuation of interest rate swap agreements results as of december  are reflected in the table below 
the table reflects the change in valuation of interest rate swap agreements for the year ended december  to the extent that the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements exceeded the principal balance of the company s floating rate indebtedness 
increase decrease in fair value given an interest rate increase of bp bp bp in millions fixed income portfolio valuation of interest rate swap agreements the company believes that an interest rate shift in a month period of bp represents a moderately adverse outcome  while a bp shift is significantly adverse and a bp shift is unlikely given historical precedents 
although the company holds its bonds as available for sale for purposes of sfas no 
 the company s cash flows and the short duration of its investment portfolio should allow it to hold securities to maturity  thereby avoiding the recognition of losses  should interest rates rise significantly 
interest rate swap agreements the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to reduce the volatility of interest expense resulting from changes in interest rates 
as of december   the company had entered into million of floating to fixed rate swap agreements  which consist of a million notional amount swap agreement at and a million notional amount swap agreement at 
as of december   the company also had million of libor based floating rate debt outstanding 
the company also receives a libor based payment as a result of its swap arrangements  thereby eliminating the payment exposure to changes in interest rates on that million of outstanding debt 
in  the company entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to exchange three month libor the index associated with the aforementioned swap for one month libor the index associated with the revolving credit facility in order to hedge against rising interest rates at the end of the year 
this agreement matured february  equity price risk the company s equity securities are comprised primarily of domestic stocks as well as certain foreign holdings 
assuming an immediate decrease of in market value  as of december  and  the hypothetical loss in fair value of stockholders equity is estimated to be approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange risk the company has generally hedged the foreign exchange risk associated with its fixed income portfolio 
the company uses short term foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain fixed income securities denominated in foreign currencies 
therefore  the company believes that there is minimal risk to the fixed income portfolio due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s hedging program related to its foreign currency denominated investments is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not hedge its foreign exchange risk arising from equity investments denominated in foreign currencies 
assuming a foreign exchange loss of across all foreign equity investments  the net hypothetical pretax loss in fair value as of december  and  is estimated to be million and million  respectively
