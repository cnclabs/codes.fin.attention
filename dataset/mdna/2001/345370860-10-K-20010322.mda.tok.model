item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview we are exposed to a variety of market and asset risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates  and specific asset risks 
these risks affect our automotive and financial services sectors differently 
we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results 
the effect of changes in exchange rates  commodity prices  and interest rates on our earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as unit sales and operating margins 
for more information on these financial exposures  see notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the market risks of our automotive sector and the market and other risks and capital adequacy of ford credit  which comprises substantially all of our financial services sector  are discussed and quantified below 
automotive market risk our automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in affiliates 
these expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector 
foreign currency risk we use derivative financial instruments to hedge assets  liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging policy is defensive  based on clearly defined guidelines 
speculative actions are not permitted 
we do not use complex derivative instruments 
we use a value at risk var analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary assumptions used in the var analysis are as follows o a monte carlo simulation model is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments eg  forwards and options and all significant underlying exposures 
the var analysis includes an month exposure and derivative hedging horizon and a one month holding period 
o the var analysis calculates the potential risk  within a confidence level  on cross border currency cash flow exposures  including the effects of foreign currency derivatives 
translation exposures are not included in the var analysis 
the monte carlo simulation model uses historical volatility and correlation estimates of the underlying assets to produce a large number of future price scenarios which have a statistically lognormal distribution 
o estimates of correlations and volatilities are drawn primarily from the jp morgan riskmetricstm datasets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued based on our overall currency exposure including derivative positions during  the risk during to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average less than million  with a high of million and a low of million 
at december   currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next months by less than million  within a confidence level 
compared with our projection at december   the var amount is approximately million higher  primarily because of significantly increased currency exchange rate volatility and the inclusion of land rover currency exposures and hedges 
commodity price risk we enter into commodity forward and option contracts 
such contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals eg  aluminum used in the manufacturing of automotive components 
the fair value liability of such contracts  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of commodity forward and option contracts  assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price change in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
ford credit market and other risks in the normal course of business  ford credit is exposed to several types of risk 
these risks include primarily credit  residual  interest rate  currency and liquidity risks 
each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to ford credit s overall global risk 
business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks 
following is a discussion of ford credit s risk management practices used to manage more than of ford credit s worldwide net finance receivables and operating leases  which equaled billion and billion  respectively  at december   and essentially all liabilities and equity 
ford credit is continuously reviewing and improving its risk management practices and extending these risk management practices to its remaining portfolio around the world 
credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms 
ford credit actively manages credit risk of consumer and non consumer products to balance the level of risk and return 
consumer credit retail products vehicle installment sale and lease contracts are divided into more than segments by risk tier  term and whether the vehicle financed is new or used 
this segment data are used to assist with product pricing to ensure risk factors are appropriately considered 
data segmentation is also used in contract servicing to make certain that contracts receive attention appropriate to their risk level 
in addition  ford credit is reorganizing into regional service centers to streamline retail customer service activities and to realize economies of scale from the latest servicing technology 
credit investigations include a credit bureau review of each applicant together with an internal review and verification process 
retail credit loss management strategy is based on historical experience of more than million contracts 
statistically based retail credit risk rating models are used to determine the creditworthiness of applicants 
the accuracy of these models is reviewed and revalidated quarterly against actual performance and recalibrated  as necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued ford credit has developed behavioral models to assist in determining optimal collection strategies 
accounts are placed in risk categories for collection follow up 
reasonable efforts are made to collect on delinquent accounts and keep accounts current 
repossession is considered a last resort 
a repossessed vehicle is sold and proceeds are applied to the amount owing on the receivable 
ford s vehicle remarketing department manages the sale of repossessed vehicles  seeking the highest net price for the vehicle 
collection of the remaining balance continues after repossession until the account is paid in full or is deemed uncollectible by ford credit 
non consumer credit ford credit extends non consumer credit primarily to vehicle dealers in the form of approved lines of credit to purchase inventories of new and used vehicles 
in addition  ford credit provides mortgage  working capital and other types of loans to dealers 
ford credit also provides state and local governments  leasing and daily rental companies as well as other commercial entities with financing for their automotive needs 
each non consumer loan is evaluated  taking into consideration the borrower s financial condition  collateral  debt servicing capacity  and numerous other financial and qualitative factors 
all credit exposures are reviewed at least annually with special loan committees reviewing higher credit exposures 
to monitor potential credit deterioration  dealers are required to submit monthly financial statements 
an evaluation rating is assigned to each dealer and physical audits of vehicle inventory are performed periodically  with higher audit frequency for higher risk dealers 
in addition  inventory financing payoffs are monitored daily to detect adverse deviations from typical payoff patterns  in which case appropriate actions are taken 
residual risk residual risk is the possibility that the actual proceeds realized by ford credit upon the sale of returned vehicles at lease termination will be lower than the internal forecast of residual values 
in general  lease contracts are written with vehicle lease end values based on automotive leasing guide alg residual guidelines 
for financial reporting purposes  however  ford credit sets the internal value of expected residual values net of costs based on a proprietary econometric model that uses historical experience and forward looking information available to ford credit 
this information includes new product plans  marketing programs and quality metrics 
any unfavorable gap between ford credit s internal forecast and contract lease end value is reserved on the balance sheet as depreciation 
reserve adequacy is reviewed quarterly to reflect changes in the projected values 
at lease termination  ford credit maximizes residual proceeds through the use of models to determine which geographic market would yield the highest resale value  net of transportation cost 
lease extensions or early terminations also may be offered to take advantage of seasonal resale patterns 
financial market risk the goal of financial market risk management is to reduce the profit volatility effect of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate and currency exposures are monitored and managed by ford credit as an integral part of its overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on ford credit s operating results 
risk is reduced in two ways through the use of funding instruments that have interest and maturity profiles similar to the assets they are funding  and through the use of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives 
ford credit s derivatives strategy is defensive  derivatives are not used for speculative purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued interest rate risk ford credit s asset base consists primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts  with an average life of about two years  and floating rate inventory financing receivables 
funding sources consist of short term commercial paper  term debt and receivable sales 
to ensure funding availability over a business cycle  ford credit often borrows longer term debt five to ten years 
interest rate swaps are used to change the interest characteristics of the debt to match the interest rate characteristics of ford credit s assets 
this matching locks in margins and reduces profit volatility 
a portion of assets are funded with equity  and volatility can occur as changes in interest rates impact the market value of equity 
this volatility is usually small 
the interest rate sensitivity of ford credit s assets and liabilities  including hedges  is evaluated each month 
in addition  the hedging strategy is stress tested periodically to ensure it remains effective over a range of potential changes in interest rates 
assuming an instantaneous increase of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial assets  debt and hedging instruments  ford credit s after tax earnings would decline by million over the ensuing twelve month period 
currency risk ford credit generally manages assets and liabilities in local country currency  thus eliminating exposure to exchange rate movements 
when a different currency is used  ford credit typically uses foreign currency agreements to hedge specific debt instruments and intercompany loans 
ford credit s earnings in the ensuing twelve month period would not be materially affected by the change in the value of ford credit s financial assets  debt and hedging instruments resulting from an instantaneous change in foreign currency rates relative to the us dollar 
counterparty risk counterparty risk relates to the loss to ford credit that could occur if the counterparty to an interest rate or foreign currency hedging or similar contract with ford credit defaults 
ford and ford credit jointly establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification 
exposures to counterparties  including the mark to market on derivatives  are monitored on a perodic basis 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet all present and future financial obligations as they come due 
one of ford credit s major objectives is to maintain funding availability through any economic or business cycle 
ford credit focuses on developing funding sources to support both growth and refinancing maturing debt 
ford credit also issues debt that on average matures later than assets liquidate  further enhancing overall liquidity 
ford credit is one of the world s largest issuers of corporate debt 
global funding activities include the direct sale of commercial paper  the placement of term debt to retail and institutional investors and the sale of receivables 
management closely monitors the amount of short term funding and mix of short term funding to total debt  the overall composition of total debt and the availability of committed credit facilities in relation to the level of outstanding short term debt 
stress testing of ford credit s liquidity position is conducted periodically 
recent efforts to provide additional sources of liquidity and further diversify ford credit s funding base include the reduction in the reliance on short term debt and the development of more efficient term debt instruments 
in  ford credit implemented the first corporate global bond program globlstm  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued which offers large liquid transactions with broad investor participation  investor loyalty  and enhanced secondary market performance 
other major initiatives include a multi issuer euro medium term note program for certain international affiliates and the first corporate internet bond offering 
also  the sale of receivables through asset backed securitization abs program was expanded to appeal to a global investor base the first global abs transaction was issued by ford credit in the sale of asset backed commercial paper also adds to ford credit s funding capacity 
ford credit has  and has the ability to use ford s  committed lines of credit from major banks  which provide additional levels of liquidity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these credit lines 
about of these facilities have five year terms 
these facilities do not contain restrictive financial covenants eg  debt to equity limitations or material adverse change clauses that could preclude borrowing under these facilities 
ford credit capital adequacy underlying ford credit s risk and capital management strategies is the need to effectively leverage capital in a way that o protects creditors against worst case unexpected losses consistent with ford credit s debt ratings 
o provides adequate returns by pricing products commensurate with the level of risk 
ford credit s capital management framework optimizes the use of capital by sizing equity in proportion to risk 
ford credit manages its capital structure and makes adjustments as the level of portfolio risk changes 
a capital adequacy study that quantifies the sources of creditors risk protection and stress tests risks is performed semi annually 
sources of creditor risk protection in evaluating the sources of creditor risk protection  ford credit looks beyond equity stated in its financial statements  and analyzes cash flows in the event of worst case unexpected losses 
net revenue from the existing asset portfolio  credit loss reserves  residual loss reserves  and net deferred tax liabilities provide incremental creditor risk protection  in addition to stated equity on the balance sheet 
ford credit believes that the traditional view of capital adequacy  expressed as debt to equity ratios  excludes other sources of creditor risk protection  understating creditor risk protection 
ford credit s objective is to provide customers with competitively priced financing products 
in addition to taking into consideration borrowing and operating costs  ford credit s pricing model includes factors related to credit and residual risks  profits and related income taxes 
to date  total net revenue from the existing asset portfolio has been sufficient to cover both expected and unexpected losses 
for example  ford credit continued to be profitable even in periods when it experienced higher than normal credit losses late s and residual losses late s 
creditor risk protection associated with total net revenue is evaluated using a conservative estimate of lifetime expected net income and related income taxes from the existing portfolio  after consideration of defaults associated with stress testing 
additional sources of creditor risk protection  in the form of reserves on the balance sheet  include credit loss reserves and residual loss reserves 
credit and residual loss reserves are established to reflect partial impairment of underlying asset values as recorded on the balance sheet due to expected losses 
establishment of these reserves results in a charge to earnings equity before actual losses occur 
because these reserves are established in addition to credit and residual loss expectation factors included in pricing  they protect creditors if actual losses exceed initial loss expectations 
net deferred tax liabilities reflect timing differences between the financial statement and tax treatment of revenues and expenses 
in the event of unexpected losses  the net deferred tax liability is reduced or eliminated without any actual tax payment  thus providing an additional source of creditor risk protection 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued quantifying risk through stress testing as part of ford credit s capital adequacy study  the asset portfolio is stress tested semiannually to simulate lifetime worst case unexpected losses and define the level of capital required 
the results of this study are integrated into the pricing of ford credit s products by allocating a capital charge to all products consistent with the underlying risks of each product 
the stress test study is based on statistical modeling of lifetime worst case unexpected losses for each asset class 
worst case unexpected losses are calculated at a confidence level  consistent with bond default levels for single a rated companies 
all risk drivers in the portfolio are stress tested  including the likelihood that all segments of the portfolio will experience worst case losses at the same time 
following is a discussion of the methodology used to stress test consumer credit risk and residual losses o consumer credit loss stress testing is based on the historical experience of nearly fifteen million liquidated contracts purchased since the historic portfolio is stratified and the distribution and correlations of defaults for each group are analyzed 
finally  a simulation model is used to replicate potential retail portfolio behavior in worst case scenarios  assuming that distribution of defaults is statistically lognormal 
o residual loss stress testing is based on the historical experience of dispositions since and assumes that all of the vehicles from non defaulting leases will be returned to ford credit at the end of the lease term 
the historic portfolio is stratified and a statistical model is used to estimate the volatility of auction values 
finally  to compensate for limited historical data  years of used vehicle price volatility is incorporated 
capital adequacy study conclusions to assess ford credit s capital adequacy  stress testing results total lifetime worst case unexpected losses are compared against all sources of creditor risk protection 
at december   ford credit believed that its creditors had risk protection of more than of modeled worst case unexpected losses for any operational and other risks that may not have been quantified in the study 
ford credit updates the capital adequacy study semi annually 
capital will be adjusted as the level of risk and other sources of creditor risk protection changes
