item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were founded in to commercialize and enhance our proprietary vgf technique for producing high performance compound semiconductor substrates 
we currently operate two divisions our substrate division and our visible emitter division 
we made our first substrate sales in and our substrate division currently sells gaas and inp substrates to manufacturers of semiconductor devices for use in applications such as fiber optic and wireless telecommunications  leds and lasers 
we also sell germanium substrates for use in satellite solar cells 
we acquired lyte optronics  inc  on may   and currently operate part of lyte s historical business as our visible emitter division 
the visible emitter division manufactures hbleds  vcsels and laser diodes for the illumination markets  including full color displays  automobile lighting and traffic signals  as well as fiber optic communications 
we previously operated lyte s other historical business as the consumer products division which was discontinued in december this division had focused on the design and manufacture of laser pointing and alignment products for the consumer  commercial and industrial markets 
we have been profitable on an annual basis since our total revenue from continuing operations was million for  million for and million for our income from continuing operations was million for  million for and million for in the third quarter of  we raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a private offering and a registered public offering 
several non recurring events occurred that had a substantial impact on our performance and financial results for the quarter and year ended december  first  we realized a million non cash gain as a result of finisar corporation s acquisition of demeter technologies  a company in which we held warrants to purchase preferred stock 
this gain is included in other income 
second  on december   the board of directors approved our plan to discontinue our unprofitable consumer products division 
as a result of discontinuing the consumer products division  we incurred a pre tax loss on disposal of million 
the results of operations of the consumer products division have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported separately as discontinued operations in the income statements 
third  we are exiting our unprofitable nm laser diode product line at the visible emitter division 
as a result of exiting this product line  we incurred a restructuring charge of million  of which million has been classified as cost of goods sold and million has been classified as operating expense 
our five largest customers accounted for of our total revenue from continuing operations in  in and in no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in  or we expect to expand substantially our production capacity for compound substrates as well as blue  green and cyan hbleds 
most of the expansion for substrates will occur at our facilities in china and the remainder of our substrate expansion and all of our visible emitter expansion will occur at our california facilities 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for this expansion during the next months will be approximately million 
in connection with our acquisition of lyte optronics and its subsidiaries  we issued approximately  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  with a annual dividend rate and per share liquidation preference over common stock  as adjusted for claims made against shares held in escrow  in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of lyte optronics 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in connection with the acquisition  we reported a charge of million in the second quarter of to reflect transaction costs and other one time charges 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to our customers provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience at the time revenue is recognized 
except for sales in japan and some sales in taiwan  which in both cases are denominated in japanese yen  we denominate and collect our international sales in us dollars 
each of our divisions is responsible for its own sales and marketing activities  and each maintains its own sales and marketing personnel 
we sell our substrate products through our direct sales force in the us and through independent sales representatives in france  japan  south korea  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we sell our hbled and vcsel products through our direct sales force and through independent sales representatives

revenue from our visible emitter division which represents of total revenue for  decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease was a result of lower laser diode sales volume and a decrease in prices 
international revenue decreased to of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in gross margin 
gross margin increased to of revenue in compared to in the gross margin at the substrate division increased to of revenue in compared to in the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and the realization of lower labor and manufacturing costs as a result of expanding our wafer production capacity in china 
the gross margin at the visible emitter division decreased to negative of revenue for compared to for the decrease was primarily due to increased costs associated with the start up of blue hbled and vcsel product production  lower laser diode sales prices and volume and a restructuring charge to write off obsolete laser diode inventory as part of our plan to exit the unprofitable nm laser diode product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel and related expenses required to support current and future increases in sales volume 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of increases in personnel and related expenses and materials to support hbled and vcsel research and development at the visible emitter division 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were in compared to in restructuring costs 
on december   the company s board of directors approved management s plan to exit its unprofitable nm laser diode product line within its visible emitter division 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring charge includes million to write off laser diode inventory  which has been classified as a component of cost of goods sold 
the restructuring charge also includes million to write off net assets included in property  plant and equipment 
these assets consist of laser diode processing equipment that could not be utilized for hbled or vcsel processing 
these assets have been taken out of service and will be sold or discarded 
the restructuring charge also includes  to write down a portion of goodwill attributable to the laser diode product line 
the restructuring charge also includes million for incremental costs and contractual obligations for such items as leasehold termination payments and other facility exit costs incurred as a direct result of this plan 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to using short term debt to finance the short term liquidity needs resulting from our increased sales volume as well as the addition of certain capital leases to finance equipment purchases 
other income and expense 
other income and expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of a million non cash gain on demeter technology warrants that were exchanged for finisar corporation common stock as a result of finisar corporation s acquisition of demeter technology

acquisition cost 
as a result of the acquisition of lyte optronics in may  we incurred a number of one time expenses which totaled approximately million 
these expenses included fees paid to our investment bankers  accountants  attorneys and other outside consultants and related transaction expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or million to million in compared to  in this increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of the visible emitter division for a full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in  which resulted in increased borrowing on a line of credit 
other income and expense

net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items of million  and by million used in working capital and other activities 
net cash used in working capital and other activities resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable and inventory  offset by increases in accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes and prepaid expenses 
net cash used in investing activities of million primarily reflects purchases of property and equipment to increase crystal growth and wafer processing capacity at the substrate division and to increase hbled and vcsel epitaxy growth and wafer processing capacity at the visible emitter division 
we also invested million in a joint venture in china to provide certain materials 
we are currently constructing an additional  square foot building in beijing  china to expand substrate wafer processing capacity and a  square foot building in el monte  california to expand hbled and vcsel production 
we are also constructing improvements to our existing production facilities in fremont  california to increase crystal growth and wafer processing capacity 
we expect to invest approximately million in additional facilities and equipment over the next months 
net cash provided by financing activities of million consisted of proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and million from new real estate loans  offset by payments of million to reduce our short term borrowings  million to retire old real estate loans and principal and interest payments on long term debt and million for capital lease payments 
we currently have a million line of credit with a commercial bank bearing interest at above libor that was at december  this line of credit is secured by all of our assets  other than equipment  and expires on may  at december   there was no balance outstanding under the line of credit 
we generally finance equipment purchases through secured equipment loans and capital leases over five year terms at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
some of our manufacturing facilities have been financed by long term borrowings  which were refinanced by taxable variable rate revenue bonds in these bonds mature in and bear interest at below the prime rate 
the bonds are traded in the public market 
repayment of principal and interest under the bonds is supported by a letter of credit from our bank and is paid on a quarterly basis 
we have the option to redeem the bonds in whole or in part during their term 
at december   million was outstanding under these bonds 
we anticipate that the combination of existing working capital and the borrowings available under our current credit agreements will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
however  our future capital requirements will be dependent on many factors including the rate of revenue growth  our profitability  the timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs  the expansion of our manufacturing facilities  the expansion of our selling and marketing and administrative activities and market acceptance of our products 
we may need to obtain additional equity and debt financing in the future  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
in june  sfas was amended by sfas we will implement sfas beginning in we do not expect that adopting the provisions of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we have adopted the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition  which did not and does not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
risks related to our business unpredictable fluctuations in our operating results could disappoint analysts or our investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rate  and we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue and earnings in the future 
our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including fluctuations in demand for our products  expansion of our manufacturing capacity  expansion of our operations in china  limited availability and increased cost of raw materials  integration of lyte optronics and its business  operations and facilities with our operations  the volume and timing of orders from our customers  fluctuation of our manufacturing yields  decreases in the prices of our competitors products  costs incurred in connection with any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies  increases in our expenses  including expenses for research and development  and our ability to develop  manufacture and deliver high quality products in a timely and cost effective manner 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful indicator of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
if we fail to expand our manufacturing capacity  we may not be able to meet demand for our products  lower our costs or increase revenue 
in order to increase production  we must build new facilities  expand our existing facilities and purchase additional manufacturing equipment 
if we do not expand our manufacturing capacity  we will be unable to increase production  adversely impacting our ability to reduce unit costs  margins and improve our operating results 
we are currently constructing additional capacity and facilities in california and china 
our expansion activities subject us to a number of risks  including unforeseen environmental or engineering problems  unavailability or late delivery of production equipment  delays in completing new facilities  delays in bringing production equipment on line  work stoppages or delays  unanticipated cost increases  and restrictions imposed by requirements of local  state or federal regulatory agencies 
if any of these risks occurs  construction may be costlier than anticipated and completion could be delayed  which could hurt our ability to expand capacity and increase our sales 
in addition  if we experience delays in expanding our manufacturing capacity  we might not be able to timely meet customer requirements  and we could lose future sales 
we are also making substantial investments in equipment and facilities as part of our capacity expansion 
to offset the additional fixed operating expenses  we must increase our revenue by increasing production and improving yields 
if demand for our products does not grow or if our yields do not improve as anticipated  we may be unable to offset these costs against increased revenue  which would adversely impact our operating results 
we have limited experience with some of our new products  and we may not be able to achieve anticipated sales of these products 
to date  we have limited experience producing and selling our hbled and vcsel products  and we may be unable to successfully market and sell these products 
to market and sell our hbled and vcsel products  we will have to develop additional distribution channels 
in addition  we must apply our proprietary vgf technique to new substrate products and successfully introduce and market new opto electronic semiconductor devices  including led and vcsel products 
if we do not successfully develop new products to respond to rapidly changing customer requirements  our ability to generate sales and obtain new customers may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to offer new products that incorporate leading technology and respond to technological advances 
in addition  our new products must meet customer needs and compete effectively on quality  price and performance 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
if our competitors introduce products employing new technologies  our existing products could become obsolete and unmarketable 
if we fail to offer new products  we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our development costs and other expenses or meet our customers requirements 
other companies  including ibm  are actively developing substrate materials that could be used to manufacture devices that could provide the same high performance  low power capabilities as gaas based devices at competitive prices 
if these substrate materials are successfully developed and semiconductor device manufacturers adopt them  demand for our gaas substrates could decline and our revenue could suffer 
the development of new products can be a highly complex process  and we may experience delays in developing and introducing new products 
any significant delays could cause us to fail to timely introduce and gain market acceptance of new products 
further  the costs involved in researching  developing and engineering new products could be greater than anticipated 
our operating results depend in large part on further customer acceptance of our existing substrate products and on our ability to develop new products based on our core vgf technology 
a majority of gaas substrates are manufactured from crystals grown using the traditional liquid encapsulated czochralski  or lec  or horizontal bridgeman  or hb  techniques 
in order to expand sales of our products  we must continue to promote our vgf technique as a preferred process for producing substrates  and we must offer products with superior prices and performance on a timely basis and in sufficient volumes 
if we fail to gain increased market acceptance of our vgf technique  we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth 
intense competition in the markets for our products could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive 
we face competition for our substrate products from other manufacturers of substrates  such as freiberger  hitachi cable  japan energy  litton airtron and sumitomo electric and from semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own use  and from companies  such as ibm  that are actively developing alternative materials to gaas 
we believe that at least one of our competitors has recently begun shipping gaas substrates manufactured using a technique similar to our vgf technique 
other competitors may develop and begin using similar technology 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue may not increase and we may not continue to be profitable 
we face many competitors that have a number of significant advantages over us  particularly in our compound semiconductor device products  including greater experience in the business  more manufacturing experience  broader name recognition  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our competitors could develop new or enhanced products that are more effective than the products that we have developed or may develop 
for example  some competitors in the hbled market offer devices that are brighter than our hbleds 
some of our competitors may also develop technologies that enable the production of commercial products with characteristics similar to or better than ours  but at a lower cost 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share  require us to reduce the prices of our products  affect our ability to recover costs or result in reduced gross margins 
if we have low product yields  the shipment of our products may be delayed and our operating results may be adversely impacted 
our products are manufactured using complex technologies  and the number of usable substrates and devices we can produce can fluctuate as a result of many factors  including impurities in the materials used  contamination of the manufacturing environment  substrate breakage  equipment failure  power outages or variations in the manufacturing process  and performance of personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
because many of our manufacturing costs are fixed  our revenue could decline if our yields decrease 
we have experienced product shipment delays and difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on both new and older products  and delays and poor yields have adversely affected our operating results 
we may experience similar problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
in addition  many of our manufacturing processes are new and are still being refined  which can result in lower yields  particularly as we focus on producing higher diameter substrates and new opto electronic semiconductor devices 
for example  we recently began manufacturing six inch gaas wafers and have also made substantial investments in equipment and facilities to manufacture blue  green and cyan hbleds 
if we are unable to produce adequate quantities of our high brightness leds and vcsels  we may not be able to meet customer demand and our revenue may decrease 
demand for our products may decrease if our customers experience difficulty manufacturing  marketing or selling their products 
our products are used as components in our customers products 
accordingly  demand for our products is subject to factors affecting the ability of our customers to successfully introduce and market their products  including the competition our customers face in their particular industries  the technical  manufacturing  sales and marketing and management capabilities of our customers  the financial and other resources of our customers  and the inability of our customers to sell their products if they infringe third party intellectual property rights 
if demand for the products offered by our customers decreases  our customers may reduce purchases of our products 
we purchase critical raw materials from single or limited sources  and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components and equipment used in manufacturing our products  including key materials such as gallium  arsenic and quartz 
we generally purchase these materials through standard purchase orders and not pursuant to long term supply contracts and none of our suppliers guarantees supply of raw materials to us 
if we lose any of our key suppliers  our manufacturing efforts could be significantly hampered and we could be prevented from timely producing and delivering products to our customers 
we have experienced delays obtaining critical raw materials  including gallium  due to shortages of these materials 
we may experience delays due to shortages of materials and may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of materials 
these shortages and delays could result in higher materials costs and cause us to delay or reduce production of our products 
if we have to delay or reduce production  we could fail to meet customer delivery schedules  and our revenue and operating results could suffer 
if we fail to comply with environmental regulations  we may be subject to significant fines or cessation of our operations 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  rules and regulations govern the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing  research and development and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
we are cooperating with the california occupational safety and health administration  or cal osha  in an investigation primarily regarding impermissible levels of potentially hazardous materials in certain areas of our manufacturing facility in fremont  california 
in may  cal osha levied a fine against us in the amount of  for alleged health and safety violations 
we are appealing the citations  and have put in place engineering  administrative and personnel protective equipment programs to address these issues  but we may have to pay this fine 
our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be restricted or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
in addition  existing or future changes in laws or regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures or liabilities  or may restrict our operations 
the loss of one or more of our key substrate customers would significantly hurt our operating results 
a small number of substrate customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our total revenue 
our five largest customers accounted for of our total revenue from continuing operations in  in and in no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in  and our substrate revenue accounted for of our total revenue from continuing operations in  in and in we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of substrate customers 
our customers are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of our products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases 
in addition  our customers may reduce  delay or cancel orders at any time without any significant penalty 
if we lose a major customer or if a customer cancels  reduces or delays orders  our revenue would decline 
in addition  customers that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not continue to generate revenue for us in any future period 
defects in our products could diminish demand for our products 
our products are complex and may contain defects 
in the past we have experienced quality control problems with some of our led and consumer products  which caused customers to return products to us 
if we continue to experience quality control problems  or experience these problems in our other products  customers may cancel or reduce orders or purchase products from our competitors 
defects in our products could cause us to incur higher manufacturing costs and suffer product returns and additional service expenses  all of which could adversely impact our operating results 
we are also developing new products and product enhancements  including substrates and compound semiconductor device products 
if our new products contain defects when released  our customers may be dissatisfied and we may suffer negative publicity or customer claims against us  lose sales or experience delays in market acceptance of our new products 
cyclicality in the semiconductor industry could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of semiconductor devices  as well as the current and anticipated market demand for such devices and the products using such devices 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has in the past  and will likely in the future  experience periods of oversupply that result in significantly reduced demand for semiconductor devices and components  including our products 
when these periods occur  our operating results and financial condition are adversely affected 
our substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products have a long sales cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results 
customers typically place orders with us for our substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products three months to a year or more after our initial contact with them 
the sale of our products may be subject to delays due to our customers lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
during this time  we may incur substantial expenses and expend sales  marketing and management efforts while the customers evaluate our products 
these expenditures may not result in sales of our products 
if we do not achieve anticipated sales in a period as expected  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in our revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to cover expenses  causing our operating results to vary 
in addition  if a customer decides not to incorporate our products into its initial design  we may not have another opportunity to sell products to this customer for many months or even years 
we anticipate that sales of any future substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products under development will also have lengthy sales cycles and will  therefore  be subject to risks substantially similar to those inherent in the lengthy sales cycle of our current substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products 
if we fail to manage our potential growth  our operations may be disrupted 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion that has strained our management and other resources  and we expect this rapid growth to continue 
our acquisition of lyte optronics  together with expansion of our manufacturing capacity  has placed and continues to place a significant strain on our operations and management resources 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our operations may be disrupted 
to manage our growth effectively  we must implement additional and improved management information systems  further develop our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls  add experienced senior level managers  and maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  accounting  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
we will spend substantial sums to support our growth and may incur additional unexpected costs 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations  and we may be unable to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on expanding sales and marketing  research and development and administrative support 
if we cannot attract qualified people or manage growth effectively  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
any future acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or distract management attention 
as part of our strategy  we may consider acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer products  services and technologies complementary to ours  such as our acquisition of lyte optronics in may acquisitions entail numerous risks  including we may have difficulty assimilating the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses  our ongoing business may be disrupted  we may incur unanticipated costs  our management may be unable to manage the financial and strategic position of acquired or developed products  services and technologies  we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls and procedures and policies  and our relationships with employees and customers may be impaired as a result of any integration 
for example  we incurred substantial costs in connection with our acquisition of lyte optronics  including the assumption of approximately million of debt  much of which has been repaid or renegotiated  resulting in a decline of cash available 
we incurred one time charges and merger related expenses of million and an extraordinary item of  relating to the early extinguishment of debt in the quarter ended june  as a result of the acquisition 
to the extent that we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisitions  dilution to our existing stockholders will result and our earnings per share may suffer 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
if any of our facilities is damaged  we may not be able to manufacture our products 
the ongoing operation of our manufacturing and production facilities in california and china is critical to our ability to meet demand for our products 
if we are not able to use all or a significant portion of our facilities for prolonged periods for any reason  we will not be able to manufacture products for our customers 
for example  a natural disaster  fire or explosion caused by our use of combustible chemicals and high temperatures during our manufacturing processes would render some or all of our facilities inoperable for an indefinite period of time 
actions outside of our control  such as earthquakes  could also damage our facilities  rendering them inoperable 
all of our crystal growth is currently performed at our fremont  california facilities  which are located very near to an active seismic fault line 
if we are unable to operate our facilities and manufacture our products  we will lose customers and revenue and our business will be harmed 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our success depends upon the continued service of morris s 
young  phd  our president  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  as well as other key management and technical personnel 
we do not have long term employment contracts with  or key person life insurance on  any of our key personnel 
in addition  we have only recently hired our chief financial officer  and need to retain senior marketing personnel  particularly for our new opto electronic semiconductor device products 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
the competition for these employees is intense  especially in silicon valley  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  including the timely introduction of new products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets or incur costly litigation 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
however  we believe that  due to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the markets for our products  our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership also depends on the skills of our development personnel 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  a third party could develop products or processes similar to ours 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
we believe that at least one of our competitors has begun to ship gaas substrates produced using a process similar to our vgf technique 
our competitors may also develop and patent improvements to the vgf  led and vcsel technologies upon which we rely  and thus may limit any exclusivity we enjoy by virtue of our patents 
it is possible that pending or future united states or foreign patent applications made by us will not be approved  that our issued patents will not protect our intellectual property  or that third parties will challenge the ownership rights or the validity of our patents 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our intellectual property 
our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain non patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems 
if this occurs  we may not be able to prevent the development of technology substantially similar to ours 
we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending our proprietary technology is expensive  could cause us to divert resources and may not prove successful 
our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  and if we fail to enforce or protect our rights  we could lose valuable assets 
we might face intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
the markets in which we compete are comprised of competitors who in some cases hold substantial patent portfolios covering aspects of products that could be similar to ours 
we could become subject to claims that we are infringing patent  trademark  copyright or other proprietary rights of others 
litigation to determine the validity of alleged claims could be time consuming and result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is ultimately determined in our favor 
if a lawsuit is decided against us  we could be subject to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek costly licenses or preventing us from manufacturing and selling our products 
we may not be able to obtain required licensing agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales  and our ability to sustain and increase our international sales involves significant risks 
our revenue growth depends in part on the expansion of our international sales and operations 
international sales represented of our total revenue from continuing operations for  for and for we expect that sales to customers outside the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
our dependence on international sales involves a number of risks  including changes in tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer periods to collect accounts receivable  changes in export license requirements  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our sales are denominated in us dollars  except for sales to our japanese and some taiwanese customers  which are denominated in japanese yen 
thus  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products in these markets 
also  denominating some sales in japanese yen subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
the functional currencies of our japanese and chinese subsidiaries are the local currencies 
we incur transaction gains or losses resulting from consolidation of expenses incurred in local currencies for these subsidiaries  as well as in translation of the assets and liabilities of these assets at each balance sheet date 
if we do not effectively manage the risks associated with international sales  our revenue and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if our expansion in china is more costly than we expect  our operating results will suffer 
as part of our planned expansion of our manufacturing capacity  we are building new facilities and expanding existing facilities in china 
if we are unable to build and expand our chinese facilities in a timely manner  we may not be able to increase production of our products and increase revenue as planned 
if our expansion in china proves more costly than we anticipate or we incur greater ongoing costs than we expect  our operating results would be adversely affected 
if we do not realize expected cost savings once our expansion is complete in china  our margins may be negatively impacted and our operating results may suffer 
changes in china s political  social and economic environment may affect our financial performance 
our financial performance may be affected by changes in china s political  social and economic environment 
the role of the chinese central and local governments in the chinese economy is significant 
chinese policies toward economic liberalization  and laws and policies affecting technology companies  foreign investment  currency exchange rates and other matters could change  resulting in greater restrictions on our ability to do business and operate our manufacturing facilities in china 
any imposition of surcharges or any increase in chinese tax rates could hurt our operating results 
the chinese government could revoke  terminate or suspend our license for national security and similar reasons without compensation to us 
if the government of china were to take any of these actions  we would be prevented from conducting all or part of our business 
any failure on our part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the loss of our ability to manufacture our products in china 
china has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities 
confrontations have occurred between the military and civilians 
events of this nature could influence the chinese economy  result in nationalization of foreign owned operations such as ours  and could negatively affect our ability to operate our facilities in china 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly since we began trading on the nasdaq national market 
for the months ended december   the high and low closing sales prices of our common stock were and 
a number of factors could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results  changes in expectations about our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  new product introduction by us or our competitors  large customer orders or order cancellations  and the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we may need additional capital to fund expansion of our manufacturing capacity and our future operations  which may not be available 
we may need additional capital to fund expansion of our manufacturing and production capacity and our future operations or acquisitions 
if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of holders of our common stock 
for example  in december we issued debt securities for the purchase and improvement of our facilities in fremont  california 
if we require additional capital in the future  it might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned expansion of our manufacturing capacity or of our product development and marketing efforts  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
provisions in our charter  bylaws or delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger  acquisition or change of control of us  or changes in our management 
these provisions include the division of our board of directors into three separate classes  each with three year terms  the right of our board to elect a director to fill a space created by a board vacancy or the expansion of the board  the ability of our board to alter our bylaws  the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  and the requirement that only our board or the holders of at least of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of our stockholders 
furthermore  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination with a corporation unless of the shares of voting stock not owned by these large stockholders approve the merger or combination  or the board of directors approves the merger or combination or the transaction which resulted in the large stockholder owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk since our japanese and some taiwanese invoices are denominated in japanese yen  doing business in japan subjects us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
we incurred a foreign transaction exchange loss of  in  a gain of  in  and a loss of  in we purchase foreign exchange contracts to hedge against certain trade accounts receivable in japanese yen 
the outstanding commitments with respect to such foreign exchange contracts had a total contract value of approximately  as of december  many of the contracts were entered into six months prior to the due date and the dates coincide with the receivable terms on customer invoices 
by matching the receivable collection date and contract due date  we attempt to economically minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
the fair market value of long term fixed and variable interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows 
marketable securities are valued at fair market value at december  there is no assurance that we will realize this value when we sell these securities in the future
