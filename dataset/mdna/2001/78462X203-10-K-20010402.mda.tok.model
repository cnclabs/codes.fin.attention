under the amendment  such prepayments are to be applied to reduce the principal amount of the last required payments under the note purchase agreement 
the company intends to renew its credit facility before its expiration on july   and is currently negotiating with certain banks for the most favorable terms 
the company believes that it may not be able to renew such facility  which is currently unsecured  either through its existing lenders or new lenders unless it grants to such lenders a security interest in at least a majority of its assets  including accounts receivable 
however  under the note purchase agreement  the company shall not incur  assume or suffer to exist any lien upon any of its assets currently or hereafter owned  or upon the income or profits thereof  other than  among other permitted liens  liens securing indebtedness of the company so long as all priority debt does not exceed of consolidated net worth all terms capitalized in this sentence but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the note purchase agreement 
in order to grant a security interest as is likely to be required by the lenders under the credit facility  the company must obtain the consent of the holders of the senior unsecured notes to a waiver of such covenant of the note purchase agreement 
in the event that the holders of the senior unsecured notes require that the company also grant a security interest to such holders as a condition to such consent  the company believes that it would have insufficient assets to secure both debt obligations 
management believes that the present credit facility and the credit facility it is currently negotiating  together with cash reserves and cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if the company were to expand its operations significantly experience a significant downturn in its business or fail to negotiate a new credit facility  additional capital may be required 
although management is confident that the credit facility will be renewed  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional capital at acceptable rates

historically  the commercial staffing segment has experienced lower revenues in the first quarter with revenues accelerating during the second and third quarters and then starting to slow during the fourth quarter 
the it segment does not experience the same level of seasonality associated with the commercial staffing segment 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily in relation to its revolving credit facility and its senior unsecured notes 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to manage its market risk within its revolving credit facility  the company is able to borrow against the facility at either i the bank s prime rate  or ii libor plus an applicable margin for a fixed period of time 
the company s senior debt placement bears interest at a fixed interest rate 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of the debt  but not the earnings or cash flows of the company 
changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt generally will not have a significant impact on the company unless the company is required to refinance such debt

the estimated fair value of the obligation on the unsecured notes  using a discount rate of over the expected maturities of the obligations  is approximately million 
if the discount rate were to increase by to  the estimated fair value of the obligation on the unsecured notes would be approximately million 
if the discount rate were to decrease by to  the estimated fair value of the obligation on the unsecured notes would be approximately million
