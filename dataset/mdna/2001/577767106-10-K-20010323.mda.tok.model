item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we apply industry leading capabilities in power and computing to develop and commercialize electronic components and power and computing systems for oem customers in multiple industries  including transportation  telecommunications  consumer and industrial electronics  medical and aerospace 
in december  we adopted a plan to restructure our operations 
this restructuring plan consolidated certain commercial business operations and improved their manufacturing and other operational capabilities  focused our defense contracting business on pulsed power systems and computer based analysis for government and national laboratories  focused the application of purebright broad spectrum pulsed light technology on bioprocessing  medical and consumer water markets  and provided for the sale of certain non strategic business operations 
the goal of the restructuring plan was to create a product driven  high growth company and to improve operating results by the fourth quarter of calendar year since january  we have recruited more than key managers with extensive commercial experience in engineering  manufacturing  material procurement  supply chain management  information technology  financial controls and sales and marketing 
we have also invested over million to build and outfit state of the art production facilities  including information technology infrastructure  and implement new manufacturing and business processes and systems to increase our production capacity and improve efficiency and product quality 
we experienced significant change in the early part of as part of our efforts to achieve the objectives of the restructuring plan on schedule 
we made significant progress and essentially completed our facilities and organizational consolidation program in october as part of the restructuring plan  we combined our high reliability electronic components businesses  including our powercache ultracapacitors  emi filtered feedthroughs and other ceramic capacitor products  and radiation shielded microelectronics  into a single commercial  high reliability electronic components group 
we also combined our applied computing systems business and our power quality systems business 
we focused our defense contracting business on pulsed power systems and computer based analysis for government and national laboratories and expect to sell this part of our business by the end of march we focused purepulse on significant opportunities in the application of our purebright technology to pathogen inactivation in medical and bioprocessing markets and to consumer water applications 
we are now exploring strategic alternatives for purepulse  which we expect will result in the sale of all or a majority interest in the business in finally  in calendar year  we sold our businesses involving high voltage wound film capacitors  high voltage power supplies and time card and job cost accounting software 
all financial information contained in this form k has been restated for all periods presented to reflect our defense contracting and purepulse businesses  as well as the businesses divested in  as discontinued operations 
our electronic components group and i bus phoenix power and computing systems business generate all of our revenues from continuing operations 
we are currently investing in our purepulse operations to develop broad spectrum pulsed light pathogen inactivation systems 
this investment will continue until such time as we complete a strategic transaction for the business 
we generate substantially all of our revenue from continuing operations from the sale of commercial products 
from time to time  we also generate revenue from licensing technology and other rights to strategic partners 
sales and marketing for our products in the united states  europe and asia are conducted through both direct and indirect sales channels 
we conduct marketing programs intended to position and promote our products  including trade shows  seminars  advertising  public relations  distribution of product literature and websites on the internet 
our ability to maintain and grow our sales depends on a variety of factors including our ability to maintain our competitive position in areas such as technology  performance  price  brand identity  quality  reliability  distribution  customer service and support 
our sales growth also depends on our ability to continue to introduce new products that respond to technological change  competitive pricing pressure and market demand in a timely manner 
our operating expenses are impacted by research and product development and selling  general and administrative activities 
selling expenses are primarily driven by sales volume  with respect to sales force expenses and commission expenses  the extent of market research activities for new product design efforts  advertising and trade show activities  and the number of new products launched in the period 
general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with our administrative employees  facilities and functions 
we incur expenses in foreign countries primarily in the functional currencies of such locations 
as a result of our international operations  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the united states dollar amount of our revenue and expenses 
in  we changed our fiscal year to a calendar year effective january  we previously reported results on a fiscal year of august through july business segments our continuing operations are comprised of the following two business segments 
electronic components group as part of the restructuring plan  we organized the electronic components group by combining numerous business units and product lines including our powercache ultracapacitors  emi filtered feedthroughs  ceramic capacitors and our radiation shielded microelectronics 
in october  we integrated the powercache ultracapacitor operations and the radiation shielded microelectronics operations into one new manufacturing site in san diego 
our emi filters and ceramic capacitors are manufactured at our facility in carson city  nevada  which was redesigned in both facilities were designed for highly efficient manufacturing  with improved processes  improved personnel training and more disciplined cost control practices 
the electronic components group consists primarily of the following power delivery and other high reliability devices product lines ultracapacitors for electrical energy storage and delivery of peak power for a variety of applications  emi filtered feedthroughs for cardiac pacemakers  defibrillators and other implantable medical devices and high temperature ceramic capacitors and filters used in oil exploration  and radiation shielded microelectronics  including integrated circuits  power modules and single board computers for space and military markets 
i bus phoenix power and computing systems as part of our restructuring plan  we integrated our i bus  inc and phoenix power systems  inc subsidiaries 
the i bus phoenix organization has operations in the us  europe and asia 
the new i bus phoenix operation is focused on providing high availability custom computing systems and power quality products 
as part of the restructuring plan  we combined the san diego operations of these two businesses into a single facility in october the new facility has been designed for highly efficient manufacturing  with improved processes  improved personnel training and more disciplined cost control practices 
our current i bus phoenix product offerings include applied computing systems  power distribution systems and power conditioning units 
we sell our products mainly to oems serving the telecommunications and internet infrastructure  industrial automation  broadcasting and medical imaging markets 
we have classified the following business segment as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 
purepulse purepulse designs and develops systems that generate extremely intense  broad spectrum  pulsed light to inactivate viruses and other pathogens that contaminate products sourced from human or animal tissues  such as plasma derivatives  transfusion blood components and biopharmaceuticals  and in the production of vaccines 
purepulse also is developing systems to purify water 
we are exploring strategic alternatives for purepulse  which we expect will result in the sale of all or a majority interest in the business in results of operations comparison and discussion of results of operations for the three months ended december  and the three months ended september  the following table sets forth our selected data  expressed as a percentage of sales  for the three months ended december   compared to the three months ended september  the three months ended december  was the first quarter of operations in our new facilities following the completion of the restructuring plan

a discussion of these improved quarterly results from continuing operations follows 
sales sales for the fourth quarter were million  reflecting a million  or  increase from sales of million for the third quarter 
sales in the fourth quarter in the i bus phoenix power and computing systems segment increased by million  or  from sales in the third quarter  driven primarily by increased sales of power quality products made possible by the increased manufacturing capacity available in the new facility 
we expect sales in this segment to continue to increase in  reflecting the contribution of sales of products acquired in connection with the acquisition of gateworks corporation  as well as the contribution of sales from new applied computing products  the first of which were introduced in the first quarter of we expect to introduce additional applied computing products in sales in the fourth quarter in the electronic components group segment increased by million  or  from sales in the third quarter  representing increased sales in all product lines of the electronic components group segment 
the increase in sales was largely attributable to increased production capacity in these business areas in their new or redesigned facilities 
sales of powercache ultracapacitors also increased due to shipments made during the fourth quarter in connection with our supply agreement with the allison transmission division of general motors corporation 
gross profit in the fourth quarter  our gross profit was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the third quarter 
the improvement in gross profit is attributable partly to increased sales volume in the fourth quarter and partly to the fact that million of valuation adjustments to inventories and other costs of goods sold variances in the power quality product lines of i bus phoenix were recorded to cost of sales in the third quarter  which did not recur in the fourth quarter 
in addition  we wrote off certain inventories in the third quarter related to decisions made to discontinue certain product lines 
we also had a higher margin mix of product sales in the fourth quarter in the microelectronics product lines of our electronic components group segment 
we began to realize the gross margin benefits of reduced overhead expenses in the fourth quarter of when we began to occupy our new and redesigned manufacturing facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million from million in the third quarter 
as a percentage of total sales these expenses decreased to in the fourth quarter  from in the third quarter  primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
these expenses in the fourth quarter reflect certain year end adjustments to accrued expenses  which reduced total selling  general and administrative expenses 
while we are continuing to focus on opportunities to decrease our selling  general and administrative expenses  we expect the level of such expenses in future quarters to more closely approximate the amount of such expenses in the third quarter 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses reflect internally funded research and development programs 
research and development expenses were million  or of sales  for the fourth quarter  as compared to million  or of sales  for the third quarter 
we have increased the level of spending in research and development to accelerate new product introductions and we expect our level of spending to remain at increased levels  as a percentage of sales  in future periods 
restructuring  acquisition and other charges in connection with our restructuring plan  we undertook various actions to improve our cost structure 
as a result  we recorded restructuring and other related charges of million during the third quarter 
these charges included severance costs related to reductions in headcount  costs associated with the closure and combination of certain facilities and the write off of non performing operating assets 
in the third quarter  we also recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill related to our acquisition of phoenix power systems  inc to an amount representative of the current appraised value of that asset 
also  in the third quarter  we recorded a charge of million related to in process technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of gateworks corporation in september we have completed the facilities and organizational consolidation program started as part of our restructuring plan  and therefore  we did not record any additional charges related to the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter and we do not expect to incur any such additional charges in the future 
operating loss as a result of the factors mentioned above  the operating loss was million for the fourth quarter as compared to an operating loss of million for the third quarter 
excluding restructuring  acquisition and other charges  operating loss was million for the fourth quarter as compared to million for the third quarter 
comparison and discussion of results of operations for the years ended december  and  the five months ended december   and the fiscal years ended july  and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our selected operating data  expressed as a percentage of sales

the major supply agreement contributed sales of million in the year ended december   compared to sales of million in sales in the year ended december  included contributions from licensing and strategic transactions of million  which contributed no sales revenue in the current year 
excluding sales from the major supply agreement and from licensing and strategic transactions  sales in the year ended december  were million  a million  or  increase over sales of million for the year ended december  in the five months ended december   sales totaled million 
in the fiscal year ended july   total sales were million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal year sales in the five months ended december  were negatively impacted by reduced revenues from licensing and strategic transactions and by economic issues facing certain customers in the commercial satellite and oil markets 
sales in the fiscal year ended july  increased over the fiscal year ended july  in each of our business segments 
sales to customers outside of the united states totaled million and million in the calendar years ended december  and  respectively  and million  million and million in the five months ended december  and in the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
expansion of our applied computing business in germany and france and the contribution of sales from our united kingdom applied computing operation  which was acquired in fiscal year  are the primary drivers for the increased foreign sales beginning in the fiscal year ended july  sales within each of our continuing business segments is as follows electronic components group 
for the year ended december   sales in the electronic components group segment increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  sales increased in all product lines of the electronic components group segment during  including a million increase in sales in our microelectronics product lines to customers in the commercial satellite market 
sales in our powercache ultracapacitor product lines also increased in  despite a million decrease in revenue received from technology license agreements  due primarily to shipments made during the fourth quarter in connection with our supply agreement with the allison transmission division of general motors corporation 
in the five months ended december   electronic components group sales totaled million  representing lower average monthly sales volumes than those achieved in the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in sales in the five months ended december  is partly attributable to the fact that no revenue was received in the five months ended december  from technology licenses and other collaborative agreements  while million of such revenue was received in the fiscal year ended july  in the powercache ultracapacitor product lines 
in addition  revenues from customers of our microelectronic components product lines in the commercial satellite market decreased in the five months ended december  due to economic issues affecting such customers 
also  over stock issues at our primary filtered feedthrough customer and weakness in oil and space markets resulted in decreased sales of our filtered feedthroughs and ceramic capacitors late in in the fiscal year ended july   electronic components group sales increased million  to million from million in the fiscal year ended july  sales of our filtered feedthroughs and ceramic capacitors contributed to this sales increase due partly to the acquisition of a small manufacturer of ceramic capacitors used in a variety of high voltage applications  including commercial space  defense and medical equipment  which was combined with the ceramic capacitor product lines in our carson city  nevada facility 
partially offsetting the increased product sales  revenue from licenses and collaborative agreements decreased to million in the fiscal year ended july  from million in the fiscal year ended july  i bus phoenix power and computing systems 
for the year ended december   i bus phoenix sales decreased million  or  to million from sales of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   foreign sales represented of our total sales in this segment compared to for the year ended december  domestic sales in this segment are made principally to oem customers and are primarily derived from the shipment of power and computing systems that are designed in to the oems products 
beginning in  we strengthened the international presence of this segment through the acquisition of applied computing businesses in england and germany and through the inception of operations in france 
to date  these european businesses have focused primarily on lower priced standard products 
the decrease in sales for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a decline in revenues from our oem supply agreement with siemens electrocom lp and the united states postal service  which concluded in the third quarter of and was winding down during this supply agreement contributed sales of million in the year ended december   compared to sales of million in excluding sales from this supply agreement  sales for this segment in were million  or approximately the same as sales of million for excluding the major supply agreement  sales decreased in the applied computing product lines of this segment during the current year due primarily to the phase out of certain marginal older technology product lines without a comparable contribution in the current year from new products  which were introduced beginning in the first quarter of offsetting reduced applied computing sales  sales within the power quality product lines of this segment increased during the current year 
in the five months ended december   sales in this segment totaled million 
in the fiscal year ended july   i bus phoenix sales increased million  or  to million from million in the fiscal year ended july  the increase in sales in the fiscal year ended july   was partly attributable to an increase in european sales due to the expansion of our applied computing businesses in germany and france and the contribution of sales from our united kingdom applied computing operation  which was acquired in the fiscal year ended july  in addition  sales increased in the fiscal year ended july  in both the segment s power quality product lines  following the february acquisition of phoenix power systems  inc  and its applied computing product lines due to new design in wins for customized oem products  including the major supply agreement with siemens electrocom lp and the united states postal service 
partially offsetting these increases was the completion in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended july  of sales to a single  long standing oem customer under a multi year program and the curtailment at the end of the fiscal year ended july  of a program with digital equipment corporation due to its acquisition by compaq computers 
while this segment does market certain standard products  and the segment continues to expand its presence in europe  sales under large oem programs remain a critical element of this business 
as a current enhancement of our marketing strategy  we have engaged a network of independent sales representatives in the united states and certain territories outside of the united states with the dual aim of generating direct sales  as well as leads for additional oem design in opportunities 
in addition  the recent integration of our applied computing and power quality businesses should improve the international sales of the power quality products and services by providing access to the segment s existing international sales channels to those product lines 
if sales of oem products do not achieve the levels projected by the oem  or if oem projects are curtailed due to consolidations or other market conditions  we may be unable to offset such loss of sales 
gross profit in the year ended december   our gross profit was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the year ended december  gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted in the year ended december  by reduced sales volume in the year  primarily during the third quarter of  which was inadequate to fully absorb fixed manufacturing costs 
in addition  the reduced gross profit in the current year reflects costs incurred in the current year in connection with training personnel in improved manufacturing processes and certain write offs of inventories related to discontinued product lines or deemed excess or obsolete 
in the five months ended december   our gross profit was million  or of sales  a substantial decrease from prior years 
reduced sales volumes  decreases in high margin revenues from licenses and other collaborative agreements  and certain write offs of inventories determined to be excess or obsolete were the primary reasons for the reduced gross margins during the five months ended december  in the fiscal year ended july   our gross profit increased million  or  to million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended july  as a percentage of sales  gross profit was in the fiscal year ended july  compared to in the fiscal year ended july  reductions in gross margins as a percentage of sales from the fiscal year ended july  to the fiscal year ended july  resulted from a combination of factors  including an increase in revenues from sales of applied computing systems with significant third party content  upon which lower overall gross profit margins are realized  a decrease in high margin development funding and technology license fees  and changes in the mix of products and services sold 
we believe that our improved manufacturing and other operational capabilities obtained through the completion of the restructuring plan in october  will result in improved gross margins in future periods 
gross profit within each of our continuing business segments is as follows electronic components group 
in the year ended december   gross profit in the electronic components group segment increased by million  or  to million from million in the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  gross profit improved to in the current year from in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit for the current year is the result of increased sales volume and an improved cost structure  primarily in our microelectronics and powercache product lines  offset by a reduction in gross margins associated with revenue from licenses and other collaborative agreements and by costs incurred in connection with training personnel in improved manufacturing processes and certain write offs of inventories related to discontinued product lines or deemed excess or obsolete 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales also reflects the increased sales volume and the impact of the process and cost improvements in this business segment 
in our powercache ultracapacitor product line  we continue to make required infrastructure and other investments which negatively impact gross profit at current sales volumes 
although gross margins have improved in the powercache business  such margins continue to reduce the overall gross margins for the electronic components group segment 
gross profit for the electronic components group segment was million in the five months ended december   or of sales 
gross profit in this segment was significantly impacted in the five months ended december  by unabsorbed overhead and other production costs in the powercache ultracapacitor business area  which was in the start up phase of volume production  resulting in negative gross margins 
in addition  this business area received no contribution in the five months ended december  from high margin revenue from licenses and other collaborative agreements 
low sales volumes in the other electronic components group business areas also contributed to reduced gross margins in the five months ended december  in addition  charges were recorded in our filtered feedthrough  ceramic capacitors and microelectronics product lines in the five months ended december  to write off certain inventories deemed excess or obsolete  also impacting gross margins 
in the fiscal year ended july   electronic components group gross profit decreased million to million from million in the fiscal year ended july  as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit primarily reflected a decrease in high margin development funding and technology license fees of million  and also reflected a lower margin mix of products and services 
this decrease also reflected changes in our pricing strategies in response to competitive pressures  as we continued to improve our penetration in various markets 
i bus phoenix power and computing systems 
in the year ended december   i bus phoenix gross profit decreased by million  or  to million from million in the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in the current year  as compared to in the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the impact of reduced sales volume for this segment in the current year 
in addition  this segment has experienced a change in product mix to include a higher proportion of lower margin power quality products  as compared to higher margin applied computing solutions 
the reduced gross profit in the current year also reflects costs incurred in the current year in connection with training personnel in improved manufacturing processes and certain write offs of inventories related to discontinued product lines or deemed excess or obsolete 
in the five months ended december   i bus phoenix gross profit totaled million  or of sales  representing a decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales from prior periods 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a lower margin mix of product sales in the five months ended december  and certain write offs of excess and obsolete inventories 
in the fiscal year ended july   i bus phoenix gross profit increased million  or  to million from million in the fiscal year ended july  as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in the fiscal year ended july  from in the fiscal year ended july  this decrease was primarily due to a change in sales mix which  in the fiscal year ended july   included certain higher margin products that were near the end of their life cycle  with no such sales in the fiscal year ended july  in addition  a higher proportion of our revenues in the fiscal year ended july   were derived from contracts which include applied computing systems with greater third party content  upon which lower overall gross profit margins were realized 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december   our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million from million in the year ended december  as a percentage of total sales  these expenses decreased to in the year ended december   from in the year ended december  we are continuing to focus on opportunities to decrease our selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the five months ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of sales 
the increase in these expenses was primarily in support of our continuing growth and the continuing expansion into europe by i bus phoenix 
the five months ended december  also included  of severance costs related to our former ceo 
in the fiscal year ended july   our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million in the fiscal year ended july  as a percentage of total sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in the fiscal year ended july  from in the fiscal year ended july  the increase in these expenses was primarily in support of our sales growth  including the businesses acquired in the fiscal years ended and in addition  we made certain investments related to administrative infrastructure and in administrative and sales support which increased the expenses as a percentage of sales 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses reflect internally funded research and development programs 
research and development expenses were million  or of sales  for the first three years ended december   as compared to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  we have increased our level of spending in research and development to accelerate new product introductions and we expect this level of spending to remain at increased levels in future periods 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the five months ended december  and the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses were in the five months ended december   in the fiscal year ended july   and in the fiscal year ended july restructuring  acquisition and other charges in connection with the restructuring plan  we undertook various actions to improve our cost structure 
as a result  we recorded restructuring and other related charges of million during the first three quarters of the year ended december  these charges included severance costs related to reductions in personnel  costs associated with the closure and combination of certain facilities and the write off of non performing operating assets 
we completed the facilities and organizational consolidation program started as part of our restructuring plan and do not expect to record any additional charges related to the restructuring plan 
in the three months ended september   we also recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill related to our acquisition of phoenix power systems  inc to an amount representative of the current appraised value of that asset 
also  in the three months ended september   we recorded a charge of million related to in process technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of gateworks corporation in september we also recorded restructuring and other related charges in connection with the restructuring plan in the five months ended december  totaling approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended july   we recorded restructuring  acquisition and other charges of approximately million 
of these charges  approximately million consisted of direct acquisition costs for business combinations accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
the remaining million charge consisted primarily of amounts provided for revised estimates of costs to resolve certain environmental and legal contingencies which occurred in prior years  as well as other restructuring provisions  including employee and facility expenses  related to decisions made in july to reduce certain administrative infrastructure in europe and the united states 
we recorded a million charge in the fiscal year ended july  related to the acquisition of two businesses  including transaction costs for a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interest  and the appraised amount of acquired in process research and development for the business combination accounted for as a purchase 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
the increased interest expense relates to higher borrowing levels in the current year compared to the prior year 
at december   we had million outstanding under our bank line of credit 
we expect borrowings and related interest expense to decrease in the second quarter of  following the sale of our defense contracting business by the end of march  the proceeds of which will be used to repay debt 
interest expense was   and  in the five months ended december  and in the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  consisting primarily of interest income  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and gains and losses on dispositions of fixed assets  was  in the year ended december  and  in the year ended december  interest income has decreased reflecting lower average cash balances in the year ended december  interest income and other  net  was   and million in the five months ended december  and in the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income reflects lower average cash balances in both the five months ended december  and in the fiscal year ended july  during the fiscal year ended july   we received proceeds of approximately million from a follow on offering of our common stock 
such cash proceeds were used to fund growth in operations and acquisitions through december  provision credit for income taxes the credit for income taxes for the year ended december  reflects our expected world wide tax rate for the current fiscal year 
our effective tax rate was reduced by the fact that no tax credit was provided for the million charge recorded to reduce the carrying value of goodwill since that amount will never be deductible for tax purposes 
in future years  we will continue to provide income taxes approximating applicable statutory rates  although cash payments for taxes will be substantially lower in the near term as tax loss carryforwards are utilized 
we have net deferred tax assets of approximately million at december   which relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards that we expect to use as a result of expected gains on dispositions of discontinued operations and future income from operations 
for the year ended december   our credit for income taxes included a credit of million  representing the reversal of a valuation allowance provided in previous years against certain deferred tax benefits 
the valuation allowance was reversed based on our determination that it had become more likely than not that such deferred tax benefits will be realized in the future 
the deferred income tax credit was partially offset by certain foreign and state income tax expense 
the credit for income taxes in the five months ended december  reflected our expected world wide tax rate for that period 
the credit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended july  includes the credit of million  discussed above  representing the reversal of a valuation allowance provided in previous years against certain deferred tax benefits 
our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended july  related primarily to taxes of the businesses acquired in the fiscal year ended july  using the pooling of interests method 
minority interest in net income loss of subsidiaries minority interest in net income loss of subsidiaries was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the reduction in our net loss results from losses incurred by our minority owned subsidiaries 
minority interest in net income loss of subsidiaries was not material in the five months ended december  or in the fiscal years ended july  and income loss from continuing operations as a result of the factors mentioned above  income loss from continuing operations was million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the factors mentioned above  the income loss from continuing operations was million for the five months ended december   compared to million and million in the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
discontinued operations in connection with the restructuring plan  we divested three of our businesses in our high voltage wound film capacitors  high voltage power supplies  and time card and job cost accounting software businesses 
in february  we sold the high voltage wound film capacitors and high voltage power supplies businesses for cash of million  approximately the book value of the net assets sold as of that date 
in addition  the buyer assumed certain liabilities of the businesses  including a long term lease for the facility the businesses occupied  which extended through with annual rent of approximately million 
in november  we sold our time card and job cost accounting software business for cash of million and shares of common stock of the buyer with an immaterial value 
in the fourth quarter of  we also received cash of approximately million related to our equity investment in an unconsolidated entity  which was classified as a discontinued operation 
in december  we recorded provisions of approximately million  net of tax  for estimated losses on the sale of these discontinued businesses 
based on the actual proceeds received and the net assets of the discontinued businesses at their respective dates of sale  we reversed the provisions we estimated in december and recorded an aggregate gain on these sales of million  net of tax  including the reversal 
in late  we decided to focus on our electronic components group and i bus phoenix businesses 
accordingly  in late  we offered for sale our defense contracting business and signed letters of intent to sell the business in separate transactions with two buyers 
both transactions are expected to be completed by march  also  we are now seeking strategic alternatives for our purepulse business  which we expect will result in the sale of all or a majority of the business in accordingly  both the defense contracting business and purepulse have been classified as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
income loss from operations of these discontinued businesses was million in the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million  million and million for the five months ended december  and the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
the income from operations of the discontinued businesses for the year ended december  and the fiscal year ended july  includes a million tax credit representing the reversal of an income tax valuation allowance provided in previous years against certain deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically relied on a combination of cash on hand  internally generated funds  proceeds from sales of stock and bank borrowings to finance our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
in the fiscal year ended july   we received cash of million in connection with a public offering of our stock 
in addition  in the fiscal years ended july  and december   we received approximately million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans 
cash used by continuing operations in the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to million in the year ended december  in the current year  the use of cash was primarily attributable to operating losses  cash expenditures in connection with completing our restructuring plan and certain increases in working capital 
capital expenditures in the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the capital expenditures in include approximately million related to the design  construction  remodeling and outfitting of our manufacturing facilities 
the remaining expenditures relate primarily to other capital assets needed to support growth 
we have ordered additional equipment for volume manufacturing of ultracapacitors and for the manufacture of emi filter capacitors 
we may also consider leasing facilities or manufacturing equipment  or both  or may satisfy high volume manufacturing requirements through outsourcing or under licensing arrangements with third parties 
if we decide to construct additional facilities or purchase high volume manufacturing equipment  a significant amount of capital may be required 
in the year ended december   we also received cash of million in connection with sales of businesses and used cash of million in connection with the payment of an earn out obligation related to a acquisition  and  of cash was paid in connection with the september acquisition of gateworks corporation 
cash used by continuing operations in the five months ended december  was approximately million  as compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in the five months ended december   the operating losses were partially offset by decreases in operating assets  primarily accounts receivable 
in the fiscal years ended july  and  the use of cash was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable and inventories  due both to acquired businesses and in support of increased sales 
our capital expenditures in the five months ended december  and in the fiscal years ended july  and were million  million and million  respectively  and related primarily to production and other capital assets needed to support growth in all of our business units 
we believe that funds on hand  together with cash generated from operations  cash expected to be received from the divestiture of certain businesses and funds available under our bank credit agreement  will be sufficient to finance our operations and our capital expenditures for  as well as finance remaining payments required in connection with the restructuring plan 
in addition to addressing manufacturing requirements  we may also  from time to time  consider acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional funding 
sources of additional funding for these purposes could include cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  borrowings under the existing bank credit agreement  and additional debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional sources of financing on favorable terms  if at all  at such time or times as we may require such capital 
we had borrowings of million outstanding under a bank credit agreement as of december  the bank was repaid in full with proceeds of our new bank credit agreement and the old agreement was terminated effective february  our bank debt will be reduced following the sale of our defense contracting business  which is expected to be completed by march  new bank credit agreement in february  we and all of our us subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement with comerica bank california 
the agreement consists of a million term loan and a revolving credit facility 
the term loan is due on the earlier of june   or the date we complete the sale of our defense contracting business 
if we sell only part of this business for proceeds less than that necessary to repay the term loan  we must make a partial payment on the term loan 
the term loan bears interest at the bank s reference rate  plus 
if we fail to repay the term loan by june   we must grant comerica bank a security interest in our real property  and we will need to negotiate with the bank a new due date  payment schedule and other terms 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate such terms on a favorable basis 
the current borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is determined from a borrowing base  consisting of a portion of our accounts receivable and inventory  but the total availability will not exceed million 
after we sell our defense contracting business  repay the term loan and have a profit for one fiscal quarter  the availability under the revolving credit facility will be million and will no longer be determined from a borrowing base 
amounts borrowed as revolving loans bear interest  at our option  at either the bank s reference rate plus  or the libor rate plus 
we may prepay revolving loans at any time  and all amounts borrowed are due on may  on march   million was outstanding under the term loan and million was outstanding under the revolving facility 
the bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants and certain restrictions on our ability to sell assets  engage in mergers or acquisitions  incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock 
as of the date of this form k  we are in compliance with all required covenants 
the bank credit facility is secured by all of our assets in the united states  except for our real property  and the pledge of two thirds of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
minority equity interests in subsidiaries and subsidiary option programs each of the electronic components group  i bus phoenix and purepulse have minority equity investors 
these investors are former strategic partners associated with relationships established in the past  former shareholders of companies acquired using our subsidiaries stock and former and current employees who have exercised stock options in those entities 
as of december   minority investors owned  of the outstanding shares  approximately of the electronic components group  of i bus phoenix and percent of purepulse 
in addition  each such subsidiary has an employee stock option plan that permits the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase subsidiary common stock 
the option programs at i bus phoenix and at purepulse are active and the electronic components group program is not active  although options issued previously remain outstanding 
as of mid  key employees of i bus phoenix and purepulse are eligible for option grants in their respective subsidiary plans and are not eligible for grants at the parent company level 
key parent company and electronic components group employees are eligible for option grants at the parent company level  but not in any subsidiaries 
the option plans are intended to encourage an entrepreneurial atmosphere in each business segment  providing focused incentives to appreciate the equity value of each business 
options that are in the money at the subsidiary level will have a negative impact on our earnings per share 
we expect to report diluted earnings per share in future quarters due to in the money subsidiary options 
except to the extent exercised  however  such subsidiary options will not affect our consolidated net income as reported in our consolidated statement of operations 
such options  when and if exercised  will dilute our actual ownership interest in our subsidiaries  thus reducing our share of the net income  potential dividends or distributions and proceeds of any sale or other disposition of such subsidiary 
the equity interest upon exercise of stock options in the subsidiaries is accounted for as a minority interest 
at december   the potential percentage ownership interest attributable to exercisable subsidiary options was  on a diluted basis  approximately of the electronic components group  percent of i bus phoenix and of purepulse 
inflation and changes in prices generally  we have been able to increase prices to offset inflation related increased costs in our commercial businesses

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities later amended by statement nos 
and  which we are required to adopt beginning january  statement no 
requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of the derivative 
because we make minimal use of derivatives and hedges  we do not anticipate that the adoption of statement no 
will have a significant effect on the results of operations or our financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have not entered into or invested in any instruments that are subject to market risk  except as follows 
we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary foreign currency exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe 
as a result of our international operations  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the united states dollar amount of our revenue and expenses 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at december   we had million outstanding related to variable rate u 
s dollar denominated short term debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  annual interest expense on our short term borrowings  if the amount outstanding remained unchanged  would increase by approximately
