item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the sections entitled business and risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements 
overview we are a research based diagnostics company dedicated to the discovery and development of novel protein based tests that improve a physician s ability to diagnose disease 
we combine separate  yet integrated  discovery and diagnostics businesses to access proteomics research  identify proteins with high diagnostic utility  develop and commercialize products and educate the medical community on new approaches to diagnosis 
we believe our products  which are aimed primarily at the diagnosis of catastrophic diseases  positively impact medical decisions  improve the quality of patient care and contribute to cost effective medical treatment 
our diagnostics business is a leading provider of rapid tests that aid in the diagnosis of a variety of critical diseases 
these tests are sold worldwide primarily for use in emergency departments  although we believe that in the future certain tests may have applications in other clinical sites 
our two product platforms are designed to provide rapid results through either qualitative visual readings or quantitative meter readings 
these platforms are based upon our proprietary technologies in the areas of antibody development  signaling chemistry and micro capillary fluidics 
our testing formats are designed to measure single analyte targets or multiple analytes simultaneously 
they also allow for the analysis of various sample sources  including urine  serum  plasma  whole blood and stool 
among the products expected to contribute most significantly to product revenue in the future are the triage drugs of abuse panel  the triage cardiac system and the triage bnp test 
in  we launched our first product  the triage panel for drugs of abuse  a small  self contained  qualitative test capable of detecting within urine a broad spectrum of commonly overdosed prescription and illicit drugs within approximately minutes 
results from the triage panel for drugs of abuse enable physicians to differentiate drug overdose from other conditions with similar symptoms 
currently  the triage panel for drugs of abuse is used in approximately  of us acute care hospitals 
net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel were approximately million in in  we completed the national launch of our first quantitative product  the triage cardiac system 
the triage cardiac system  comprised of the triage cardiac panel and the triage meter  is designed to measure three cardiac proteins  ckmb  myoglobin and troponin i  within minutes using a whole blood sample 
the triage cardiac system aids in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction  or ami  commonly known as heart attack  by enabling physicians to easily and frequently monitor changes in the levels of these proteins  which rise as heart damage occurs 
access to this information provides physicians with an enhanced ability to make treatment decisions in a timely manner 
the triage cardiac system is in the early stages of market penetration  with approximately customers using the system at year end net worldwide sales of the triage cardiac system were million in in  we received fda approval to market the triage bnp test  the first blood test approved in the united states as an aid in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure 
the triage bnp test measures levels of b type natriuretic peptide  or bnp  a hormone that is elevated in patients suffering from heart failure 
physicians can use measurements of bnp to distinguish heart failure from other diseases with similar symptoms 
we believe that bnp may also be useful in evaluating treatment of existing patients and we intend to conduct clinical studies to further explore this application 
we commenced marketing of the triage bnp test in december historically  the market has been slow to adopt new protein markers and requires significant validation in the form of published studies 
accordingly  we expect sales to be less than million 
however  we do believe that the long term growth prospects for this product are significant 
the principal market for our products is comprised of hospitals  which number approximately  in the united states 
we focus our efforts on larger centers and aim to place our products in emergency departments and other point of care locations  as well as in laboratories 
in marketing our products we utilize a direct sales team that includes general account executives and cardiovascular account executives  who have extensive experience selling cardiovascular devices or drugs 
the fisher healthcare division fisher of the fisher scientific company distributes our products in us hospitals and supports our direct sales force  particularly in smaller hospitals 
in international markets  we utilize a network of country specific and regional distributors 
our product sales to date have primarily been attributed to sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel product line 
the triage drugs of abuse panel products are marketed pursuant to distribution agreements in the us hospital market segment by fisher healthcare  or fisher  which accounted for and of our product sales in and  respectively  and internationally by country specific and regional distributors 
since its launch in fiscal  the triage drugs of abuse panel product line has experienced continued annual revenue growth 
we believe  however  that domestic sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel products may decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more prominent in a maturing market 
in addition to focusing our attention on commercial activities associated with existing products  we are investing in discovery efforts aimed at finding proteins with high diagnostic utility 
in march  we launched biosite discovery  a collaborative research business dedicated to the identification of new protein markers for acute diseases 
through biosite discovery  we conduct analyses on both known proteins that may be markers of disease and potential markers accessed from partners in order to determine diagnostic utility 
we refer to this process as marker mining 
if the diagnostic utility of a marker is established  it will then be assessed for commercialization potential  with high value markers being added to our product development pipeline 
to gain access to novel proteins  we primarily leverage our expertise in phage display antibody development  providing pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners with high throughput development of high affinity antibodies for research use and seeking  in exchange  licenses to their protein targets in addition to fees 
under biosite discovery  we have executed collaborative agreements with partners in the areas of cardiovascular  cerebrovascular  infectious disease and oncology 
our collaborative partners include the timi group of brigham and woman s hospital  corixa corporation  diadexus llc  duke university  eli lilly  eos biotechnology inc  johns hopkins hospital  large scale biology corporation  medarex inc  morphosys ag  scios inc 
and the san diego va medical center 
in  these collaborations generated revenues of million 
in we entered into an agreement with medarex  inc through which we are combining our proprietary phage display technology with medarex s proprietary transgenic mouse technology to offer a process for high throughput development of high affinity fully human antibodies 
this process is being provided as a research service to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  which require high affinity fully human antibodies for use in conducting target validation and  or  characterization experiments 
under the terms of the eight year agreement  medarex will provide biosite with research funding of million per year 
when biosite and medarex enter into agreements to provide high affinity  fully human antibodies to third party biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers  we will generally receive a variety of payments and we will also seek exclusive or semi exclusive diagnostic rights to the protein targets provided to us by biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers 
among the payments we might receive are up front technology access fees  antibody development fees upon the delivery of antibodies  annual maintenance fees on targets for which biosite has produced antibodies for as long as the targets remain in development  milestone fees on drug targets that reach clinical milestones and royalties should products successfully be commercialized as a result of the collaboration 
in january  we initiated a technology alliance with lsbc  through its wholly owned proteomics subsidiary 
through this alliance we plan to generate the antibody and protein target components required to produce the first generation of commercial protein chips 
protein chips also called antibody arrays are research tools for measuring large numbers of proteins in biological samples and are expected to become the preferred technology for high volume applications such as clinical research  diagnostics and toxicology 
lsbc and biosite intend to pursue the protein chip market  with a sharing of rights and returns 
biosite will obtain certain diagnostic licenses to targets and lsbc will retain all other target rights  including uses in proteomics  database creation  and therapeutics 
biosite will receive antibody development fees as well as payments for certain products successfully developed through the joint research efforts 
if diagnostic products are successfully developed and commercialized  lsbc will receive milestone payments and royalties 
for six consecutive quarters to date  beginning with the second half of  we have generated operating profits  after incurring operating losses during the prior seven quarters 
we may not be able to maintain operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future and our operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
we anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us market acceptance of current or new products manufacturing inefficiencies progress of research and development projects including clinical trials and regulatory delays attainment of milestones under collaborative agreements necessary to earn contract revenues seasonal customer demand  the timing or cancellation of significant orders  product recalls and shipment problems changes in reimbursement policies competitive pressures on average selling prices changes in the mix of products sold 
operating results would also be adversely affected by a downturn in the market for our current and future products 
we continue to increase our operating expenses  primarily for personnel  capital equipment and activities supporting newly introduced products and product development 
our operating results would be adversely affected if our net sales or gross profit did not correspondingly increase or if our product development efforts were unsuccessful or subject to delays 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we may not sustain revenue growth or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis

product sales increased to million in from million in the increase in product sales was primarily attributable to the growth in net sales of our triage cardiac system  one of our quantitative platform products 
net sales of our quantitative platform products  consisting of the triage cardiac system and triage bnp system  were approximately million for  as compared to million for the triage cardiac system s net sales growth was primarily due to growth in our customer base and greater average product utilization by our customers 
net sales of our qualitative platform products  consisting of the triage drugs of abuse panel and triage microbiology panels  were approximately million for  compared to million for the growth in our qualitative platform products was primarily related to sales growth in the triage drugs of abuse panel 
net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel for increased million  or  as compared to we believe that the domestic sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel products may decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more prominent in a maturing market 
contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of revenues associated with our research and development and licensing arrangements  including license fees  milestone revenues  royalties  research funding and antibody fees derived from biosite discovery programs 
contract revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to  for contract revenues recognized during related primarily to the licensing of technology and performance of activities under biosite discovery collaborative research and development agreements 
in june  we entered into an alliance with medarex inc under the terms of the agreement  we will receive research funding of million annually over eight years from medarex  along with research fees and  if any products are generated through the collaboration  milestone payments and royalties 
we may also receive diagnostic rights to targets identified through the collaboration 
in exchange  we will make available certain of our biosite discovery research and development resources for collaborative research activities 
during  we recognized  in research funding directly from medarex under the collaboration 
the remainder of the contract revenue for related to research milestones achieved  license fees and antibody development fees 
contract revenue recognized during related to activities associated with a research and development feasibility study and biosite discovery research and development activities 
biosite discovery activities and its costs are performed by certain of our research and development teams 
these biosite discovery research and development resources concurrently focus on programs for our partners  which generated our contract revenue  and on internal r d programs 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million and million in and  respectively  and are included in research and development expenses 
cost of sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the overall product sales growth 
the overall gross margin increased to for from for the overall gross margin for increased primarily as a result of a greater manufacturing efficiency of our quantitative platform products  primarily the triage cardiac system  during as compared to during the first quarter of  we experienced significant inefficiencies related to the production of the triage cardiac panel  which resulted in an overall gross margin of during that quarter 
since the first quarter of  our overall quarterly gross margins have ranged between and 
during  our overall gross margin has increased as we have improved our manufacturing processes  increased manufacturing volumes of our triage cardiac panel and have experienced a slight increase in sales of our higher margin product  the triage drugs of abuse panel 
during  we were able to utilize some of our manufacturing resources for new product scale up and validation activities related to the triage bnp and triage lbp tests  two products that were under development 
the costs of new product scale up and validation activities were charged to research and development expenses  contributing to the gross margins 
our newer products are expected to continue to realize lower gross margins than the triage drugs of abuse panel during the early stages of their commercialization as incremental manufacturing costs are spread over smaller sales volumes and efficiency issues are addressed 
we also expect that the overall gross margins may continue to decrease as a result of competitive pricing pressures related to the maturing triage drugs of abuse product line and the changing mix of net sales of products with different gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in increases in sg a expenses were primarily associated with additional marketing activities relating to new products  the expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines and the increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations and business development activities 
sg a expenses for included administrative costs totaling approximately  associated with the reorganization of our manufacturing operations and costs totaling approximately  related to a business development opportunity that we decided to forego 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs in to be higher than in  as we continue to expand our overall operations  including sales and marketing activities for our new products  a larger direct sales force  business development activities and administrative support functions 
the timing of such increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our new products and the progress of business development activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  consistent with during  our research and development resources were focused primarily on the biosite discovery activities activities related to the gathering of additional data needed for the approval of our triage bnp test  which was approved in november clinical studies and the development of potential improvements to our existing and new products 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in  as compared to levels 
the increased expenditures are expected to primarily relate to pre clinical and clinical studies  product development efforts  the expansion of the capacity of the biosite discovery program and manufacturing scale up activities 
the costs associated with the clinical trials are expected to be significant 
some of our potential products are subject to more complex regulatory approval requirements than our previous products 
the timing of the increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the progress and success of the research and development and the timing of potential product launches 
interest and other income net 
interest and other income increased to million in from million in the increase in interest income resulted primarily from the higher average balance of cash and marketable securities and higher overall interest rates on marketable debt securities during as compared to during the fourth quarter of  we decided to sell one of our marketable debt securities that had fallen below our investment guidelines 
the security was sold in january and resulted in a  realized loss  which was accrued at december  as a permanent decline in value of the security 
benefit provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax income and the estimated tax credits generated in each year  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for and a benefit for income taxes of  for the benefit for income taxes recognized in the fourth quarter of included  of benefit resulting from the recognition of research and development credits generated during the first three quarters of at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of approximately million 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur which do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and product sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the growth in net sales of new products 
the triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were launched in march and october  respectively 
the triage cardiac system was introduced in may new product sales for were approximately million  as compared to million for net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel for were higher than net sales of the product for contract revenue 
contract revenue decreased to  in from million in contract revenues recognized during related to activities associated with a research and development feasibility study being performed by us and research and development activities related to biosite discovery 
in  we recognized million from kyoto dai ichi kagaku c  ltd  or kdk  related to milestones achieved in the development of the triage cardiac system  million from novartis related to milestones achieved in the development of the neoralchek system and  related to an sbir small business innovation research grant from the us government for research related to potential microbiology products 
cost of sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the overall sales growth and the realization of higher gross margins in as compared to for our newer products 
the overall gross margin decreased to for from for the overall gross margin for decreased primarily as a result of a greater proportion of net sales representing the newer products  which experienced lower gross margins than the triage doa panel 
also  during the first quarter of  we experienced significant inefficiencies related to the production of the triage cardiac system  resulting in negative gross profits related to that product during that quarter 
gross margins increased to profitable levels during the remaining quarters of  primarily as a result of efficiencies achieved in the manufacturing operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in increases in sg a expenses were primarily associated with additional marketing activities relating to new products  the expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines and the increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations and business development activities 
additionally  sg a expenses for included administrative costs associated with the reorganization of our manufacturing operations totaling approximately  and costs related to a business development opportunity that we decided to forego totaling approximately research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in significant manufacturing scale up and validation expenses were incurred during related to the triage cardiac system and triage microbiology panels 
the triage cardiac system was the first product on our new quantitative product platform and required significant investments in the scale up and validation of its manufacturing and quality processes 
manufacturing scale up and validation expenses decreased during the decreases in manufacturing scale up and validation costs were offset by increases in other product development expenses 
during  our research and development resources were focused primarily on the development  clinical studies  manufacturing scale up and validation of products under development  potential improvements to our existing products and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
defense of patent matters 
legal expenses associated with the dade behring and spectral diagnostics litigation totaled million in in february  a settlement agreement was executed that resolved all disputes between spectral diagnostics and us without a material adverse financial impact to us 
in march  to avoid protracted litigation and continued significant legal defense costs  we executed a settlement agreement with dade behring that resolved all disputes outstanding between the companies 
accordingly  all settlement costs were known prior to filing our form k and therefore were expensed as of december  interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased to million in from million in interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from the lower average balance of cash and marketable securities and lower overall interest rates on marketable debt securities during as compared to benefit provision for income taxes 
for and  as a result of the pre tax income loss and the estimated tax credits generated in each year  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  and million  respectively 
the benefit for income taxes recognized in the fourth quarter of included  of benefit resulting from the recognition of research and development credits generated during the first three quarters of liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through revenues from operations  private and public placements of equity securities  debt and capital lease financing  cash received under collaborative agreements and interest income 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to cash generated from the operating activities of million  the receipt of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans  and the receipt of million in proceeds from equipment financing 
significant uses of cash during included the purchase of leasehold improvement and capital equipment of approximately million  principal payments under equipment financing obligations of million  and investments in patents  license rights  deposits  and other assets of million 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to the net payment of approximately million made to dade behring as part of the settlement of litigation between dade behring and biosite in march and an additional million payment made under a technology licensing arrangement previously entered into 
other significant uses of cash included the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million and principal payments under equipment financing obligations of million 
these significant uses of cash were offset by the cash generated from operating activities of million  proceeds from equipment financing of million and issuances of common stock under our stock plans of million 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for the support of our commercialization efforts related to new products  expansion of our manufacturing capacity and efficiency for new products  expansion of our biosite discovery antibody research capacity  and the continued advancement of research and development efforts 
we executed agreements to license technologies patented by others that call for milestone payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we may enter into additional licensing agreements that may include up front and annual cash payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we utilized and may continue to utilize credit arrangements with financial institutions to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
additionally  we may utilize cash generated from operating activities  if any  to meet our capital requirements 
we believe that our available cash  cash from operations and funds from existing credit arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy our funding needs for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our new products and products under development are successfully developed  gain market acceptance and become and remain competitive the costs and timing of further expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  expansion of our biosite discovery capacity and facilities expansion needs the timing and results of clinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our potential products changes in third party reimbursement policies  and the costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies patented by others 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily from its variable rate long term debt arrangements and  to a lesser extent  our investments in available for sale marketable securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we do have the option to convert our variable rate long term debt arrangements to fixed rate debt arrangements for a nominal transaction fee 
at december   we had variable rate debt totaling approximately  a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially effect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
additionally  our purchases of triage meters from lre technology partner gmbh  or lre  are denominated in german deutsche marks dm and sales of some products to some international customers are denominated in the local currency of customers 
we have on occasion purchased forward exchange contracts to manage this exposure to exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies at december  were not material
