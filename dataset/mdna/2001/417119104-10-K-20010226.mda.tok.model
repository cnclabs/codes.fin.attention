outlook during  the improved gross margin rate to sales and lower interest expense more than offset the pre tax earnings impact of the revenue decline 
fall and holiday apparel sales at retail were promotional and generally disappointing  suggesting a cautious outlook for fiscal  especially for the first half 
the company anticipates that fiscal revenue declines related to tailored suit units would be about offset by increases in tailored sportcoat and slack units along with other non tailored clothing product categories

the actions to eliminate lower margin potential products and programs within moderate tailored clothing product offerings favorably impacted operating margins  but were a contributing factor to the fiscal revenue decline 
while these actions are nearing completion  some additional reductions in domestic tailored clothing productive capacity are likely 
increasing demand for branded tailored sportcoat and dress slacks across most price points is alleviating the decline in advance orders and expected in stock tailored suit units 
product categories other than tailored clothing  such as sportswear from hickey freeman and hart schaffner marx  bobby jones and jack nicklaus golfwear and tommy hilfiger casual slacks represent important sources for future revenue and earnings growth

per share in the company s subordinated debentures  due in january   are callable at as of january   these debentures are expected to be retired with approximately million proceeds from new mortgage financing and utilizing availability under the company s credit facility 
the company anticipates that sufficient capital resources will be available to address growth opportunities generated internally or through acquisition 
increasing shareholder value through long term earnings growth remains a key objective  this would be achieved from a combination of revenue increases  improved operating margins and lower financing costs
