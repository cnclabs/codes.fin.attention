management believes that cash flow from operations  along with the company s ability to raise additional equity through joint ventures and anticipated sales of properties  additional proceeds from the sale of the remaining shares of common stock to lone star and the anticipated private placement securitization of the assets used to collaterize the bridge loan will provide the company with sufficient liquidity to meet its short term and long term capital needs 
however  there can be no assurances that the terms at which existing debt is refinanced will be as favorable to the company as under the existing facilities 
funds from operations ffo the company believes that it computes ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in their national policy bulletin dated november   which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the company s ffo is computed as net income loss available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excludes gains or losses from sales of property 
the company has restated ffo for all years presented prior to to reflect the adoption of this policy 
the company believes ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with the company s statements of financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  it provides investors with an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in evaluating ffo and the trends it depicts  investors should consider the major factors affecting ffo 
growth in ffo will result from increases in revenue or decreases in related operating expenses 
conversely  ffo will decline if revenues decline or related operating expenses increase 
ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligation  or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as an indication of the company s financial performance  to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united state of america or as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions

under the new legislation  reits may own stock in taxable reit subsidiaries  corporations that may provide services to tenants of the reit and others without disqualifying the rents that the reit receives from its tenants 
a taxable reit subsidiary is a corporation in which a reit owns stock  directly or indirectly  and with respect to which the corporation and the reit have made a joint election to treat the corporation as a taxable reit subsidiary 
although a reit may own up to of the stock of a taxable reit subsidiary  i the value of all securities in taxable reit subsidiaries held by the reit may not exceed of the value of the total assets of the reit  and ii any dividends received by the reit from its taxable reit subsidiaries will not constitute qualifying income under the income test 
in addition  the new legislation limits the deduction of interest paid by a taxable reit subsidiary to the reit and limits the amount of rental payments that may be made by a taxable reit subsidiary to the reit 
additionally  a reit will be prohibited from owning more than  by vote or by value  of the securities  other than specified debt securities  of a non reit c corporation 
this does not  however  apply to taxable reit subsidiaries  qualified reit subsidiaries and non qualified corporate subsidiaries in which the reit does not own more than of the voting securities  provided the non qualified subsidiary was established on or before july   does not engage in a new line of business or acquire any substantial asset other than pursuant to a binding contract in effect as of july   a tax free exchange  an involuntary conversion or a reorganization with another non qualified corporate subsidiary and the reit does not acquire any new securities in such subsidiary other than pursuant to a binding contract in effect as of july  or a reorganization with another non qualified corporate subsidiary 
under the new legislation  a reit may convert existing non qualified corporate subsidiaries into taxable reit subsidiaries in a tax free reorganization at any time prior to january  in addition under the new legislation  the distribution requirement is reduced to of reit taxable income 
also  the basis for determining whether more than of the rents is received by a reit from a property are attributable to personal property is based upon a comparison of the fair market value of the personal property leased by the tenant as compared to the fair market value of all of the property leased by the tenant  rather than the adjusted basis of such personal property compared to the adjusted basis of all such property 
inflation some of the company s leases are subject to adjustments for increases in the consumer price index  which reduces the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
additionally  to the extent inflation increases sales volume  percentage rents may tend to offset the effects of inflation on the company 
because triple net leases also require the restaurant operator to pay for some or all operating expenses  property taxes  property repair and maintenance costs including environmental costs and insurance  some or all of the inflationary impact of these expenses will be borne by the restaurant operator and not by the company 
operators of restaurants  in general  possess the ability to adjust menu prices quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit a restaurant operator s ability to raise prices in the face of inflation 
seasonality fast food restaurant operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher unit sales during the second and third quarters due to warmer weather and increase leisure travel 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenue to the extent it recognizes percentage rent
