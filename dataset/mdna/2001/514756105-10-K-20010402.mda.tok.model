item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview landacorp provides strategic healthcare management solutions to healthcare delivery and payer organizations 
our core internet and windows based medical management software is integrated with extensive predictive and preventive population health management programs and interactive media services to deliver comprehensive solutions that help manage and avoid cost  and enhance quality of healthcare 
our medical management software applications automate and streamline administrative and business processes and enable real time interaction among various healthcare participants 
our population health management solutions help our clients to deliver consistent and appropriate educational information to members of plans who have chronic or potentially high predicted expenditure outcomes associated with their illness 
as of december   payers who claim to have a combined membership of million participants were using our payer solutions  and approximately hospital providers were using our provider solutions 
we have historically derived revenues from the installation and licensing of our maxmc and maxsys solutions  sublicensing third party software applications as part of system implementations and delivery of post contract customer support  training and consulting services 
we are currently focusing our primary development  sales and marketing efforts on our e maxmc  maxmc  dsbuilder  dsmanager  managing for tomorrow and maxsys ii products 
although we do not anticipate future system sales or enhancements of maxsys i  we continue to provide maintenance services to  and receive maintenance fees from  customers who purchased this product in the past 
we plan to continue to support maxsys i for the foreseeable future as a service to such customers and pursuant to ongoing contractual obligations 
traditionally  we have recognized system sales revenues and associated costs using the percentage of completion method  with labor hours incurred relative to total estimated contract hours as the measure of progress towards completion 
we recognize revenues from sublicensing of third party software upon installation of such software 
we recognize revenues from support services ratably over the support period 
we recognize revenues from training and consulting as such services are delivered 
we introduced a new subscription based fee structure for our e maxmc and maxmc solutions during that provides for implementation services at a fixed hourly rate and the licensing of installed systems and post customer contract support through a monthly subscription fee based upon the number of members covered by the payer organization 
subscription based contracts allow us to recognize the fair value of the implementation services as such services are delivered and recognize subscription fees on a monthly basis 
with the acquisition of dsbuilder  dsmanager and managing for tomorrow products in november  we now have additional products for which revenue is recognized on a subscription fee based methodology 
the majority of dsbuilder and dsmanager revenue is recorded on a per member per month basis 
revenue received from our managing for tomorrow program is invoiced on a participant per year basis 
we expect to expand our operations and employee base  including our sales  marketing  research and development  implementation  and support services resources 
to accelerate the implementation of elements of our strategy  we intend to target and pursue strategic acquisitions and relationships  such as marketing alliances with vendors of complementary products and services and partnerships with internet providers of healthcare content  disease management and health related e commerce services 
investigating or entering into any such strategic relationships could lead to additional expenditures 
recent acquisitions on january   we purchased from high technology solutions  inc assets related to its business of providing web site services to healthcare payers 
the purchase price for the assets is  including an estimated  in assumed liabilities of which we paid  at the closing 
we paid the remaining balance in april the acquired assets include equipment  know how  trademarks and other intangible rights used by high technology solutions  inc in the operation of its business of providing web site services to healthcare payers  as well as contracts  none of which are material 
in connection with the acquisition we hired a number of former employees of high technology solutions  inc who we believe possess valuable expertise and relationships with potential healthcare payer customers 
we believe the acquisition benefits landacorp by providing us with valuable expertise and strategic relationships in the area of providing web site services to healthcare payers faster and more cost effectively than we would have been able to develop internally 
as a result  the acquisition will allow us to accelerate the implementation of our strategy of providing web site services to healthcare payers 
the purchase price of  including an estimated  in assumed liabilities has been allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the acquired intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of twenty four to thirty six months 
factors considered by the company in determining estimated useful lives of the intangible assets include  service life expectancies of the workforce based on anticipated option vesting schedules of eighteen months and other short lived incentive compensation arrangements  effects of obsolescence on intellectual property  and the effects of competition and other economic factors on goodwill  such as our intention to assimilate the acquired business into our operations rather than operate it as a separate business 
on october  we completed the acquisition of assets and liabilities of the promedex business from pmx holdings  inc promedex  a leading provider of population and disease management programs and services 
the total purchase price of  consisted of  cash   of the company s common stock  shares  other acquisition related expenses of approximately  consisting primarily of payment for legal and financial advisory services and the assumption of liabilities of  the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets  including existing technology  customer base  assembled work force  and goodwill 
on november  we completed the acquisition of patientcentrix  inc patientcentrix  a leading provider of population management targeting and intervention programs and services 
the company acquired of the shares and assumed all outstanding options of patientcentrix in return for cash of  paid to the stockholders and option holders  and issuing  shares to the stockholders of patientcentrix 
the price of the shares issued was based on the average of the previous trading days prior to the date of the definitive agreement  which was october  we also assumed all the incentive stock options issued by patientcentrix prior to the acquisition 
these now represent options to purchase up to  of common stock of landacorp with an average exercise price of 
the total purchase price of  consisted of  cash   of our common stock  shares  assumed stock options with a fair value of  and other acquisition related expenses of approximately  consisting primarily of payment for legal and financial advisory services 
of the total purchase price  approximately  was allocated to the net tangible assets  approximately  was allocated to unearned compensation related to our right to repurchase of the shares of the company s common stock and options to purchase our common stock issued to employees of patientcentrix pursuant to the purchase agreement in the event of such employee s termination under certain circumstances  and the remainder was allocated to intangible assets  including existing technology  customer base  assembled work force  and goodwill 
additionally  based on the total contract value of sales for patientcentrix software and services  capped at million in orders for the twelve months from the closing of the acquisition  up to million in additional cash will be paid to the shareholders and option holders of patientcentrix  prorata to their rights to patientcentrix stock 
results of operations the following table presents the statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues system sales and program services support services total revenues cost of revenues system sales and program services support services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net interest expense net loss comparison of years ended december    and revenues 
system sales and program service revenues and increased by  or from  in to  in and by  or to  in the increase in revenues between and resulted from growth in the volume of maxmc and maxsys ii contracts and an increase in the value of maxmc contracts 
we added additional revenue from operating the interactive health media group from february and dsbuilder  dsmanager and managing for tomorrow revenues from november in  one customer accounted for of system sales and program service revenues  in  two customers accounted for and of system sales and program service revenues in  two customers accounted for and of system sales and program service revenues 
support services revenues increased by  or from  in to  in and increased by  or to  in the increase from to in support service revenues resulted from an increase in the number of support contracts sold for completed maxmc and maxsys ii contracts  partially offset by declines in the number of maxsys i support customers 
cost of revenues 
cost of system sales and program services consists principally of costs incurred in the implementation of our software products  including personnel costs  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  non reimbursed travel expenditures  related department overhead  amortization of capitalized software development costs  costs of third party software products  and depreciation on equipment 
cost of system sales and program services increased by  or from  representing of system sales and program service revenues  in to  representing of system sales and program service revenues  in and by  or to  representing of system sales and program service revenues  in this cost increase resulted from an increase in personnel costs as we added employees to perform software implementations  stock based compensation expense further discussed below  and additional license fees that were paid to third party software vendors resulting from an increase in the volume of completed software contracts 
the increase in the gross margin on system sales and program services from in to in resulted from implementation efficiencies realized from the increased volume of software contracts  and the increased size of individual software contracts 
the decrease in gross margin on system sales and program services from in to in is attributable to revenue we did not recognize in the fourth quarter of the year while we expensed all the costs associated with that customer 
this was in connection with the signing an agreement with one of our customers that constituted a deferred payment plan and we felt that the appropriate treatment for that plan was to recognize the revenue on a cash received basis going forward 
we expect that cost of system sales and program service revenues will continue to increase as we add personnel to meet anticipated increases in contract volume and integrate our dsbuilder  dsmanager and managing for tomorrow products 
we cannot yet determine the impact of these increased costs on our gross margins  other than the impact of the deferred payment agreement will continue to put the gross margins under pressure for the first half of cost of support service revenues consists of personnel costs  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  support costs for third party software licenses  related department overhead and depreciation on equipment 
cost of support services revenues increased by  or from  representing of support services revenues  in to  representing of support services revenues  in and by  or to  representing of support system revenues  in this increase in dollars resulted from an increase in salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense further discussed below  and other personnel related expenses as we increased the size of the support services staff due to the increased volume of customers purchasing support contracts 
the increase in the gross margin on support services from during to during both and resulted from efficiencies realized from additional support contracts sold for completed maxsys ii and maxmc contracts 
we expect that cost of support services revenues will continue to increase in dollar amounts as we continue to expand our customer support department to meet anticipated customer demand 
we cannot yet determine the impact of these increased costs on our gross margins 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of personnel costs  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  related department overhead and depreciation on equipment 
research and development expenses increased by  or from  representing of total revenues  in to  representing of total revenues  in and by  or to  representing of total revenues  in this increase resulted from an increase in salaries  benefits and other personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense further discussed below  as we increased the size of the research and development staff 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and that such expenses will increase in dollar amounts 
we cannot yet determine the impact of these increased costs on our total operating expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist principally of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  advertising  trade show and other promotions  costs  and department overhead 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  or from  representing of total revenues  in to  representing of total revenues  in and by  or to  representing of total revenues  in this increase resulted from increased salaries  benefits and other personnel related expenses due to growth in the number of sales and marketing personnel  stock based compensation expense further discussed below  increases in sales commissions due to an increase in the volume of customer contracts  increases in travel costs due to the increased headcount  and increases in trade shows and other marketing expenses incurred to build additional product awareness 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in dollar amounts as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts  continue to add personnel and increase promotional activities 
we cannot yet determine the impact of these increased expenses on our total operating expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation for personnel  fees for outside professional services  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  and allocated occupancy and overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or from  representing of total revenues  in to  representing of total revenues  in and by  or to  representing of total revenues  in the increase was due to an increase in the number of employees  higher professional service fees  stock based compensation expense further discussed below  and increased occupancy costs due to the commencement of our atlanta office lease payment in december  for expanded facilities in chico  california in september  assuming additional premises in february associated with our interactive health media group and finally office space acquired with the population health management products that we acquired in october we also had additional expenses associated with operating as a public company in fiscal we believe that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as a result of our growing operations and the integration of the population health management and interactive health media groups for a full year in however  we cannot yet determine the impact of these increased expenses on our total operating expenses 
stock based expenses 
in connection with certain stock option grants and common stock issuances during the three years ended december   and  the company recognized unearned compensation totaling   and  net of  related to terminations  respectively 
the figure of  is net of a credit of  relating to employees who have left 
these costs are being amortized over the vesting periods or as the company s repurchase rights lapse see note of notes to financial statements  as applicable  using the multiple option approach prescribed by fin no 
amortization expense recognized during the years ended december   and  totaled   and  respectively  and has been allocated to cost of sales and operating expenses 
additionally  compensation expense of  was recorded during for stock sold at a discount to a third party consultant for services provided  and is included in general and administrative expense 
see note of notes to financial statements 
interest and other income and interest expense 
interest and other income consists primarily of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest and other income amounted to   and  for the year ended december   and  respectively 
interest income increased in primarily as a result of investing proceeds from the initial public offering in february interest expense decreased by  or from  in to  in and increased by  or to  in income taxes 
we recorded no current provision or benefit for federal or state income taxes for the years ended december   and  as we had incurred net operating losses and had no carryback potential 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately  and for state tax purposes of approximately  these federal and state tax loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income 
utilization of such carryfor wards may be limited in certain circumstances including  but not limited to  cumulative stock ownership changes of more than over a three year period and expire at varying amounts during the period from to we believe that there were cumulative changes of ownership of greater than in february accordingly  the amount of loss carryforwards that may be utilized to reduce future taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes will be limited 
the amount of the limitation has not yet been calculated 
we have not recognized a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
see note of notes to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations through net cash generated from operating activities  and private sales of common and preferred stock 
during february  we completed our initial public offering through which we raised net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital with outstanding debt totaling  net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in net cash provided by operating activities in consists of net losses before non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and increases to accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
net cash used to fund operating activities in reflects net losses before non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  increases in accounts receivable  increase in deferred revenue  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was  in and million in investing activities in consisted primarily of purchases of computer equipment  office furniture and leasehold improvements  and additions to capitalized software development costs 
investing activities in consisted primarily of the acquisition of three businesses see note to the company s financial statements  for which we paid approximately million  and for computer equipment  office furniture and leasehold improvements  and additions to capitalized software development costs 
net cash generated from financing activities was million in   in and million in net cash generated from financing activities in resulted from the issuance of preferred stock and common stock  partially offset by principal payments on stockholder notes payable 
net cash generated from financing activities in resulted from proceeds from long term debt and the issuance of common stock  partially offset by principal payments on long term debt 
net cash generated from financing activities in resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock  related to the initial public offering in february see note to the company s financial statements and the proceeds from long term debt  partially offset by principal payments on long term debt 
in february  we entered into an agreement with brian lang whereby the company agreed to pay a bonus of  to mr 
lang upon the successful completion of our initial public offering 
this amount was paid on march  following our initial public offering and the expense was recorded as operating expense for that period 
in february  we obtained a line of credit loc agreement that allows maximum borrowings of million 
the company was allowed to designate up to  of the maximum borrowings as a term note to finance purchases 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the loc agreement and  on the term note 
in october  the company fully paid the outstanding balance on the term note 
in january  we amended and restated the loc agreement by eliminating the term loan provision and certain covenant requirements 
advances on the loc agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  accrue interest at prime plus  and are due january at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the loc agreement 
we expect to experience significant growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
as a result  we anticipate that operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that available cash and cash equivalents and the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock in our recent offering will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
such additional financing may be unavailable  or if it is available  it may only be available on unreasonable terms and may be dilutive to our stockholders 
year compliance we have not experienced any material problems associated with the year recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards of derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas deferred the effective date until the first fiscal year beginning after june  we will adopt sfas in our quarter ending march  and do not expect such adoption to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we have adopted the provisions of sab  which had no material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb this interpretation clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
we have adopted the provisions of fin  which had no material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results we have a long history of losses and may never become profitable we have been in business since and we have incurred significant losses since that time 
we expect to continue to incur losses on an annual basis for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur increased levels of product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to increase our revenue significantly to achieve future profitability 
although our revenue has grown in recent quarters  we may not be able to sustain this growth and we may not realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
further  even if we achieve profitability  due to competition and the evolving nature of the healthcare information technology and internet market  we could fail to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have a history of quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenue and operating results  and expect these fluctuations to continue  which may result in volatility in our stock price our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which we cannot control 
the factors that may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate include fluctuations in demand for our medical management solutions and related services  including payers and providers reluctance to make large technology purchases around the time of the change to the year  the timing of customer orders and product implementations  particularly orders from large customers involving substantial implementation  the length of our sales cycle  which varies and is unpredictable  the length of our implementation process  which varies  is unpredictable and often depends on matters outside of our control such as the customer s ability to commit its resources to the implementation process  our ability to develop  introduce  implement and support new products and product enhancements  the rate of adoption of our medical management solutions  which often require our customers to change some aspects of the way in which they have traditionally conducted business  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors and deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products  services or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  and changes in the prices at which we can sell our medical management solutions 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any past periods as an indication of our future performance 
in some future periods  our operating results may not meet expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  our stock price may decline 
our business will suffer if our maxmc and e maxmc medical management solutions do not achieve widespread market acceptance among healthcare payer organizations achieving our growth objectives depends on our medical management solutions achieving widespread market acceptance among healthcare payer organizations  which is difficult to determine at this time 
we commercially released maxmc in and acquired dsbuilder  dsmanager  and managing for tomorrow in the fourth quarter of we only have payer customers currently use our solutions 
therefore  our solutions currently have limited market acceptance 
we have completed the installation of e maxmc at one client 
as a result  e maxmc has not achieved any market acceptance at this time and we currently do not have sufficient evidence to determine whether and to what extent it will achieve market acceptance 
achieving market acceptance for our medical management solutions will require ongoing improvement of their features and functionalities and enhanced sales and marketing efforts 
if we do not gain significant market share for our medical management solutions before our competitors introduce alternative products with features similar to ours  our operating results will suffer 
our operating results will also suffer if our pricing strategies  such as our planned subscription pricing for payers  are not economically viable or acceptable to our customers 
the healthcare industry may not accept our medical management solutions to be successful  we must attract a significant number of payer customers  such as managed care companies  and continue to attract provider customers  such as hospitals 
we cannot determine the extent to which the payer market will accept our medical management solutions as substitutes for traditional methods of processing healthcare information and managing patient care 
to date  many healthcare industry participants have been slow to adopt new technology solutions 
we believe that the complex nature of healthcare processes and communications among healthcare industry participants  as well as concerns about confidentiality of patient information  may hinder the development and acceptance of new technology solutions such as our medical management solutions 
in addition  customers using existing information systems in which they have made significant investments may refuse to adopt our solutions if they perceive that our solutions will not complement their existing systems 
as a result  the conversion from traditional methods of communication to electronic information exchange may not occur as rapidly as we expect it will 
even if the conversion does occur as rapidly as expected  payers and providers may use solutions  products and services offered by others 
because we offer a limited number of products and operate exclusively in the market for medical management solutions  we are particularly susceptible to competition  product obsolescence and downturns in the market for medical management products we depend on a limited number of products and we operate exclusively in the market for medical management solutions 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenue from the sale and associated support of maxsys ii and its predecessor maxsys i  a medical management solution marketed to hospital providers 
we anticipate that substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future will be attributable to continued sales and associated support of that solution  as well as sales and support of maxmc  e maxmc  dsbuilder  dsmanager  and managing for tomorrow  our medical management solutions marketed to payers 
dependence on a limited product line makes us particularly susceptible to the successful introduction of  or changes in market preferences for  competing products 
in addition  operating exclusively in the market for medical management solutions makes us particularly susceptible to downturns in that market that may be unrelated to the quality or competitiveness of our solutions 
if we do not hire and retain additional sales  marketing and implementation personnel we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategy and achieving our target revenue growth our future growth depends to a significant extent on our ability to hire additional sales  marketing and implementation personnel 
competition for these people is intense 
we have experienced difficulty in hiring qualified sales and marketing professionals  as well as database administrators  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such individuals 
if we do not hire additional qualified sales and marketing personnel  we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategy and our targeted revenue growth may not be achieved 
in addition  even if our sales increase  our market penetration and revenue growth will be limited if we are unable to hire additional personnel to implement the medical management solutions we sell 
we also believe that our success depends to a significant extent on the ability of our key personnel to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
many of our employees have only recently joined us  and we may experience high turnover rates in some categories of personnel 
if we do not assimilate new employees in a timely and cost effective manner  the productivity of those employees will be low  and as a result our operating results may decrease 
in addition  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
competitors or other companies may make such claims against us in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
any claim of this nature could result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
our future success depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers our executive officers have a great deal of experience in the healthcare information technology industry in general and in the market for medical management solutions in particular 
therefore  they are uniquely qualified to manage our business and would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with most of these officers or many of our other key personnel 
as a result  these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
the search for a replacement for any of our key personnel could be time consuming  and could distract our management team from the day to day operations of our business 
this could delay the implementation of our growth strategy and negatively impact our ability to achieve targeted revenue growth 
in addition  with the exception of two executive officers and one key employee  we do not maintain key person life insurance on our key personnel 
we do not believe that the departure of stephen kay  our chief financial officer and chief operating officer  will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
eugene cattarina  our chief executive officer  will act as interim chief operating officer  a position for which he is well qualified 
our new chief financial officer  mark rapoport  will join the company in april the length and complexity of our sales cycle and product implementation period may cause us to expend substantial time  effort and funds without receiving related revenue we do not control many of the factors that influence our customers buying decisions and the implementation of our medical management solutions 
the sales and implementation process for our solutions is lengthy  involves a significant technical evaluation and requires our customers to commit a great deal of time and money 
the sale and implementation of our solutions are subject to delays due to healthcare payers and providers internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and deploying new technologies within their organizations 
the sales cycle for our solutions is unpredictable and has generally ranged from six to twenty four months from initial contact to contract signing 
the time it takes to implement our solutions is also difficult to predict and has typically ranged from six to fifteen months from contract execution to the commencement of live operation 
during the sales cycle and the implementation period  we may expend substantial time  effort and money preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing the solution without receiving any related revenue 
our medical management solutions are complex and may contain undetected software errors  which could lead to an increase in our costs or a reduction in our revenues complex software products such as those included in our medical management solutions frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have  from time to time  found errors in the software products included in our solutions  and in the future we may find additional errors 
in addition  we combine our solutions with software and hardware products from other vendors 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in identifying the source of an error 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our solutions or another vendor s products  could cause sales of our solutions to decrease and our revenues to decline  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our technical personnel away from product development efforts  and cause significant customer relations problems 
because our medical management solutions rely on technology that we own  our business will suffer if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights to that technology against infringement by competitors to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property from infringement  other companies may use our intellectual property to offer competitive products at lower prices 
if we fail to compete effectively against these companies we could lose customers and sales of our solutions and our revenue could decline 
efforts to protect our intellectual property or our alleged misuse of the intellectual property of others may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation  we may be a party to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property of others 
these claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability or invalidate our ownership rights in the technology used in our solutions 
litigation  regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome  could consume a great deal of our time and money and would divert management time and attention away from our core business 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following stop using the challenged intellectual property or selling our products or services that incorporate it  obtain a license to use the challenged intellectual property or to sell products or services that incorporate it  which could be costly or unavailable  and redesign those products or services that are based on or incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could be costly and time consuming or could adversely affect the functionality and market acceptance of our products 
if we must take any of the foregoing actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our solutions  which would substantially reduce our revenue 
we face significant competition from  among others  software vendors  internet companies and consulting groups focused on the healthcare industry we face intense competition in the market for our medical management solutions 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we have 
because these organizations may be better known and have more customers than us  we may not compete successfully against them 
the principal companies we compete against in the payer market include hpr a subsidiary of mckesson hboc  meddecision  phycom  confer  american healthways  corsolutions and others 
in the hospital provider market  we compete against mids a division of affiliated computer systems  inc  softmed systems and others 
we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in the internet  information technology and healthcare industries 
rapidly changing technology may impair our ability to develop and market our medical management solutions because our business relies on technology  it is susceptible to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
in particular  the internet is evolving rapidly and the technology used in internet related products changes rapidly 
as the internet  computer and software industries continue to experience rapid technological change  we must quickly modify our solutions to adapt to such changes 
the demands of operating in such an environment may delay or prevent our development and introduction of new solutions and additional functions for our existing solutions that continually meet changing market demands and that keep pace with evolving industry standards 
moreover  competitors may develop products superior to our solutions  which could make our products obsolete 
our customers may encounter system delays  failures or loss of data when using our new internet based medical management solution as a result of disruptions or other problems with internet services and internet access provided by third parties system delays  failures or loss of data experienced by our customers could harm our business 
the success of our new internet based medical management solution for payers will depend on the efficient operation of internet connections among our payer customers and their members and associated providers 
these connections  in turn  depend on the efficient operation of web browsers  internet connections and internet service providers 
in the past  internet users have occasionally experienced difficulties with internet connections and services due to system failures 
any disruption in internet access provided by third parties could delay or disrupt the performance of our new internet based solution  and consequently  make it less acceptable to payers 
furthermore  we will depend on our customers hardware suppliers for prompt delivery  installation and service of the equipment that runs our applications 
security breaches and security concerns about internet transmissions may cause customers to refuse to purchase or discontinue the use of our medical management solutions our customers will retain confidential customer and patient information using our solutions 
an experienced computer user who is able to access our customers computer systems could gain access to confidential patient and company information 
therefore  our products must remain secure and the market must perceive them as secure 
the occurrence of security breaches could cause customers to refuse to purchase or discontinue use of our solutions 
protecting against such security breaches or alleviating problems caused by security breaches may require us to expend significant capital and other resources 
in addition  upgrading our systems to incorporate more advanced encryption and authentication technology as it becomes available may cause us to spend significant resources and encounter costly delays 
concerns over the security of the internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the market for our internet based medical management solution 
we operate in an industry subject to changing regulatory influences  which could limit the usefulness of our solutions or require us to make expensive and time consuming modifications to our products during the past several years  federal  state and local governments have increased their regulation of the us healthcare industry and have proposed numerous healthcare industry reforms 
these reforms may increase governmental involvement in healthcare  continue to reduce reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for our customers 
our customers may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding the proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our medical management solutions 
existing state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of healthcare information and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
congress is considering legislation and the department of health and human services has proposed regulations that would further regulate the confidentiality of healthcare information 
in addition  the department of health and human services has proposed regulations setting forth security standards for all health plans  clearinghouses and providers to follow with respect to healthcare information that is electronically transmitted  processed or stored 
while these laws and regulations may not apply to us directly  our products must comply with existing and future laws and regulations in order to achieve market acceptance 
such compliance may be difficult and expensive or even impossible to achieve 
these laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain  use or disseminate patient information  which in turn could limit the usefulness of our medical management solutions causing a decrease in our sales 
because of the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws and regulations with respect to the internet are becoming prevalent 
such new laws and regulations could limit the effectiveness and market acceptance of our internet based medical management solutions or could cause us to have to modify our solutions  which could be expensive and time consuming 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to large integrated healthcare delivery systems who may use their enhanced market power to force price reductions for our medical management solutions and related services many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  competition to provide products and services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with large industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
our operating results may suffer if we reduce our prices without achieving corresponding reductions in our expenses 
we may encounter acquisition related risks such as becoming responsible for unexpected liabilities of acquired businesses and difficulties integrating employees and operations of acquired businesses we expect to review opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies 
in connection with acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  or assume liabilities 
acquisitions could involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs or unexpected liabilities  diversion of our management s attention from our core business  interference with existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might purchase in the future 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power  which may limit our stockholder s ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other stockholder matters our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us 
if we do not meet our future capital requirements  we may be unable to develop or enhance our medical management solutions  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated events we believe that the net proceeds of our initial public offering  together with our existing cash balances  credit facilities and expected cash flow from operations  will allow us to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months 
however  we may need or want to seek additional capital prior to that time 
such capital may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
further  if we raise capital by issuing new equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms  we may not have the resources to develop new products or enhance existing products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated events 
our stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  failure to achieve  or changes in  financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements of new products or services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and life science industries  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our common stock  and developments regarding our patents or other intellectual property or that of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life science companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
there is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the nasdaq national market 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our stock is not active 
the large number of shares of our common stock which recently became eligible for public sale could cause our stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition  these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
all of the shares sold in our recently completed initial public offering will be freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the securities act  except for any shares purchased by our affiliates  as defined in rule of the securities act 
the remaining shares of common stock outstanding will be restricted securities as defined in rule these shares may be sold in the future without registration under the securities act  to the extent permitted by rule or other exemptions under the securities act 
on april   we registered  shares of common stock that are reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
on march   we registered an additional  shares of common stock that are reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock option plan 
these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while  at the same time  maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality money market accounts that invest in debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in money market accounts that invest only in short term securities that maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
as a result  we do not believe we are subject to significant rate risk
