item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended march   and the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  customer demand for our products and services  supplier costs  interest rate fluctuations and differences between estimated residual values and actual amounts realized related to the equipment we lease 
operating results could also fluctuate as a result of the sale of equipment in our lease portfolio prior to the expiration of the lease term to the lessee or to a third party 
such sales of leased equipment prior to the expiration of the lease term may have the effect of increasing revenues and net earnings during the period in which the sale occurs  and reducing revenues and net earnings otherwise expected in subsequent periods 
in november  we introduced eplussuite  a comprehensive business to business electronic commerce supply chain management solution for information technology and other operating resources 
we currently derive the majority of our revenue from sales and financing of information technology and other assets 
the introduction of eplussuite reflects our transition to a business to business electronic commerce solutions provider from our historical sales and financing business 
our strategy is to reduce or eliminate our balance sheet risk over time by outsourcing lease and other financing to third party financial institutions  while charging a transaction fee and arranging the sales of information technology and other assets for a transaction fee  rather than purchasing and reselling such assets ourselves 
we expect our electronic commerce revenues to be derived primarily from amounts charged to customers with respect to procurement activity executed through procure  fees from third party financing sources that provide leasing and other financing for transactions that we arrange through procure on behalf of our customers  fees from third party vendors for sales in transactions that we arrange through procure on behalf of our customers and amounts charged to customers for the manage service 
we expect to generate increased revenues from our electronic commerce business unit  while revenues from our leasing and sales business may decrease over time 
because revenues for the sale of leased and other equipment include the full purchase price of the item sold  total revenues may decline to the extent leasing and sales revenues begin to represent a smaller portion of our total revenues 
however  in the near term  as we seek to implement our electronic commerce business strategy  we will continue to derive most of our revenues from our traditional businesses 
we expect to incur substantial increases in the near term in our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
in particular  we expect to significantly expand the marketing of our electronic commerce business solution and increase spending on advertising and marketing 
to implement this strategy  we plan to hire additional sales personnel  open new sales locations and hire additional staff for advertising  marketing and public relations 
we also plan to hire additional technical personnel and third parties to assist in the implementation and upgrade of eplussuite and to develop complementary electronic commerce business solutions 
as a result of these increases in expenses  we expect to incur significant losses in our eplussuite business that may  in the near term  have a material adverse effect on operating results for the company as a whole 
to the extent the company successfully implements this strategy  it expects the business to become less capital intensive over time 
as a result  management expects total assets and total liabilities to decrease 
the company expects to significantly reduce its receivables and lease assets along with the associated liabilities including debt and equipment payables 
the company has added new classifications to its financial statement presentation in order to reflect the changes in its business 
a line item  eplussuite revenues  has been added to the statement of earnings that includes the revenues associated with the e commerce business unit 
a new business segment  e commerce  has been added for segment reporting purposes to present separately e commerce business unit revenues 
on may   we acquired from procurenet  inc  the e commerce procurement software asset products and software technology for cleaning and categorizing product descriptions for e commerce catalogues 
these products and services and associated expenses with this business acquisition will substantially increase our expenses in the near term and the ability to sell these services and products is expected to fluctuate depending on the customer demand for these products and services  which to date is still unproven 
we also expect that the results of adding these offerings may cause management to redefine the internal business reporting process and impact the segment reporting in the first quarter of the next fiscal year which will end march  as a result of the foregoing  the company s historical results of operations and financial position may not be indicative of its future performance over time 
however  the company s results of operations and financial position will continue to primarily reflect its traditional sales and financing businesses for at least the next year 
selected accounting policies amounts charged for the e commerce business unit s procure service are recognized as services are rendered 
amounts charged for the manage service are recognized on a straight line basis over the period the services are to be provided 
the manner in which lease finance transactions are characterized and reported for accounting purposes has a major impact upon reported revenue and net earnings 
lease accounting methods significant to our business are discussed below 
we classify our lease transactions  as required by the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  or fasb no 
 as direct financing  sales type  or operating leases 
revenues and expenses between accounting periods for each lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification 
for financial statement purposes  we present revenue from all three classifications in lease revenues  and costs related to these leases in direct lease costs 
direct financing and sales type leases 
direct financing and sales type leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
a lease is a direct financing or sales type lease if the creditworthiness of the customer and the collectability of lease payments are reasonably certain and it meets one of the following criteria the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the customer by the end of the lease term  the lease contains a bargain purchase option  the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair market value of the leased equipment at the inception of the lease 
direct finance leases are recorded as investment in direct financing leases upon acceptance of the equipment by the customer 
at the inception of the lease  unearned lease income is recorded which represents the amount by which the gross lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the equipment exceeds the equipment cost 
unearned lease income is recognized  using the interest method  as lease revenue over the lease term 
sales type leases include a dealer profit or loss that is recorded by the lessor at the inception of the lease 
the dealer s profit or loss represents the difference  at the inception of the lease  between the fair value of the leased property and its cost or carrying amount 
the equipment subject to such leases may be obtained in the secondary marketplace  but most frequently is the result of re leasing our own portfolio 
this profit or loss that is recognized at lease inception  is included in net margin on sales type leases 
for equipment sold through our technology business unit subsidiaries  the dealer margin is presented in equipment sales revenue and cost of equipment sales 
interest earned on the present value of the lease payments and residual value is recognized over the lease term using the interest method and is included as part of our lease revenues 
operating leases 
all leases that do not meet the criteria to be classified as direct financing or sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
rental amounts are accrued on a straight line basis over the lease term and are recognized as lease revenue 
our cost of the leased equipment is recorded on the balance sheet as investment in operating lease equipment and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to our estimate of residual value 
revenue  depreciation expense and the resulting profit for operating leases are recorded on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
as a result of these three classifications of leases for accounting purposes  the revenues resulting from the mix of lease classifications during an accounting period will affect the profit margin percentage for such period and such profit margin percentage generally increases as revenues from direct financing and sales type leases increase 
should a lease be financed  the interest expense declines over the term of the financing as the principal is reduced 
residual values 
residual values represent our estimated value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
the residual values for direct financing and sales type leases are recorded in investment in direct financing and sales type leases  on a net present value basis 
the residual values for operating leases are included in the leased equipment s net book value and are recorded in investment in operating lease equipment 
the estimated residual values will vary  both in amount and as a percentage of the original equipment cost  and depend upon several factors  including the equipment type  manufacturer s discount  market conditions and the term of the lease 
we evaluate residual values on an ongoing basis and record any required changes in accordance with fasb no 
residual values are affected by equipment supply and demand and by new product announcements and price changes by manufacturers 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  residual value estimates are adjusted downward when such assets are impaired 
we seek to realize the estimated residual value at lease termination through renewal or extension of the original lease  sale of the equipment either to the lessee or the secondary market  or lease of the equipment to a new user 
the difference between the proceeds of a sale and the remaining estimated residual value is recorded as a gain or loss in lease revenues when title is transferred to the lessee  or  if the equipment is sold on the secondary market  in equipment sales revenues and cost of equipment sales when title is transferred to the buyer 
the proceeds from any subsequent lease are accounted for as lease revenues at the time such transaction is entered into 
initial direct costs 
initial direct costs related to the origination of direct financing  sales type or operating leases are capitalized and recorded as part of the net investment in direct financing leases  or net operating lease equipment  and are amortized over the lease term 
sales 
sales revenue includes the following types of transactions sales of new or used equipment which is not subject to any type of lease  sales of equipment subject to an existing lease  under which we are lessor  including any underlying financing related to the lease  and sales of off lease equipment to the secondary market 
other sources of revenue 
amounts charged for the electronic commerce business unit s procure service are recognized as services are rendered 
amounts charged for the manage service are recognized on a straight line basis over the period the services are provided 
these revenues are included in our eplussuite revenues in our consolidated statement of earnings 
fee and other income results from income from events that occur after the initial sale of a financial asset such as escrow prepayment income  re marketing fees  brokerage fees earned for the placement of financing transactions and interest and other miscellaneous income 
these revenues are included in fee and other income in our consolidated statements of earnings 
results of operations the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  total revenues generated by the company during the year ended march  were million compared to revenues of million for the year ended march   an increase of 
this increase is primarily attributable to increases in equipment sales and lease revenues 
the company s revenues are composed of sales  lease revenues  eplussuite revenues  and fee and other revenue  and may vary considerably from period to period 
sales revenue  which includes sales of equipment and sales of leased equipment  increased to million during the year ended march   as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of sales of equipment are generated through the company s technology business unit subsidiaries 
sales of used and or off lease equipment are also generated from the company s brokerage and re marketing activities 
for the year ended march   equipment sales through the company s technology business unit subsidiaries accounted for of sales of equipment 
for the year ended march   sales of equipment increased to million  a result of increased technology sales through the company s subsidiaries 
the acquisition of clg  inc in september  did not materially contribute to the increase in sales of equipment for the periods presented 
the company realized a gross margin on sales of equipment of for the year ended march   as compared to during the year ended march  this increase in net margin percentage can be attributed to improved vendor pricing negotiations and variations in the mix and volume of products sold 
the company also recognizes revenue from the sale of leased equipment 
during the year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year  sales of leased equipment decreased to million 
the revenue and gross margin recognized on sales of leased equipment can vary significantly depending on the nature and timing of the sale  as well as the timing of any debt funding recognized in accordance with sfas no 
the decrease in sales of leased equipment can be primarily attributed to the decline in the volume of leases sold to mlc clc  llc  a joint venture in which the company owns a interest 
during the years ended march  and  sales to mlc clc  llc  accounted for and of sales of leased equipment  respectively 
sales to the joint venture require the consent of the joint venture partner 
firstar equipment finance corporation  which owns of mlc clc  llc  discontinued their continued investment in new lease acquisitions effective may  the company has developed and will continue to develop relationships with additional lease equity investors and financial intermediaries to diversify its sources of equity financing

the company s ability to consummate such transactions  and the timing thereof  may depend largely upon factors outside the direct control of management 
the earnings from these types of transactions in a particular period may not be indicative of the earnings that can be expected in future periods 
for the year ended march   the company recorded million in eplussuite revenues  as compared to million in the year ended march  this represents an increase of 
these revenues consist of amounts charged for the arrangement of procurement transactions executed through procure  and manage  components of eplussuite 
the company s direct lease costs increased during the year ended march   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the largest component of direct lease costs is depreciation expense on operating lease equipment 
the acquisition of clg  inc  which had a higher percentage of operating leases  contributed to the increase  as did increases in the company s reserves for credit losses 
salaries and benefits expenses increased during the year ended march   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses increased over the prior fiscal year 
these increases reflect the increased number of personnel employed by the company  higher commission expenses in the technology business unit  and increased costs associated with the implementation of the company s strategies  as well as the acquisition of clg  inc interest and financing costs incurred by the company for the year ended march  increased  and relate to interest costs on the company s indebtedness 
in addition to increased borrowing under the company s lines of credit  the company s lease related non recourse debt portfolio increased significantly see liquidity and capital resources 
payment for interest costs on the majority of non recourse and certain recourse notes are typically remitted directly to the lender by the lessee 
the company s provision for income taxes decreased to million for the year ended march  from million for the prior fiscal year  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the foregoing resulted in a decrease in net earnings for the year ended march   as compared to the prior fiscal year

this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in equipment sales 
the increase in total revenues for the year ended march   without the inclusion of the operations of clg  inc  would have been 
sales revenue  which includes sales of equipment and sales of leased equipment  increased to million during the year ended march   as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
for the year ended march   equipment sales through the company s technology business unit subsidiaries accounted for of sales of equipment  with the remainder being sales from brokerage and re marketing activities 
sales of equipment increased significantly during the year ended march   primarily a result of increased technology sales through the company s subsidiaries 
for the year ended march   sales of equipment increased to million 
the acquisition of clg  inc in september   did not materially contribute to the increase in sales of equipment for the periods presented 
the company realized a gross margin on sales of equipment of for the year ended march   as compared to a gross margin of realized on sales of equipment generated during the year ended march  this decrease in net margin percentage can be primarily attributed to increased sales to larger volume customers who are more price competitive 
the company s gross margin on sales of equipment may be affected by the mix and volume of products sold 
during the year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year  sales of leased equipment decreased to million 
the decrease in sales of leased equipment can be primarily attributed to the decline in the volume of leases sold to mlc clc  llc 
during the years ended march  and  sales to mlc clc  llc  accounted for and of sales of leased equipment  respectively 
during the year ended march   the company recognized a gross margin of on leased equipment sales of million as compared to a gross margin of on leased equipment sales of million during the prior fiscal year

cash flows generated by financing activities amounted to million during the same period 
the net effect of these cash flows was a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year 
during the same period  our total assets decreased million  or  primarily the result of decreases in the company s net investment in direct financing and operating leases 
on april   a secondary offering of  shares of our common stock was completed that generated net proceeds of  the company s net investments in direct financing and operating lease equipment decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  during the period 
the cash balance at march  was million as compared to million the prior year 
working capital financing in our leasing business was  through december  when it expired  provided by a million committed credit facility which was a short term  secured  recourse facility provided through first union national bank  na and which had syndicated the facility to the following participants and in the following amounts national city bank million  summit bank million  bank leumi usa million  and key bank million 
this credit facility had been in place since december  was previously renewed for a one year period on december   had full recourse to the company  and was secured by a blanket lien against all of the company s assets

the facility expired on december  effective december   the company entered into a million day  committed  secured recourse facility through national city bank 
it had full recourse to the company  and was secured by a blanket lien against all of the company s assets 
in addition  the company entered into pledge agreements to pledge the common stock of all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants and certain restrictions on  among other things  the company s ability to make certain investments  and sell assets or merge with another company 
the interest rates charged under the facility are libor plus a margin ranging from to or prime plus a margin ranging from to 
the margin was determined by a matrix that was based on a ratio of the company s total recourse funded debt to ebitda earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization as determined under the facility 
subsequently  on january   the million national city credit facility was amended and increased to million and the term was lengthened to years 
the new facility expires on april  in addition  branch banking and trust company million and pnc bank  na million were added to the facility and national city was appointed agent 
the margin related to the libor interest rate option was increased from to to to 
as of march   the company had an outstanding balance of million on the national city credit facility 
the loss of this relationship could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we rely on this facility for daily working capital and liquidity for our leasing business 
in general  we use this facility to pay the cost of equipment to be put on lease  and we repay borrowings from the proceeds of long term  non recourse  fixed rate financing which we obtain from lenders after the underlying lease transaction is finalized or sales of leases to third parties 
as of march   the outstanding balance on this first union facility amounted to million  and represented of the outstanding recourse debt 
as of march   the outstanding balance on the national city facility amounted to million  and represented of the outstanding recourse debt 
the company has a million subordinated recourse note payable due to centura bank resulting from the acquisition of clg  inc this note comes due in october  and has an interest rate payable monthly 
eplus technology of nc  inc  eplus technology of pa  inc 
and eplus technology  inc 
have separate credit facilities to finance their working capital requirements for inventories and accounts receivable 
their traditional business as sellers of personal computers and related network equipment and software products is financed through agreements known as floor planning financing in which interest expense for the first thirty to forty days is not charged but is paid by the supplier distributor 
the floor planning liabilities are recorded as accounts payable trade  as they are normally repaid within the thirty to forty day time frame and represent an assigned accounts payable originally generated with the supplier distributor 
if the thirty to forty day obligation is not paid timely  interest is then assessed at stated contractual rates 
in addition to the floor planning financing  eplus technology  inc 
and eplus technology of nc  inc 
have accounts receivable facilities through deutsche financial services corporation 
of the total million dollar facility provided by deutsche financial services corporation  million is for traditional inventory floor planning and million is available for accounts receivable financing 
the maximum available under the accounts receivable facilities for eplus technology  inc 
and eplus technology of pa  inc 
are million and million respectively and as of march  the balance of these account receivable facilities  which is included in recourse notes payable  were  and respectively 
as of march  the respective floor planning inventory agreement maximum credit limits and actual outstanding balances are as follows balance at entity floor plan supplier credit limit march  eplus technology of nc  deutsche financial   inc

the floor planning facility provided by ibm credit corporation to eplus technology of pa  inc 
also requires a guaranty by eplus  inc 
for the total balance outstanding 
availability under the revolving lines of credit may be limited by the asset value of equipment purchased by the company and may be further limited by certain covenants and terms and conditions of the facilities 
eplus technology  inc 
was previously supplied a floor planning facility by bankamerica credit who terminated the agreement  effective august  eplus technology  inc 
contracted with deutsche financial services corporation on august   to replace the previous supplier 
both eplus technology of nc  inc 
and eplus technology of pa  inc 
agreements with finova capital corp 
were terminated on february  both eplus technology of pa  inc 
and eplus technology of nc  inc 
replaced these facilities under agreements with deutsche financial services corporation 
the loss of the deutsche financial services corporation relationship could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we rely on these facilities for daily working capital and liquidity for our technology sales business 
non recourse notes payable decreased to million at march  from million as of march  the decrease is primarily the result of loan paydowns on the debt portfolio through customer lease payments 
non recourse financings are loans whose repayment is the responsibility of a specific customer  although we may make representations and warranties to the lender regarding the specific contract or have ongoing loan servicing obligations 
under a non recourse loan  we borrow from a lender an amount based on the present value of the contractually committed lease payments under the lease at a fixed rate of interest  and the lender secures a lien on the financed assets 
when the lender is fully repaid from the lease payment  the lien is released and all further rental or sale proceeds are ours 
we are not liable for the repayment of non recourse loans unless we breach our representations and warranties in the loan agreements 
the lender assumes the credit risk of each lease  and their only recourse  upon a default under a lease by the lessee  is against the lessee and the specific equipment under lease 
we sell our leases to a number of financial institutions 
in particular  through mlc clc llc  we have a formal joint venture arrangement with an institutional investor  which purchases a substantial portion of our total equipment under lease 
firstar equipment finance  a subsidiary of firstar corporation  a bank holding company  is an unaffiliated investor that owns of mlc clc llc 
mlc clc llc represented approximately million of our total leased equipment sales of million or for the year ended march  it represented approximately million of our leased equipment sales of million or for the year ended march  firstar equipment finance corporation discontinued its investment in new lease acquisitions effective may as of march  amounts due to vendors for inventory and general expenses accounts payable trade and amounts due to vendors for equipment that will be placed on lease accounts payable equipment totaled million  as compared to million at march  as of march  and  the company had and million in notes receivable  respectively 
as of march   we had an outstanding note receivable of 
million from a corporation in which we also had warrants to acquire a major equity share 
subsequent to year end  the maker of the note was acquired and the note receivable was converted into cash from partial repayment  common stock and additional warrants of the acquiring entity 
adequacy of capital resources the continued implementation of the company s e commerce business strategy will require a significant investment in both cash and managerial focus 
in addition  the company may selectively acquire other companies that have attractive customer relationships and skilled sales forces 
the company may also acquire technology companies to expand and enhance the platform of eplussuite to provide additional functionality and value added services 
as a result  the company may require additional financing to fund its strategy implementation and potential future acquisitions  which may include additional debt and equity financing 
factors that may affect future operating results certain statements contained herein are not based on historical fact  but are forward looking statements that are based upon numerous assumptions about future conditions that may not occur 
actual events  transactions and results may materially differ from the anticipated events  transactions  or results described in such statements 
the company s ability to consummate such transactions and achieve such events or results is subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the matters set forth below 
the company s e commerce business has an extremely limited operating history 
although it has been in the business of financing and selling information technology equipment since  the company expects to derive a significant portion of its future revenues from its eplussuite services 
as a result  the company will encounter some of the challenges  risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies using new and unproven business models in new and rapidly evolving markets 
some of these challenges relate to the company s ability to o increase the total number of users of eplussuite services  o adapt to meet changes in its markets and competitive developments  and o continue to update its technology to enhance the features and functionality of its suite of products 
the company cannot be certain that its business strategy will be successful or that it will successfully address these and other challenges  risks and uncertainties 
over the longer term  the company expects to derive a significant portion of its revenues from eplussuite services  which is based on an unproven business model 
the company expects to incur increased expenses that may negatively impact profitability 
the company also expects to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses in connection with the development of this business 
as a result  the company may incur significant losses in its e commerce business unit in the foreseeable future  which may have a material adverse effect on the future operating results of the company as a whole 
the company began operating its eplussuite services in november  broad and timely acceptance of the eplussuite services  which is critical to the company s future success  is subject to a number of significant risks 
these risks include o operating resource management and procurement on the internet is a new market  o the system s ability to support large numbers of buyers and suppliers is unproven  o significant enhancement of the features and services of eplussuite services is needed to achieve widespread commercial initial and continued acceptance of the system  o the pricing model may not be acceptable to customers  o if the company is unable to develop and increase transaction volume on eplussuite  it is unlikely that it will ever achieve or maintain profitability in this business  o businesses that have made substantial up front payments for e commerce solutions may be reluctant to replace their current solution and adopt the company s solution  o the company s ability to adapt to a new market that is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product announcements and established competition  o significant expansion of internal resources is needed to support planned growth of the company s eplussuite services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a substantial portion of the company s liabilities are non recourse  fixed interest rate instruments  the company is reliant upon lines of credit and other financing facilities which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
these instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes  are denominated in us dollars  and  with the exception of amounts drawn under the national city bank and deutsche facilities  bear interest at a fixed rate 
because the interest rate on these instruments is fixed  changes in interest rates will not directly impact our cash flows 
borrowings under the national city and deutsche facilities bear interest at a market based variable rate  based on a rate selected by the company and determined at the time of borrowing 
if the amount borrowed is not paid at the end of the rate period  the rate is reset in accordance with the company s selection and changes in market rates 
due to the relatively short nature of the interest rate periods  we do not expect our operating results or cash flow to be materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of march   the aggregate fair value of our recourse borrowings approximated their carrying value
