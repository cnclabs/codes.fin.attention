sales increased from to because of the acquisition of diamond and the inclusion of the revenue of diamond products in the company s financial results of operations beginning on september  in addition  the company introduced products into new markets such as add in graphics cards and replaced older generation products in the desktop and laptop pc markets  resulting in an increased volume of product shipments and higher average selling prices 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period as new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their life cycles 
due to competitive price pressures  the company s products experience declining average selling prices over time  which at times can be substantial 
export sales accounted for  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
approximately of export sales in were to affiliates of united states customers 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurances that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
sales to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  were significant to net sales in one oem customer accounted for of net sales in two customers accounted for and of net sales in three customers accounted for  and of net sales in the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
gross margin the company had a negative gross margin of in  a positive gross margin of in and a negative gross margin of in the negative gross margin in was primarily the result of lower margin products sold by the rio and access divisions and a million charge for the write down of inventory relating to the shutdown of the diamond multimedia branded graphics add in board business 
another factor resulting in decreased gross margin was the highly competitive pricing pressures in the market for mainstream and entertainment graphics accelerators 
this was partially offset by improving margins on the company s desktop chips and communications products 
gross margin in as compared to gross margin in was favorably impacted by an increase in average selling prices and an increase in sales of products with higher margins primarily graphics chips  partially offset by charges for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market reserves made in the negative gross margin in was a result of decreases in overall average selling prices of the virge and trio family of accelerators 
also affecting the negative gross margin were charges for excess and obsolete inventory  lower of cost or market reserves established for the company s d and d products  a million charge for underutilized prepaid production capacity and yield losses 
in the future  the company s gross margins may be adversely affected by increased competition and related decreases in average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold and the extent to which the company incurs additional licensing fees

at december   the market value of both our short term and long term investment in umc had declined million below its original cost basis 
it was determined that this decline was related to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as a whole and was temporary in nature due to the historically cyclical nature of the industry 
the available for sale portion of our investment was marked to market through other comprehensive income as required by sfas subsequent to the year end  the market value of our investment in umc remained significantly below our cost 
the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general appears to be more severe than previously anticipated 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle 
the company is continuing to evaluate its need to reduce the value of its investment 
should the company conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary  it will report a loss in other income and expense at that time

in  the loss was principally due to the company s share of losses from rioport  inc in  the company recognized income of million  attributable to its investment in usc 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in to million in  primarily due to the company s increased borrowings on its bank facility 
other income expense  net other income expense  net changed from a net other income of million in to a net expense of million in this was the result of higher foreign currency translation losses in and lower interest income due to the decreasing balance of short term investments 
other income expense  net changed from net other expenses in of million to net other income in primarily due to non recurring write offs of certain equity investments and royalty expenses that occurred in and an increase in sublease income in as well as a decrease in interest income due to decreasing balances of short term investments 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate for was  compared to the benefit tax rates of and for and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for reflects the effects of the gain on the umc shares and the inability to use the goodwill amortization and foreign losses to reduce taxable income

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement  which was issued in june  and its amendments statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb no 
and  accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities issued in june and june  respectively collectively referred to as statement 
as a result of the adoption of statement  the company will recognize all derivative financial instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  in the consolidated financial instruments at fair value regardless of the purpose or the intent for holding the instrument 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in income or in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedging accounting  and if so  whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
generally  changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in income along with the portions of the changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk s

 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin became effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
factors that may affect results sonicblue has recently changed the focus of its business and may be unsuccessful or experience difficulties in implementing this change 
if this occurs  sonicblue may not be able to achieve operating profitability 
in january  sonicblue completed the transfer of its graphics chips business to s graphics co  ltd  a joint venture between via technologies  inc and a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue 
sonicblue is realigning its resources to focus on its digital media  consumer electronics  internet appliance and home networking businesses 
sonicblue has a limited operating history with these businesses  and its shift in focus may prove to be unsuccessful 
in addition  the industry is new and continually evolving 
sonicblue s digital media  consumer electronics  internet appliance and home networking businesses compete with larger  more established competitors  and sonicblue may be unable to achieve market success 
sonicblue s profitability depends on its ability to successfully implement its new business strategy 
sonicblue experienced net operating losses in the past and may experience net operating losses again in the future 
sonicblue had net income of million for the year ended december   primarily from recognizing a gain on the umc shares for the first time but not as a result of income from operations 
sonicblue had a net loss of million for  and sonicblue s sales during that time consisted of primarily older generation and lower price products that were sold into markets with significant price competition 
with the completion of the transfer of sonicblue s graphics chips business  sonicblue s ability to achieve operating profitability depends on its success in refocusing its business resources and in executing its business plan for its refocused business 
sonicblue cannot assure you that it will be able to achieve operating profitability 
if sonicblue is unable to achieve operating profitability or incurs future losses and negative cash flow  its stock price would likely decline 
sonicblue develops audio products for a new market  which may not develop if consumers do not accept digital audio as their preferred method of listening to music 
the market for digital audio products is new and evolving 
sonicblue s digital audio products play music that consumers download from the internet or cds 
the success of sonicblue s digital audio products depends in part on consumers using the internet  rather than using solely traditional sources  such as record stores where they buy cds or cassette tapes  as their preferred source of music 
if consumers do not access music on the internet  or from their cds  and download it for use on sonicblue s products  a market for sonicblue s products may not develop or may be limited 
a reduction in the availability or ease of downloading music from the internet will hurt the sales of sonicblue s products 
sonicblue s digital audio products play music downloaded from the internet and cds 
currently  litigation is pending that could decrease the availability of downloadable music available on the internet 
the five major record companies have sued napster 
com  an internet service that allows its users to swap songs 
the lawsuits maintain that the swapping of music between different users free of charge is a violation of the copyright laws in the united states 
if the record companies prevail in the litigation  and napster or companies offering similar services are forced to limit the selection of music available for download or are forced to go out of business  there would be a reduction in the amount of music available to consumers on the internet 
in march  the court issued an injunction that orders napster to police the trading of songs on its web site 
some web sites and record companies are working to provide fee based downloading of copyright protected music files 
if these web sites are unsuccessful in providing copyright protected music files or if consumers find the downloading too difficult or expensive  acceptance of the internet as a source of music would decline 
in addition  the rate at which the major record companies make their music available for digital purchases may discourage the use of digital audio players or reduce sonicblue s sales 
some record companies and internet companies have announced plans to create cds or digital music that cannot be copied or can only be copied a limited number of times  which would also limit the ability of users to download music from their own cd collections or share their music with others 
new copyright protection measures  such as these  increased fees associated with making multiple copies of music from personal collections  or changes in copyright laws  could diminish the ability of consumers to download music to rio players 
reductions in the availability or ease of downloading music from the internet  or limitations on copying from personal cds  could impair the use and sale of sonicblue s digital audio products 
sonicblue historically has had significant product concentration and currently depends on the health of the digital audio player market 
this means that a decline in demand for a single product  or in the digital audio player and consumer electronics market in general  could severely impact sonicblue s overall revenues and financial results 
sonicblue s revenues have historically been dependent on the markets for graphics video chips for pcs and on its ability to compete in those markets 
with the completion of the transfer of the graphics chips assets to a joint venture between via and a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue  sonicblue s remaining businesses continue to have significant product concentration 
sonicblue is dependent on the markets for digital audio players  modems  home networking and other consumer electronics products 
sonicblue s business would be materially harmed if it were unsuccessful in selling digital audio players  including its rio players 
historically  over of the net sales of sonicblue s subsidiary  diamond  have come from sales of graphics and video accelerator subsystems 
excluding the graphics chips businesses  the rio players have historically accounted for over of the remainder of diamond s sales 
in  rio players and products accounted for of sonicblue s net sales 
a decline in demand or average selling prices for digital audio players  modem and home networking products would have a material adverse effect on sonicblue s sales and operating results 
because sonicblue s largest financial asset is its shares of united microelectronics corporation  or umc  the volatility of sonicblue common stock may be influenced by the volatility of umc s stock price 
sonicblue s largest financial asset is its umc shares 
the market price of umc s stock is subject to volatility due to general market conditions as well as actual or anticipated changes in umc s business prospects or quarterly or yearly operating results 
the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general appears to be more severe than previously anticipated 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle 
because the umc shares are sonicblue s largest asset  when the price per share of umc s stock increases or declines  the price of sonicblue s common stock on the nasdaq national market tends to follow changes in umc s stock price 
fluctuations in the price of sonicblue common stock caused by changes in umc s stock price may or may not reflect sonicblue s actual or anticipated business prospects or quarterly results 
also  fluctuations in umc s stock price may cause fluctuations in sonicblue s stock price when there is no material news regarding sonicblue or any change in its results 
the information appliance market is new and evolving  and sonicblue s frontpath subsidiary may not succeed in developing and bringing to market information appliances for the home and vertical markets 
the market for information appliances is new and may not develop as sonicblue anticipates  if at all 
the potential size of this market opportunity and the timing of its development are uncertain 
broad acceptance of information appliances will depend on many factors  including the willingness of large numbers of consumers to use devices other than pcs to access the internet  and the development of content and applications that are accessible from information appliances 
a number of companies who have attempted to develop and enter the information appliance market have not succeeded in bringing products to market or have discontinued them or scaled back their information appliance divisions 
frontpath s new product  the progear  has been released in limited quantities but has not yet been produced or deployed in volume 
if frontpath is unable to obtain manufacturing capacity and develop efficiencies to successfully produce the progear in volume  it will be unable to supply information appliances in the vertical markets 
frontpath s development of products for the home depends upon its ability to successfully manufacture and deploy information appliances in volume 
if the market for information appliances does not develop or develops more slowly than sonicblue anticipates  or if sonicblue fails to meet the demand of that market or otherwise fails to achieve market penetration or price stability for its information appliance products  frontpath will experience losses that will harm sonicblue s operating results 
sales of digital media and connectivity products depend upon the widespread availability and adoption of broadband internet access 
sonicblue s home networking products and digital audio players  as well as future consumer oriented frontpath information appliances  rely or will rely on high speed access to the internet to provide compelling content 
since sonicblue does not have control over the reliability  availability and quality of broadband access and related services  it cannot guarantee that broadband access will be available to all consumers who wish to use information appliances 
factors that may impede market acceptance of broadband services and products that rely on high speed internet access include limited geographical service areas and lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  inconsistent quality and reliability of broadband service  lack of interoperability among multiple vendors network equipment  congestion in service providers networks  and inability to meet demands for increasing bandwidth 
these factors will likely affect sonicblue s ability to develop a market for and obtain market acceptance of its products  particularly its information appliances 
frontpath has invested  and is continuing to invest  substantial resources to develop its information appliances 
frontpath would be unable to generate significant revenues from sales of its information appliances  and will have expended significant resources on products for which it is generating limited or no revenues  if broadband access is not available and adopted on a widespread basis 
sonicblue s business is dependent on the internet and the development of the internet infrastructure 
the acceptance and sale of sonicblue s products could decrease if the infrastructure of the internet does not continue to be developed and maintained 
for example  if consumers do not have the necessary speed and data capacity for downloading music  rendering the internet too slow of a method for obtaining music  consumers may choose not to download music  which will decrease demand for sonicblue s digital audio products 
in addition  sonicblue s success will depend in large part on increased use of the internet which in turn can increase demand for high speed communications products and the products that benefit from high speed connections 
sonicblue s success will also depend on businesses and consumers using the internet more frequently for applications that use multimedia content and that require high bandwidth 
recent growth in internet use has caused frequent periods of performance degradation 
any perceived degradation in the performance of the internet as a whole could undermine the benefits of sonicblue s connectivity and digital media products  such as frontpath information appliances and rio digital audio players 
the performance of sonicblue s products depends on the speed and reliability of the internet infrastructure itself 
as a result  the emergence and growth of the market for sonicblue s products will depend on improvements being made to the entire internet infrastructure 
the joint venture with via will require sonicblue to pay specified liquidated damages if certain events occur  and earn out payments to sonicblue from the joint venture are subject to the joint venture meeting aggressive profitability goals 
the investment agreement with via provides that  upon occurrence of certain events  sonicblue will pay liquidated damages  subject to a maximum damages cap 
despite the cap  liquidated damages payments could harm sonicblue s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  sonicblue will receive earn out payments only if the new venture meets aggressive profitability goals specified in the joint venture agreement 
there can be no assurance that the joint venture will be able to meet these profitability goals 
sonicblue may not be able to successfully manage the growth and expansion of its business 
in the two past years  and particularly following its merger with diamond  sonicblue has experienced a significant expansion in the overall level of its business and the scope of its operations  including manufacturing  research and development  marketing  technical support  customer service  sales and logistics 
this expansion has resulted in significant challenges  and a need for substantial investment in  infrastructure  process development and information systems  including attracting  integrating and retaining key employees  integration of management information  product data management  internal control  accounting  telecommunications and networking systems  establishment of a significant worldwide web and e commerce presence  consolidation of geographically dispersed manufacturing and distribution facilities  coordination of suppliers  rationalization of distribution channels  establishment and documentation of business processes and procedures  and integration of various functions and groups of employees 
sonicblue may not successfully address these challenges 
sonicblue s future operating results will depend in large measure on its ability to implement operating  manufacturing and financial procedures and controls  improve communication and coordination among the different operating functions  integrate functions such as sales  procurement and operations  strengthen management information and telecommunications systems  and continue to hire additional qualified personnel in key areas 
sonicblue may be unable to manage these activities and implement these additional procedures  controls and systems successfully 
any failure to do so could cause sonicblue s short term and long term operating results to suffer 
sonicblue s quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors  any of which could result in sonicblue s failure to achieve its revenue or profitability expectations 
sonicblue s quarterly and annual results of operations have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond sonicblue s control 
any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause sonicblue to fail to achieve its revenue or profitability expectations 
the failure to meet market expectations would likely cause a decline in sonicblue s stock price 
these factors include sonicblue s ability to develop  introduce  produce in volume quantities and market successfully new or enhanced products  sonicblue s ability to introduce and market products in accordance with market demand and short design cycles  changes in the relative volume of sales of various products with sometimes significantly different margins  market acceptance of and changes in demand for sonicblue s products  rapid changes in electronic commerce on which sonicblue or its customers may not capitalize or which erode sonicblue s current business base  gains or losses of significant customers  distributors or strategic relationships  unpredictable volume and timing of customer orders  the availability  pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for sonicblue s products  including flash memory  substantial disruption in sonicblue s suppliers operations  either as a result of natural disaster  equipment failure or other cause  fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs  the timing of new technological advances  product announcements or introductions by sonicblue or by its competitors  product obsolescence and the management of product transitions and inventory  production delays  decreases in the average selling prices of products  rates of return in excess of those forecasted or expected  seasonal fluctuations in sales  general consumer electronics industry conditions  including changes in demand and associated effects on inventory and inventory practices  and general economic conditions  including economic conditions in asia and europe in particular  that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling 
some or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for sonicblue s products and its future operating results 
most of sonicblue s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
sonicblue may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall  which could harm its quarterly operating results 
because the lead times of firm orders are typically short in the consumer products industry  sonicblue does not have the ability to predict future operating results with any certainty 
because of the above factors  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance 
the demand for sonicblue s products has historically been weaker in certain quarters  which makes it difficult to compare our quarterly results 
due to industry seasonality  demand for digital audio and other consumer electronic products is strongest during the fourth quarter of each year and is generally slower in the period from march through august 
this seasonality may become more pronounced and material in the future to the extent that a greater proportion of sonicblue s sales consist of sales into the retail mass merchant channel  sonicblue s net revenues become increasingly based on entertainment related products  including products such as its rio digital music players  or to the extent sonicblue expands its european sales  it may experience relatively weak demand in the third calendar quarter due to historically weak summer sales in europe 
in addition  sonicblue generally ships more products in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with levels of shipment in the third month being higher towards the end of the month 
this pattern is likely to continue and makes future quarterly operating results less predictable 
because the consumer products market experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations  with more sales occurring toward the end of the year  sonicblue s quarterly results will be difficult to compare 
the markets in which sonicblue operates are intensely and increasingly competitive  and if it is unable to compete successfully  its revenues could decline 
the consumer digital media  consumer electronics  internet appliance and home networking markets in which sonicblue competes are intensely competitive and are likely to become more competitive in the future 
because of this competition  sonicblue faces a constant and increasing risk of losing customers to its competitors 
the competitive environment also creates downward pressure on prices and requires higher spending to address the competition  both of which tend to keep gross margins lower 
sonicblue believes that the principal competitive factors for its products are performance and quality  ability to conform and adapt to  or upgrade for  current and evolving industry standards  including audio formats  access to customers and distribution channels  reputation for quality and strength of brand  manufacturing capabilities and cost of manufacturing  price  product support  and ability to bring new products to the market in a timely manner 
many of sonicblue s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources 
some of these competitors may also have greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  greater market power and product breadth  lower cost structures and larger customer bases 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  some of sonicblue s principal competitors may have the advantage of producing their own component parts and therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
for example  intel makes flash memory  a key component in digital audio players  and has recently introduced a digital audio player 
in some markets where sonicblue is a relatively new entrant  such as modems  home networking  sound cards and consumer electronics  including digital audio or internet music players and internet appliances  it faces dominant competitors that include compaq internet appliances and digital audio players  com home networking and modems  creative technology under the name creative labs sound cards  modems and digital audio players  handspring personal digital assistants  or pdas  and digital audio player add ons to pdas  gateway home networking  home network digital audio players and internet appliances  intel home networking and digital audio players  motorola internet appliances and handheld consumer electronics  palm pdas  samsung digital audio players  digital audio player mobile telephones and internet appliances  sony consumer electronic music  digital audio players and a recently announced internet appliance and thompson multimedia digital audio players 
some of sonicblue s products face a variety of competitive sources 
for example  digital audio players compete against traditional stereos and cd players  and frontpath information appliances face competition from manufacturers of stand alone internet appliances  wireless portable internet appliances and manufacturers of pcs 
in addition  the markets in which sonicblue competes are expected to become increasingly competitive as pc products support increasingly more robust multimedia functions and companies that previously supplied products providing distinct functions for example  companies today primarily in the sound  modem  microprocessor or motherboard markets emerge as competitors across broader or more integrated product categories 
sonicblue operates in markets that are highly cyclical and vulnerable to sharp declines in demand and average selling prices 
sonicblue operates in the digital media and consumer electronics markets 
these markets have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  significant downturns 
in the event of a downturn  sonicblue would likely experience significantly reduced demand for its products and may be pressured to reduce average selling prices 
although sonicblue is changing its focus to concentrate on its internet related and digital media businesses  substantially all of its revenues during and were derived from products sold for use in or with personal computers 
in the near term  sonicblue expects to continue to derive most of its revenues from the sale of digital audio products  such as the rio players 
changes in demand in digital media and consumer electronics markets could be large and sudden 
since retailers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if market growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecasted product transitions 
in these cases  the retailers may abruptly stop purchasing additional inventory from suppliers like sonicblue until the excess inventory has been used 
this suspension of purchases or any reduction in demand for sonicblue s products would negatively impact its revenues and financial results 
sonicblue may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in results of operations due to these general industry conditions 
if sonicblue is unable to continue to develop and market new and enhanced products  its average selling prices and gross margins will likely decline 
sonicblue must continue to develop new products in order to maintain average selling prices and gross margins 
as the markets for its products develop and competition increases  sonicblue anticipates that product life cycles will shorten and average selling prices will decline 
in particular  average selling prices and  in some cases  gross margins  for each of its products will decline as products mature 
a decline in selling prices may cause the net sales in a quarter to be lower than those of a preceding quarter or corresponding quarter in a prior year  even if more units were sold during that quarter than in the preceding or corresponding quarter of a prior year 
to minimize the effect of declining average selling prices  sonicblue must successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new higher end and higher margin products to market in time to meet market demand 
the availability of new products is typically restricted in volume early in a product s life cycle 
if customers choose to wait for the new version of a product instead of purchasing the current version  sonicblue s ability to secure the manufacture of sufficient volumes of these new products to meet customer demand will be limited 
if this happens  sonicblue s revenues and operating margins could be harmed 
historically  the gross profit margins on the products of diamond multimedia were lower than the margins on sonicblue s products 
as a result of the diamond merger  sonicblue s average gross margins have been lower than they were prior to the diamond merger  thereby decreasing sonicblue s average gross margins 
in addition  because the products remaining in sonicblue s refocused business include diamond products such as the rio players  sonicblue s average gross margins will likely be lower after the transfer of the graphics chips assets to the joint venture between via and a wholly owned subsidiary of sonicblue than prior to the transfer 
if sonicblue fails to identify new product opportunities or develop and market new and enhanced products  it will not be able to compete successfully 
the markets for which sonicblue s products are designed are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and short product life cycles 
for example  the life cycles of the rio audio players typically range from to months 
if sonicblue fails to introduce new products successfully within a given time frame  sonicblue could lose revenues and market share 
further  continued failure to develop  introduce and market competitive new products that meet customer demands on time could also damage sonicblue s brand name  reputation and relationships with its customers and cause longer term harm to its financial condition 
sonicblue may not successfully enter the various product markets that it identifies 
in addition  the sale of new products may not become significant or profitable 
to succeed in this environment  sonicblue must anticipate the features and functionality that customers will demand 
sonicblue must then incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the design  performance  quality and pricing requirements of the digital media and consumer electronics markets in which it competes and the timing requirements of retail selling seasons 
sonicblue believes this will require expenditures for research and development in the future consistent with its historical research and development expenditures related to its current refocused businesses 
sonicblue has in the past experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and may experience similar delays in the future 
in the past  sonicblue s business was seriously harmed when it developed products that failed to achieve significant market acceptance and therefore was unable to compete successfully in its markets 
this type of failure could occur again in the future 
sonicblue must manage product transitions successfully in order to remain competitive 
the introduction of a new product or product line is a complex task  involving significant expenditures in research and development  training  promotion and channel development  and management of existing product inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns and slow moving channel inventory 
as new products are introduced  sonicblue attempts to monitor closely the inventory of products to be replaced  and to phase out their manufacture in a controlled manner 
there can be no assurance that product transitions will be executed without harming sonicblue s operating results 
failure to develop products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce sonicblue s revenues and harm sonicblue s competitive position 
sonicblue depends on a limited number of suppliers from whom it does not have a guarantee of adequate supplies  increasing the risk that a loss of or problems with a single supplier could result in impaired margins  reduced production volumes  strained customer relations and loss of business 
sonicblue obtains several of the components used in its products  including flash memory for its rio players and lcd screens and transmeta chips for its frontpath information appliances  from single or limited sources 
if component manufacturers do not allocate a sufficient supply of components to meet its needs or if current suppliers do not provide components of adequate quality or compatibility  sonicblue may have to obtain these components from distributors or on the spot market at a higher cost 
sonicblue rarely has guaranteed supply arrangements with its suppliers  and suppliers may not be able to meet its current or future component requirements 
if sonicblue is forced to use alternative suppliers of components  it may have to alter its product designs to accommodate these components 
alteration of product designs to use alternative components could cause significant delays and reduce its production of the related products 
in addition  from time to time sonicblue has experienced difficulty meeting certain product shipment dates to customers for various reasons 
these reasons include component delivery delays  component shortages and component quality deficiencies 
delays in the delivery of components  component shortages and supplier product quality deficiencies will likely continue to occur in the future 
these delays or problems have in the past and could in the future result in impaired margins  reduced production volumes  strained customer relations and loss of business 
for example  flash memory components  which are used in sonicblue s rio digital audio players  significantly increased in price in september due in part to supply interruptions arising from the earthquake in taiwan 
in addition  industry wide demand for flash memory components has increased dramatically  causing increases in price and shortages in supply 
these price increases and shortages may have an adverse impact on sonicblue s gross margin in future periods 
also  in an effort to avoid actual or perceived component shortages  sonicblue may purchase more of certain components than it may otherwise require 
excess inventory resulting from over purchases  obsolescence or a decline in the market value of such inventory could result in inventory write offs  which would have a negative effect on sonicblue s financial results as happened in the first and second quarters of although these over purchases related to the graphics chips business  they could occur with respect to other products 
similarly  prior to sonicblue s acquisition of diamond  diamond s perception of component shortages caused diamond to over purchase certain components and pay surcharges for components that subsequently declined in value in the second  third and fourth quarters of in addition  sonicblue s inventory sell offs or sell offs by its competitors could trigger channel price protection charges  further reducing its gross margins and profitability 
if a new storage medium becomes the industry standard for digital audio and sonicblue is unable to adapt its products  sonicblue may not be able to compete 
sonicblue s digital audio players currently include flash memory as their storage medium 
if the digital audio industry adopts a new storage medium as the industry standard instead of flash memory  sonicblue may not be able to adapt its products to be compatible with the storage medium 
further  even if sonicblue is able to adapt its products to a new industry standard storage medium  sonicblue may experience component shortages  particularly if that storage medium is based on technology that is proprietary in nature or produced by a limited number of suppliers 
if sonicblue is unable to predict market demand for its individual products  and focus its inventories and development efforts to meet market demand  it could lose sales opportunities and experience declines in revenues 
sonicblue offers a variety of products within each product line or division 
in order to arrange for the manufacture of sufficient quantities of products and avoid excess inventories  sonicblue needs to accurately predict market demand for each product 
for example  if sonicblue predicted that consumers would purchase the rio volt and plans its manufacturing accordingly  but instead consumer demand is for the rio  sonicblue would have excess inventory of the rio volt and lost sales opportunities for the rio  as well as lost market share and brand confidence 
sonicblue expects that it will become even more difficult to forecast demand as it introduces and supports multiple products and product lines and as competition in the market for its products intensifies 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause problems in sonicblue s operations 
sonicblue may not be able to accurately predict market demand in order to properly allocate its manufacturing and distribution resources among its products 
as a result  sonicblue may experience declines in its revenues and lose  or fail to gain  market share 
demand for sonicblue s digital audio products may decrease if the same capabilities provided by its products become available in or as add ons to other personal electronics products 
excluding sales of graphics chips products  a majority of sonicblue s net sales in were derived from the sale of digital audio players 
there is a trend within the personal electronics industry for functionality from individual products to be integrated with other personal electronics products 
for example  samsung  fuji  handspring and others have developed or announced plans to develop personal electronic products  such as mobile telephones  digital cameras or pda plug ins that integrate digital audio functions 
these products could significantly reduce the demand for sonicblue s products 
as a result of these trends of technology migration and product integration  sonicblue s success largely depends on its ability to continue to develop products that incorporate new and rapidly evolving technologies into its products 
sonicblue must continue to expand the scope of its research and development efforts to provide the latest in digital audio technology products  which will require that it hire and retain engineers skilled in these areas and promote additional coordination among its design and engineering groups 
alternatively  sonicblue may find it necessary or desirable to license or acquire technology to enable it to provide these functions 
this technology may not be available for license or purchase on terms acceptable to sonicblue  if at all 
sonicblue depends on third parties for the manufacture of its products 
sonicblue relies on independent subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and or test its products 
sonicblue procures its components  assembly and test services and assembled products through purchase orders  and it does not have specific volume purchase agreements with each of its subcontractors 
most of its subcontractors could cease supplying the services  products or components at any time with limited or no penalty 
if sonicblue needs to replace a key subcontractor  it could incur significant manufacturing set up costs and delays 
also  sonicblue may be unable to find suitable replacement subcontractors 
sonicblue s emphasis on maintaining low internal and channel inventory levels may exacerbate the effects of any shortage that may result from the use of sole source subcontractors during periods of tight supply or rapid order growth 
further  some of sonicblue s subcontractors are located outside the united states  which may present heightened process control  quality control  political  infrastructure  transportation  tariff  regulatory  legal  import  export  economic or supply chain management risks 
sonicblue faces competition for access to manufacturers and manufacturing capacity 
many of the companies competing with sonicblue for this capacity have longer operating histories and greater financial and market resources than sonicblue 
sonicblue may not be able to maintain access to adequate capacity of high quality manufacturing if its subcontractors choose to offer their services to other companies who can negotiate better terms due to their market presence  pay higher prices  engage more manufacturing capacity or offer other incentives 
as sonicblue develops new products  such as its frontpath information appliances  it will require manufacturing capacity to produce quantities to meet market demand 
if sonicblue is unable to obtain and maintain access to high quality manufacturing capacity for its existing and future products  it will not be able to fill distributor or customer orders  and its revenues will decline 
sonicblue s products could have defects or compatibility issues  which could be costly to correct and could result in the rejection of its products and damage to its reputation  as well as lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs and warranty claims 
sonicblue s products could have design defects that could cause them to malfunction 
product components may contain undetected errors or bugs when first supplied to sonicblue that  despite testing by sonicblue  are discovered only after sonicblue s products have been installed and used by customers 
from time to time  sonicblue has become aware of problems with components  product designs and other defects 
errors or defects in sonicblue s products may arise in the future  and  if significant or perceived to be significant  could result in rejection of sonicblue s products  product returns or recalls  damage to sonicblue s reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims 
errors or defects in sonicblue s products could also result in product liability claims 
sonicblue includes  or bundles  third party software  including operating systems  with its hardware products 
for example  sonicblue includes software with its rio players that the purchaser may use to download and store mp or wma files on the player 
sonicblue also incorporates third party software in its frontpath information appliances 
the software products and sonicblue s hardware products are complex and may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
sonicblue has distributed updates to rio players in the past when required to improve sound quality or to correct minor audio problems 
sonicblue generally provides warranties for its retail products allowing the return or repair of defective products 
despite testing by sonicblue  its suppliers or current or potential customers  errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these errors could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance or product acceptance or in warranty returns 
losses  delays or damage to sonicblue s reputation due to product defects would likely harm sonicblue s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  new versions or upgrades to operating systems  independent software vendor titles or applications may require upgrades to the software products sonicblue bundles with its hardware products  or the software products that purchasers of sonicblue s products may obtain from other sources such as the internet  to maintain compatibility with the new versions or upgrades 
the sources for the software sonicblue bundles  or the other sources for purchasers of sonicblue s products to obtain software  may not be successful in developing new versions  upgrades or enhancements to their software products 
if producers of software experience delays or are unable to maintain compatibility with new audio formats  operating systems and independent software vendor titles or applications  the demand for sonicblue s products and sonicblue s reputation could suffer 
loss of sales and damaged reputation could harm sonicblue s revenues and profitability 
sonicblue is subject to risks relating to product returns and price protection  which could limit sonicblue s revenues 
sonicblue often grants limited rights to customers and distributors to return unsold inventories of its products in exchange for new products  also known as stock rotation 
sonicblue also often grants price protection on unsold inventory  which allows customers to receive a price adjustment on existing inventory when its published price is reduced 
also  some of sonicblue s retail customers may accept returned products from their own retail customers 
these products are then returned to sonicblue for credit 
sonicblue has experienced a significant percentage returns of its rio players 
sonicblue estimates returns and potential price protection on unsold inventory in its distribution channel and accrues reserves for estimated returns  including warranty returns and price protection 
since the fourth quarter of  it reserves the gross margin associated with channel inventory levels that exceed four weeks of demand 
sonicblue may be faced with further significant price protection charges as its customers move to reduce channel inventory levels of current products  such as its rio  as new product introductions are made 
in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products  price declines and channel promotional expenses are more likely to occur and  should they occur  are more likely to have a significant impact on sonicblue s operating results 
further  in this environment  high channel inventory levels may result in substantial price protection charges 
these price protection charges have the effect of reducing net sales and gross margin 
consequently  in taking steps to bring its channel inventory levels down to a more desirable level  sonicblue may cause a shortfall in net sales during one or more accounting periods 
these efforts to reduce channel inventory might also result in price protection charges if prices are decreased to move product out to final consumers  having a further adverse impact on operating results 
any estimates  reserves or accruals may be insufficient and any future price reductions may seriously harm its operating results 
sonicblue depends on sales through distributors 
if relationships with or sales through distributors decline  its operating results will be harmed 
sonicblue sells its products through a network of domestic and international distributors  and directly to major retailers mass merchants 
sonicblue s future success is dependent on the continued viability and financial stability of its customer base 
retail channels historically have been characterized by rapid change  including periods of widespread financial difficulties and consolidation and the emergence of alternative sales channels  such as direct mail order  telephone sales and electronic commerce on the worldwide web 
sonicblue may be unable to retain its distributors 
also  its distributors may cancel or reschedule orders  and in the event of canceled orders  these orders may not be replaced by other sales 
in addition  sales to any particular distributor may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the loss of  or a reduction in  sales to any of sonicblue s key distribution customers as a result of changing market conditions  competition or customer credit problems could materially and adversely affect its operating results 
likewise  changes in distribution channel patterns  such as increased electronic commerce via the internet and increased use of mail order catalogues  could affect sonicblue in ways not yet known 
for example  the rapid emergence of internet based e commerce  in which products are sold directly to consumers at low prices  is putting substantial strain on some of sonicblue s traditional distribution channels 
inventory levels of sonicblue s products in the two tier distribution channels generally are maintained in a range of one to two months of customer demand 
these channel inventory levels tend toward the low end of the months of supply range when demand is stronger  sales are higher and products are in short supply 
conversely  during periods when demand is slower  sales are lower and products are abundant  channel inventory levels tend toward the high end of the months of supply range 
frequently  in these situations  sonicblue attempts to ensure that distributors devote a greater degree of their working capital  sales and logistics resources to sonicblue s products instead of to the products of sonicblue s competitors 
similarly  sonicblue s competitors attempt to ensure that their own products are receiving a disproportionately higher share of the distributors working capital and logistics resources 
sonicblue may experience significant decreases in revenues if its competitors are able to secure more resources than sonicblue is able to secure from distributors during periods of slower demand or if periods of slower demand result in price protection charges 
sonicblue s ability to market and distribute its products depends in part upon its current and future relationships with original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and other strategic partners to market and distribute sonicblue s products under their own brand names 
in addition to direct distributors of sonicblue s products  sonicblue also depends upon oems and other strategic partners to market and distribute its products 
for example  sonicblue has packaged for dell a digital audio receiver that streams digital audio from a home computer to the receiver  and through a strategic partnership with nike  sonicblue has developed a digital audio player that is designed for fitness enthusiasts 
if sonicblue is unable to obtain and maintain relationships with oems and strategic partners  it will not be able to increase sales of its products and achieve market acceptance as efficiently  and its revenues may decline 
sonicblue relies on intellectual property and other proprietary information that may not be adequately protected and that may be expensive to protect 
the markets in which sonicblue competes are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
sonicblue relies on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
if sonicblue is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property  its business may suffer from the piracy of its technology and the associated loss of sales 
also  the protection provided to sonicblue s proprietary technology by the laws of foreign jurisdictions  many of which offer less protection than the united states  may not be sufficient to protect its technology 
it is common in the personal electronics and internet device industries for companies to assert intellectual property infringement claims against other companies 
therefore  sonicblue s products may also become the target of infringement claims 
these infringement claims or any future claims could cause sonicblue to spend significant time and money to defend its products  redesign its products or develop or license a substitute technology 
sonicblue may be unsuccessful in acquiring or developing substitute technology and any required license may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  an adverse result in litigation could require sonicblue to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale  offer for sale and importation of infringing products  or discontinue the use of certain processes 
any of these events could materially harm sonicblue s business 
litigation by or against sonicblue could result in significant expense and could divert the efforts of its technical and management personnel  regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
however  even if claims do not have merit  sonicblue may be required to dedicate significant management time and expense to defending itself if it is directly sued  or assisting its customers in their defense of these or other infringement claims pursuant to indemnity agreements 
this could have a negative effect on sonicblue s financial results 
sonicblue may not be able to attract  retain or integrate key personnel  which may prevent it from succeeding 
sonicblue may not be able to retain its key personnel or attract other qualified personnel in the future 
sonicblue s success will depend upon the continued service of key management personnel 
the loss of services of any of the key members of sonicblue s management team or its failure to attract and retain other key personnel could disrupt operations and have a negative effect on employee productivity and morale  decreasing production and harming its financial results 
in addition  the competition to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical personnel  such as engineers  as well as qualified sales and operations personnel  is intense 
sonicblue has at times experienced  and continues to experience  difficulty recruiting qualified software and hardware development engineers 
sonicblue depends on a limited number of third party developers and publishers that develop software products that will operate with and fully utilize the capabilities of its rio players 
only a limited number of software developers are producing software that enables the download and use of digital audio players

at december   the market value of both our short term and long term investment in umc had declined to million 
a decline in the market value of the umc stock would reduce the market value of the number of shares we held at december  by approximately million 
it was determined that the decline from the carrying value at december  and the original cost basis was related to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as a whole and was temporary in nature due to the historically cyclical nature of the industry 
subsequent to the year end  the market value of the investment in umc remained significantly below cost 
the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general appears to be more severe than previously anticipated 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle 
should the company conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary  they will report a loss in other income and expense at that time
