management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of fragrances  cosmetics and personal care products 
innovation and creativity are combined to produce quality products for our customers around the world 
we operate in the fragrance and cosmetic industry  specializing in prestige perfumes and mass market perfumes and cosmetics o prestige products for each prestige brand  owned or licensed by us  we develop an original concept for the perfume consistent with world market trends 
o mass market products in our united states operations  we design  market and distribute inexpensive fragrances and personal care products  including alternative designer fragrances and mass market cosmetics 
compared to in fiscal year  we set a new sales record 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million in at comparable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales actually rose in as compared to our sales growth is attributable to across the board increases in both our prestige and mass market product lines 
however  the precipitous rise of the us dollar in relation to the french franc has masked our true revenue growth 
growth in net sales of prestige products  which was up approximately in  was fueled in part by the tremendous success of the recent launches of our paul smith and burberry touch fragrance lines 
paul smith premiered in the united kingdom in july and is presently being sold in over uk doors 
sales ran well ahead of expectations in the initial phase of the roll out 
burberry touch  our newest burberry fragrance  was launched worldwide in late september  and initial consumer reaction has been very favorable 
additional year launches included our st dupont signature line  which continues to perform strongly in the far east  and modern quartz by molyneux  which is very successful in france and south america 
in addition to expanding the geographic distribution of products we launched in  we have a large new product and brand extension pipeline in the works 
we are leveraging the popularity of burberry touch by bringing to market a new bath line for men and women  scheduled for introduction later this year 
in march  paul smith fragrances will be launched in japan where this designer has a large and loyal fashion following and over standing doors 
in february  we unveiled christian lacroix eau florale in the us with an exclusive at saks fifth avenue s stores  to be followed by european distribution later this spring 
development is going well with celine  our second lvmh license  and we are on target for the initial launch of two new celine fragrances in the fourth quarter of net sales of our mass market products were up for the year ended december   as compared to sales growth from our wide selection of mass market fragrances continues to exceed our expectations 
our new aziza line of cosmetics has also achieved widespread acceptance 
we expect sales to continue to grow as our high volume  discount store customers open more stores  and we continue to develop new products for them 
we are presently developing a line of health and beauty aids  including shampoos and conditioners 
growing sales within existing product lines  new product launches and an active new business development program are how we plan to continue to grow our business in the year and beyond 
during the year ended december  we signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with celine  a division of lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa our first line of celine fragrances is expected to debut in october also during fiscal  we signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with fubu the collection to produce and sell men s and women s fragrances 
we anticipate that the first fubu fragrance line for men and women will be launched either in the last quarter of  or in the first quarter of in addition  we are actively pursuing new business opportunities 
however  we cannot assure you that any new license or acquisitions will be consummated 
gross profit margins increased to of net sales for the year ended december   as compared to in gross profit margins have continued to increase over the past four years 
part of this improvement is the result of the strength of the us dollar in relation to the euro  as certain european sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  our prestige fragrance lines  which have been growing at a faster rate than our mass market lines  generate a higher gross profit margin than our mass market product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in and represented of sales in both and in the united states  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in  but declined to of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in our mass market sales do not require extensive advertising and therefore  more of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed rather than variable 
as a result  the increase in sales has enabled us to spread our fixed costs over a larger net sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by our french subsidiary  inter parfums  sa  increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of sales in  as compared to in promotion and advertising are prerequisites for sales of designer products 
we develop a complete marketing and promotional plan to support our growing portfolio of prestige fragrance brands and to build upon each brand s awareness 
as previously reported  inter parfums  sa  is a party to litigation with jean charles brosseau  sa brosseau  the licensor of the ombre rose trademark 
the licensor has claimed damages of approximately million and is seeking termination of the license agreement 
in october  inter parfums  sa received notice of a judgment in favor of brosseau  which awarded damages of approximately  and which directed inter parfums  sa to turn over its license to brosseau within six months 
inter parfums  sa is appealing the judgment as it vigorously and categorically denies the claims of brosseau 
the payment of the judgment has been stayed  and inter parfums  sa was allowed to continue to operate under the license agreement during the appeal process 
in june  the president of the court of appeal granted a petition filed by brosseau regarding ongoing payments for royalties due to brosseau 
in the same interlocutory judgment  the president of the court of appeal rejected inter parfums  sa s request for the appointment of a new judicial expert 
such request was made to refute the findings of the judicial expert originally appointed by the commercial court  which resulted in the  judgment against inter parfums  sa as a result of these further developments  inter parfums  sa and its special litigation counsel then considered it likely that the judgment would be sustained and therefore  inter parfums  sa recorded a charge against earnings in the second quarter of for   after taxes and minority interest  the full amount of the judgment 
in february  the court of appeal confirmed the brosseau claim with respect to turning over the license 
in addition  the court named an expert to proceed with additional investigations and required inter parfums  sa to pay  as an advance for damages claimed by brosseau 
inter parfums  sa will continue its appeal as it still denies the claims of brosseau 
we do not believe that such litigation will have any further material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
as of december   we have fully reserved the unamortized portion of the license agreement 
during the year ended december  we sold marketable securities and realized a gain of million  after taxes and minority interest 
on occasion  we invest excess cash in marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
these funds are available to support current operations or to take advantage of other investment opportunities 
at december   we had no remaining marketable security positions 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in we use the credit lines available to us  as needed  to finance our working capital needs 
we incurred a loss on foreign currency of million for both of our last two fiscal years 
occasionally  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   as compared to in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  includes a   after minority interest accrual to cover the potential exposure related to tax audits of inter parfums  sa commenced by the french tax authorities 
if not for these accruals  the declining tax rates in france would have caused a decline in our overall effective tax rate 
net income increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in net income for the year ended december  includes charges of  and a gain of  all after taxes and minority interest 
the charges represent an accrual for exposure relating to the brosseau litigation of  and a potential tax assessment of  the gain represents a realized gain on sale of marketable securities 
after giving effect to our for stock split effected in june  diluted earnings per share increased to for the year ended december   as compared to in weighted average shares outstanding aggregated million for the year ended december   as compared to million in on a diluted basis  average shares outstanding was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in shares repurchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program  offset shares issued upon exercise of stock options 
however  the increase in our stock price has increased the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options  thereby increasing diluted shares outstanding 
compared to net sales for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million in at comparable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales for the year ended december  were virtually unchanged from that of these results were in line with management s expectations as no new prestige fragrance launches were scheduled for and we entered the year during a downward trend in our mass market product lines  which resulted from the unsteady economic situation in eastern europe  brazil and other latin american countries 
in march  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the christian lacroix company  a division of lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa lvmh and a new christian lacroix product line was launched in october in addition  in the latter part of  the downward trend in our mass market product lines began to reverse 
as a result  at comparable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased for the three months ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
we are also actively pursuing new license agreements to build upon the strength of our existing portfolio 
gross profit margins increased to of net sales for the year ended december   as compared to in gross profit margins have continued to increase over the past three years 
part of the gross profit margin improvement is the result of the strength of the us dollar relative to the euro  as certain european sales are denominated in us dollars 
our prestige fragrance lines also generate a higher gross profit margin than our mass market product lines and these gross profit margin benefits have offset the negative affect of lower margin mass market product sales and closeout sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented of sales in both and in the united states  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in  and declined to of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in as a result of the weakness in domestic mass market product sales experienced in early  we instituted extraordinarily tight controls in an effort to keep spending in line with sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by our french subsidiary  inter parfums  sa  were million for the year ended december   as compared to million in some savings has been achieved in distribution and freight costs 
however  a reasonable level of advertising is necessary to support our growing portfolio of prestige fragrance brands and to build upon each brand s awareness 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in we use the credit lines available to us  as needed  to finance our working capital needs 
we incurred a loss on foreign currency of million for the year ended december   as compared to million in occasionally  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   as compared to in the effective tax rate for reflects the positive effects of the tax benefit to be realized upon the closing of our brazilian subsidiary 
net income increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in earnings per diluted share increased to for the year ended december   as compared to in weighted average shares outstanding aggregated million for the year ended december   as compared to million in on a diluted basis  average shares outstanding was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the declines are the result of our common stock repurchase program 
liquidity and financed resources our financial position remains very strong as a result of continued profitable operating results 
at december   working capital aggregated million and we had a working capital ratio of almost to cash and marketable securities on hand aggregated million and our net book value was per outstanding share as of december  furthermore  we had only million in long term debt 
on occasion we use a portion of our cash to make investments in marketable equity securities classified as available for sale 
these funds are available to support current operations or to take advantage of other investment opportunities 
these investments are made to maximize our return on cash 
as of december  we had no marketable security positions 
during the year ended december   we continued our stock repurchase program by acquiring  of our common shares at an average cost of per share 
we believe that our stock price does not reflect our growth rate  prospects for future growth  the value of our licenses and our worldwide distribution network 
in addition  the market capitalization of our ownership interest in inter parfums  sa  our publicly traded paris subsidiary  is in excess of million  which is significantly higher than that of the company as a whole 
our short term financing requirements are expected to be met by available cash at december   cash generated by operations and short term credit lines provided by domestic and foreign banks 
the principal credit facilities for are a million unsecured revolving line of credit provided by a domestic commercial bank and approximately million in credit lines provided by a consortium of international financial institutions 
during the year ended december  we generated million in cash from operating activities  as compared to million in at december  accounts receivable increased  as compared to december   which is in line with our increase in net sales 
in addition  inventories rose as a result of a planned buildup to support all of the recent new product launches and to prepare for anticipated revenue growth 
we believe that funds generated from operations  supplemented by our present cash position and available credit facilities  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet all present and reasonably foreseeable future operating needs 
in january  certain member countries of the european union established permanent fixed rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency  the euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is scheduled to be completed by january  however  we do not expect the introduction of the euro and the phasing out of other currencies to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation rates in the us and foreign countries in which we operate did not have a significant impact on operating results for the year ended december  forward looking statements statements in this document  which are not historical in nature  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from projected results 
given these risks  uncertainties and other factors  persons are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
such factors include effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts and product acceptance by consumers  dependence upon management  competition  currency fluctuation and international tariff and trade barriers  governmental regulation and possible liability for improper comparative advertising or trade dress 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that primarily consists of the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we have entered into one interest rate swap in an attempt to take advantage of low variable interest rates as compared to the fixed rate on our long term debt 
we do not engage in the trading of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or interest rate swaps 
foreign exchange risk management we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge receivables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the receivables and cash flows of inter parfums  sa  our french subsidiary  whose functional currency is french francs 
all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions  which are rated as strong investment grade 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of these exposures are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
we believe that our risk of loss as the result of nonperformance by any of such financial institutions is remote and in any event would not be material 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding one year 
costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our financial results 
at december   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of approximately million 
the foreign currencies included in these contracts are principally the us dollar and the british pound 
interest rate risk management we mitigate interest rate risk by continually monitoring interest rates  and then determining whether fixed interest rates should be swapped for floating rate debt  or if floating rate debt should be swapped for fixed rate debt 
we have entered into one interest rate swap to take advantage of declining interest rates 
at december  we had one interest rate swap agreement outstanding to convert million of principal fixed rate debt with an interest rate of to floating interest rate debt  at the euibor rate  over the life of our long term debt due in at december   the euibor rate was 
if interest rates were to rise per annum over the remaining term of the long term debt  then we would incur a loss of
