liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
additionally  we pursue an active acquisition strategy  and capital needs are created as acquisition opportunities are pursued 
historically  our primary sources of financing have been net cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  and proceeds from the sale of equity or subordinated notes 
at september  and  our working capital was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september  this was a result of million in net income  depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in deferred rent of million 
this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  as well as minor changes in other operating accounts

approximately million was used to fund acquisitions  and million was used to open fourteen new stores  relocate remodel eight stores and construct a new corporate office

there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures other than new store openings and remodeling or relocating existing stores in the next months 
at september   we had outstanding million under our credit facility 
the credit facility currently has a maximum availability of million and a maturity date of july   and is secured by our inventory and certain other of our assets 
we believe that cash expected to be generated from operations  and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of acquisitions  for the next months 
we may need to seek additional debt and or equity financing in order to fund any future acquisitions 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  we cannot predict accurately the effect of inflation on future operating results 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our total revenue and net income for the year during the first and fourth fiscal quarters  with a majority of net income for such quarters realized in the first fiscal quarter 
due to the importance of the holiday shopping season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new store openings and acquisitions and unexpected changes in volume related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies from manufacturers 
in addition  operating results may be negatively affected by increases in merchandise costs  price changes in response to competitive factors and unfavorable local  regional or national economic developments that result in reduced consumer spending
