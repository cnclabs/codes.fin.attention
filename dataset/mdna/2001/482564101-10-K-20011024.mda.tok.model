item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations the following table sets forth the company s net sales and certain other financial data for the three fiscal years ended july  years ended july  net sales    gross profit    gross profit as percent of net sales selling  general and administrative expense    operating income    other income expense  net    income before taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    sales revenue vs net sales revenue in fiscal was greater than in fiscal although sales revenue from the company s wood treating chemicals was down significantly in fiscal  that decline was offset by the company s sales of msma products  which began during the second quarter of fiscal management believes that wood treating chemical sales declined in fiscal because commercial demand for railroad crossties and utility poles was below historical levels during the year 
crosstie replacement projects appear to have been deferred by major railroads 
deregulation and mergers in the utility industry led to inventory consolidations that reduced overall demand for replacement utility poles 
additionally  some utilities shifted to purchases of poles treated with a competing product  cca 
because the company s penta product is dissolved in oil to create a treating solution  higher diesel oil prices since fiscal have meant that treating solutions made using cca enjoyed a widened price differential over the company s product compared to historical levels 
gross profit for fiscal was down from the prior fiscal year and the company s gross profit margin declined to from 
the decrease in gross profit and margin was attributable to the decline in higher margin penta sales 
vs net sales revenue for fiscal was less than in fiscal  a decline caused by reduced sales volume for the company s wood treating products 
penta product volume fell because utility company consolidations in north america reduced demand for utility poles  the principal wood product treated with penta  and because diesel oil prices were at historically high levels 
an additional factor  however  was that the company s penta based sapstain product was not renewed for use in its two largest markets  chile and malaysia 
creosote sales were adversely affected by a deferral of railroad crosstie replacement by major railroads 
gross profit for fiscal increased over fiscal and gross profit margin increased from to 
higher per unit wood treating chemicals sales revenues coupled with lower per unit manufacturing costs of penta products helped maintain gross profit in the face of declining net sales revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were thousand higher than fiscal and fiscal was higher than fiscal most of the increase in fiscal was for expenses related to the msma products line purchased in october the company also incurred severance costs in the most recent fiscal year for a force reduction at the company s manufacturing facility in mexico
