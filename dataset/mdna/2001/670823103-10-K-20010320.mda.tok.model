item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general as of december   we operated o charley s restaurants in alabama  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  ohio  south carolina  tennessee and virginia and two stoney river restaurants in suburban atlanta 
o charley s are casual dining restaurants that are intended to appeal to mainstream casual dining customers as well as upscale casual dining and value oriented customers by offering high quality  freshly prepared food at moderate prices with friendly and attentive customer service 
our growth strategy for the o charley s concept is to continue penetrating existing and new targeted major metropolitan areas while opening new units in smaller secondary markets in close proximity to our metropolitan markets 
stoney river restaurants are upscale steakhouses that are intended to appeal to both upscale casual dining and fine dining customers by offering hand cut  premium midwestern beef along with fresh seafood and other gourmet entrees with attentive service in a warm  friendly and relaxed environment 
our growth strategy for stoney river is to concentrate on major metropolitan markets in the southeast and midwest with disciplined  controlled development and the potential to accelerate development over the next several years 
we operate a commissary for the primary purpose of providing our restaurants with consistent quality food products that meet our specifications while obtaining lower prices for those items through volume purchasing 
a substantial majority of the food products served in our restaurants are distributed to the restaurants by the commissary 
in addition to purchasing food and other non food products  the commissary manufactures certain proprietary products and ages and cuts red meat into steaks in its usda approved and inspected facility 
we believe our commissary gives us a competitive advantage in servicing our restaurants and a financial advantage 
we attribute the decreases in food cost as a percentage of our restaurant sales over the past three years  in part  to the financial leverage generated from the increased purchasing volumes and operating efficiencies of our commissary 
the commissary s profits are consolidated into the cost of food  beverage and supplies line item in our financial statements 
the following table reflects changes in the number of o charley s restaurants we operated during the periods presented o charley s restaurants in operation  beginning of period restaurants opened restaurant acquired from franchisee in operation  end of period on may   we purchased two existing stoney river restaurants and all associated trademarks and intellectual property for approximately million in a cash transaction accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  the results of operations of the two stoney river restaurants have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition 
the transaction includes an earn out provision pursuant to which we may be required to pay the former owners up to million at the end of  million at the end of  and million at the end of the potential earn out is based on the stoney river legendary steaks concept achieving certain performance thresholds income before taxes and preopening costs for the year in question 
our interest expense increased as a result of the indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition 
our depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the million of goodwill associated with the acquisition that is being amortized over years and will increase to the extent we are required to make payments to the former owners pursuant to the earn out provision 
we are conducting a feasibility study on franchising our o charley s restaurant concept and expect to have the preliminary results of that study later in should we decide to establish franchising operations  there could be a negative effect on our results of operations 
see risk factors we may experience higher operating costs  which would adversely affect our operating results if we cannot increase menu prices to cover them 
revenues consist of restaurant sales and to a lesser extent commissary sales 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes 
commissary sales represent sales to outside parties consisting primarily of sales of o charley s branded food items  primarily salad dressings  to retail grocery chains  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
cost of food  beverage and supplies primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
we believe our menu offers a broad selection of menu items and as a result there is not a high concentration of our food costs in any one product category 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather  cause periodic fluctuations in food and other costs 
generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to customers  however  we have in the past generally adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries and bonuses  hourly wages for restaurant level employees  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have an incentive bonus plan that compensates restaurant management for achieving and exceeding certain restaurant level financial targets and performance goals 
we typically pay our employees more than minimum wage and do not expect an immediate adverse effect on our financial performance from any further increase in the federal minimum wage rate 
however  as in prior years  we do expect that overall wage inflation will be higher for several years following any minimum wage increase 
as congress has raised the federal minimum wage rate in recent years  the base wage rate for our tipped employees has remained at 
any increase to the base wage rate for our tipped employees would increase payroll costs 
restaurant operating costs include occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses and expenses  management training salaries  general liability and property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 
utility costs began to significantly increase in december we anticipate continued utility rate increases in  which would increase our restaurant operating costs 
in october  we entered into agreements providing for a five year synthetic lease facility pursuant to which the lessor has agreed to acquire and finance construction of up to million of properties and lease the properties to us 
we are also evaluating a possible sale and leaseback facility pursuant to which the lessor would acquire certain of our restaurant properties and then lease those properties to us 
to the extent that proceeds from any sale and leaseback transaction are used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  this would reduce our interest expense 
we would incur additional rent expense  however  which would increase our restaurant operating costs and decrease our restaurant operating income 
restaurant operating income is defined as restaurant sales less cost of restaurant sales 
cost of restaurant sales  for purposes of this discussion  consists of cost of food  beverage and supplies  payroll and benefits and restaurant operating costs 
advertising  general and administrative expenses include all advertising and home office administrative functions that support the existing restaurant base and provide the infrastructure for future growth 
advertising  executive management and support staff salaries  bonuses and related expenses  data processing  legal and accounting expenses and office expenses account for the major expenses in this category 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life and  prior to  included amortization of preopening costs for new restaurants  which included costs of hiring and training the initial staff and certain other costs 
depreciation and amortization also includes amortization of goodwill  which relates primarily to the acquisition of the stoney river concept 
our depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the million of goodwill incurred in connection with our may acquisition of the stoney river legendary steaks concept 
depreciation and amortization for goodwill associated with the acquisition will increase to the extent we are required to make payments pursuant to the earn out provision discussed above 
preopening costs include operating costs and expenses incurred prior to a new restaurant opening 
in the first quarter of  we began expensing preopening costs in the period incurred in accordance with sop prior to the adoption of sop  preopening costs were capitalized and amortized over one year 
our current practice of expensing preopening costs may cause fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on when those costs are incurred 
see risk factors fluctuations in our operating results and other factors may result in decreases in our stock price 
we recognized a charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy in the first quarter of starting in  we began reflecting our preopening costs on a separate line item labeled preopening costs on the statement of earnings rather than reporting these costs in the depreciation and amortization line item 
the amount of preopening costs incurred in any one year includes costs incurred during the year for restaurants opened and under development 
we incurred average preopening costs of approximately  for each new o charley s restaurant opened during we anticipate higher preopening costs for each stoney river restaurant we open as compared to the average preopening costs for an o charley s restaurant

cost of food  beverage and supplies in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food  beverage and supplies decreased to in from in we attribute these lower food cost percentages primarily to three factors a menu price increase in march  which increased the average check  a decrease in the cost of several food items  and improved purchasing and operating efficiencies in our restaurants and commissary 
these improvements were partially offset by the inclusion of the stoney river restaurants which we acquired in may and which have a higher cost of food  beverage and supplies as a percentage of sales  and an increase in poultry  red meat and baby back rib costs 
we anticipate increases in red meat costs in there can be no assurance that events outside our control will not result in increased costs in other food and other items 
payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in from in the increase was attributable to increasing wage rates and salaries for restaurant support staff and management along with higher workers compensation and health insurance costs in those higher wages and salaries were partially offset by economies achieved from higher average restaurant sales volumes and reduced turnover rates for our hourly employees

the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in included preopening cost amortization of million 
since the beginning of  preopening costs have been recorded in a separate line item and the depreciation and amortization line  beginning in  no longer includes any preopening cost amortization

quarterly financial and restaurant operating data the following is a summary of certain unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the last three fiscal years 
for accounting purposes  the first quarter consists of weeks and the second  third and fourth quarters each consist of weeks weeks in the fourth quarter of because it was a week year 
as a result  some of the variations reflected in the following table may be attributed to the different lengths of the fiscal quarters 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter dollars in thousands  except per share data revenues     income from operations     net earnings     basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share restaurants in operation  end of quarter revenues     income from operations     earnings before cumulative change in accounting principle 
    net earnings     basic earnings per common share earnings before change in accounting principle net earnings diluted earnings per common share earnings before change in accounting principle net earnings restaurants in operation  end of quarter revenues     income from operations     net earnings     basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share restaurants in operation  end of quarter there is a small degree of seasonality to our business  with average weekly sales being slightly lower in the winter months 
however  because our first fiscal quarter consists of weeks  the effect of such seasonality is not necessarily reflected in the quarterly financial results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capitalized lease obligations 
our principal capital needs arise primarily from the purchase and development of new restaurants  equipment replacement and improvements to existing restaurants 
cash provided by operations was million in  compared to million in and million in our working capital has historically reflected current liabilities in excess of current assets due to cash reinvestments in long term assets  mostly property and equipment additions 
at december   the working capital deficiency was million and the current ratio  which we define as current assets divided by current liabilities  was to the total net decrease in cash was  in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility in were million which increased the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility from million at year end to million at year end the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the facility during was 
our revolving credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing capacity of million  however  the maximum borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility is reduced by amounts financed under our synthetic lease facility described below 
our revolving credit facility matures on may  our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us with respect to the maintenance of certain financial ratios  the incurrence of indebtedness  sale of assets  mergers and the payment of dividends 
on october   we entered into agreements providing for a five year synthetic lease facility pursuant to which the lessor has agreed to acquire or construct up to million of properties and lease the properties to us 
the terms of the facility provide for a separate operating lease agreement to be entered into for each property upon completion of acquisition or construction  each with a lease term ending october  monthly rental payments for each property lease are based on the total costs advanced by the lessor to acquire or construct such property  and the amount of those payments varies based upon the floating interest rate in effect from time to time under our revolving credit facility 
at december   the monthly lease payment for these properties was based on an interest rate of  and the lessor s total accumulated cost of properties acquired under the facility was approximately million 
the lease facility requires us to meet certain financial and other covenants similar to the covenants and restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility 
the acquisition and construction costs paid by the lessor under the synthetic lease facility reduce the maximum borrowing capacity under our million revolving credit facility as described above 
upon the expiration of the synthetic lease facility  we may seek to renew the facility 
any renewal of the facility requires the lessor s consent 
if we are unable to or choose not to renew the facility  we have the option to sell the properties to third parties on behalf of the lessor  surrender the properties to the lessor or purchase the properties at their original cost 
if we sell the properties to third parties for less than their aggregate original cost  we are obligated  under a residual value guarantee  to pay the lessor an amount equal to any shortfall  not to exceed of the aggregate original cost of the properties 
to the extent the aggregate sales proceeds exceed the aggregate original cost of the properties  the lessor is required to remit any excess to us 
if we surrender the properties to the lessor  we are obligated  under our residual value guarantee  to pay the lessor an amount equal to of the aggregate original cost of such properties 
if the lessor later sells such properties to third parties  the lessor must remit the sales proceeds to us to the extent the sale proceeds  plus the amount of our residual value guarantee payment  exceeds the aggregate original cost of the properties 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the facility or sell the properties to third parties  and we will require substantial additional financing if we purchase these properties or surrender the properties to the lessor upon the expiration of the synthetic lease facility 
we believe that the anticipated fair value of the properties currently leased under this facility could eliminate or substantially reduce our exposure under the residual value guarantee with respect to those properties 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to make substantial payments to satisfy this guarantee or the guarantee on any other properties that may be constructed or purchased by the lessor in the future under this facility 
in  we repaid million in principal on our capitalized lease obligations 
additionally  we financed million in restaurant equipment through new capitalized lease obligations 
on september   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   approximately  shares  or of our outstanding stock  had been repurchased 
approximately  shares were repurchased in on may   we purchased two existing stoney river legendary steaks restaurants and all associated trademarks and intellectual property for approximately million in cash 
the transaction includes an earn out provision pursuant to which we may be required to pay the former owners up to million at the end of  million at the end of  and million at the end of the potential earn out is based on the stoney river legendary steaks concept achieving certain performance thresholds income before taxes and preopening costs for such year 
property and equipment expenditures  excluding the acquisition cost for the two existing stoney river restaurants  were million in  including million of equipment acquired under capital leases 
these expenditures were made primarily for new o charley s restaurants opened during the year  restaurants under construction at december   the expansion of our commissary facilities and improvements to existing restaurants 
we have budgeted approximately million to million in for capital expenditures for the planned to new o charley s restaurants  improvements to existing o charley s restaurants  expansion of the stoney river legendary steaks concept  including the two stoney river restaurants under development and expansion of our commissary facilities 
from january  through february   we had incurred approximately million in capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures in will not vary significantly from budgeted amounts based upon a number of factors  including the timing of additional purchases of restaurant sites 
we expect to finance these capital expenditures with operating cash flows  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capitalized lease obligations 
we intend to continue financing the furniture  fixtures and equipment for our new restaurants primarily with capitalized lease obligations and to finance the acquisition and construction of certain properties with our synthetic lease facility 
we are currently evaluating a possible sale and leaseback facility pursuant to which we would sell some of the restaurant properties at which we currently own the land and building and then lease those properties from the buyer 
we currently anticipate that proceeds from the sale would be used primarily to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
we cannot assure you that we will enter into a sale and leaseback facility or  if we do so  the number of restaurant properties that we may sell or the terms of the leases pursuant to which we lease properties from the buyer 
we believe that available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  capitalized lease obligations and our synthetic lease facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital outlays for at least the next months 
our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions or strategic joint ventures 
any acquisitions  joint ventures or other growth opportunities may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from a public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to us 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land and construction costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
utility costs began to significantly increase in december  although these increases had only a minimal effect on our results of operations in we anticipate continued utility rate increases in  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
this interpretation provides guidance for issues that have arisen in applying apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
our existing accounting policies conformed to the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 therefore  adoption of this interpretation did not impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenues in financial statements 
we adopted sab no 
 as amended by the sec  in the fourth quarter of our existing accounting policies conformed to the requirements of sab  therefore  adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was later amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires recognition of the fair value of all derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  on the balance sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging activities 
we were required to adopt sfas no 
 as amended  on january  and the adoption did not impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we currently utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized leases and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our revolving credit facility 
in addition  lease payments under our synthetic lease facility are and will continue to be at variable rates based upon prevailing interest rates 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our revolving credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving credit facility 
at december   we did not have any swaps in place 
we currently have in effect million in swaps at an average fixed rate of  million of which mature in december  million of which mature in january and million of which mature in january
