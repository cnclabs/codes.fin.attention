acquisitions one of our business strategies is to acquire companies to obtain key technologies that will enable us to expand our product portfolio 
we continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
in the past three years  we have completed the following acquisitions consideration paid number of shares of pmc accounting cash common stock method acquired company location date acquired in s and options applied technology acquired integrated telecom gaithersburg  md may   purchase sars  traffic management technology  inc and switch fabrics abrizio  inc mountainview  ca september  pooling high capacity protocol agnostic switch fabrics toucan technology ltd

for acquisitions that were accounted for as a pooling of interests  we restated all historical financial information to reflect the results of operations of the acquired businesses 
for more information  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenues  change change networking products non networking products total net revenues net revenues were million in  million in and million in  which equates to growth in and growth in our networking revenue increased in and in due to increased customer demand that was relatively evenly spread across most of our networking products 
our volume grew due to the growth of our customers networking equipment businesses  our customers continued transition from internally developed application specific semiconductors to our standard semiconductors  and our introduction and sale of our products that address additional network functions 
during december and into the first quarter of  many of our customers experienced decreased demand  order cancellations or postponements and had accumulated significant inventories of our networking products 
see outlook for our non networking revenue grew in and declined in as a result of our customers fluctuating ordering patterns 
we expect non networking revenues to decline to zero in as our principal customer intends to redesign the product into which our products are incorporated 
gross profit  change change networking products percentage of networking revenues non networking products percentage of non networking revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit was million in  million in and million in this represented growth of in and in total gross profit grew in compared to due to increased demand for both networking and non networking products 
in  total gross profit increased compared to as networking product revenue growth exceeded the decline in non networking product revenue 
total gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased in and as our higher gross margin networking revenues comprised a greater portion of our total revenues 
because we sell highly complex networking products in lower volumes  we charge higher prices and generate higher gross margins relative to the overall semiconductor industry 
we believe that if the market for our networking products grows  we introduce products that typically sell in higher volumes or our customers purchase our products in greater quantities  we will experience pricing pressure and our gross profit as a percentage of revenue will decline 
the gross margins of each of our networking products vary significantly 
our gross margins may decline in the future as a result of a shift in revenue mix to lower margin products 
non networking gross profit as a percentage of non networking revenue declined in and due to our reduction of selling prices on these products as they mature 
other costs and expenses  change change research and development percentage of net revenues marketing  general administrative percentage of net revenues amortization of deferred stock compensation research and development marketing  general administrative percentage of net revenues amortization of goodwill  percentage of net revenues costs of merger percentage of net revenues in process research development percentage of net revenues impairment of intangible assets percentage of net revenues research and development expenses and marketing  general and administrative expenses our research and development  or r d  expenses were million in  million in and million in  an increase of in and in the increase in r d expenses reflects our ongoing r d efforts relating to networking products 
r d expenditures increased in and due to an increase in personnel costs as a result of acquisitions and internal hiring of r d personnel  and increased service and material costs associated with our expanding product development efforts 
r d decreased as a percentage of net revenues primarily because net revenues increased at a faster rate than r d expenses 
we increased marketing  general and administrative or mg a expenses by to million in and by to million in mg a expenses increased due to the addition of new personnel  an increase in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions  increased marketing costs related to new products and our investment in infrastructure 
in  mg a expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue compared to because many of our mg a costs are fixed in the short term and because we obtained benefits from some of our mg a infrastructure investments 
since many of our mg a expenditures are fixed in the short term  these expenses may decline as a percentage of revenues in periods of rising revenues and may increase as a percentage of revenues in periods of declining revenue 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we recorded total deferred stock compensation expense of million in compared to million in and million in deferred compensation charges increased as a result of our acquisitions of toucan  extreme  aanetcom  qed and switchon 
these acquisitions contributed million to deferred stock compensation amortization in and all of the expense in and in addition  million of the expense in related to the unearned compensation recognized on the malleable and datum purchase acquisitions 
amortization of goodwill non cash goodwill charges increased to million in from million in and million in primarily as a result of the increase in goodwill recorded in connection with the malleable and datum acquisitions 
we may acquire products  technologies or companies in the future for which the purchase method of accounting may be used 
this could result in significant additional goodwill amortization or in process research and development charges in future periods  which could materially impact our operating results 
costs of merger merger costs were million in and million in the increase in merger costs resulted from the five pooling acquisitions we completed during compared to one pooling acquisition completed in these charges consist primarily of investment banking and other professional fees 
we may incur significant merger costs related to future acquisitions 
in process research and development ipr d ipr d charges were million in  nil in and million in the amounts expensed to in process research and development in arose from the acquisitions of malleable and datum 
we determined the fair value of the existing products as well as the technology that was currently under development using the income approach 
under the income approach  expected future after tax cash flows from each of the projects under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
these projected future cash flows were further adjusted for the value contributed by any core technology and development efforts expected to be completed post acquisition 
these forecasted cash flows were then discounted based on rates derived from our weighted average cost of capital  weighted average return on assets and venture capital rates of return adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
the risk adjusted discount rates used involved consideration of the characteristics and applications of each product  the inherent uncertainties in achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
after considering these factors  we determined the risk adjusted discount rates for malleable and datum to be and  respectively 
we believe that the pricing model used for products related to these acquisitions are standard within the high technology industry and that the estimated ipr d amounts so determined represent fair value and do not exceed the amounts that a third party would pay for these projects 
when we acquire companies we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
a description of the ipr d projects acquired are set forth below the in process technology acquired from malleable detects incoming voice channels and processes them using voice compression algorithms 
the compressed voice is converted  using the appropriate protocols  to atm cells or ip packets to achieve higher channel density and support multiple speech compression protocols and different packetization requirements 
at the date of acquisition we estimated that malleable s technology was complete and the costs to complete the project to be million 
the technology acquired from datum is a digitally controlled amplifier architecture  which was designed to increase basestation system capacities  while reducing cost  size and power consumption of radio networks 
at the date of acquisition  we estimated that datum s technology was complete and the costs to complete the project to be million 
the above estimates were determined by comparing the time and costs spent to date and the complexity of the technologies achieved to date to the total costs  time and complexities that were expected to be expended to bring the technologies to completion 
to date  progress and development costs incurred on the datum technology acquired from datum have been in line with the company s initial expectation 
progress on the malleable technology acquired has been slower than originally estimated and as a result  costs incurred on this project have exceeded our original estimates 
to date  costs incurred on development of this project have been million 
development of these technologies remains a significant risk to us due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  and testing activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
if we fail to bring these products to market in a timely manner  we could lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and our business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 
we have not achieved significant revenues from these acquisitions 
if we fail to achieve expected levels of revenues and net income from these products  our return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was completed will be negatively impacted and any other assets related to the development activities may become impaired 
in  we recorded ipr d expenses of million 
these charges include million related to the acquisition of integrated telecom technology  or igt  and million related to the acquisition of technology that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the allocation of the igt acquisition purchase price to ipr d  represented the estimated fair value of acquired ipr d using the methodology described above 
as of the acquisition date  igt had three development projects in process 
these projects were between and complete and the value assigned to each project was determined based on projected future cash flows discounted at a risk adjusted discount rate of between and 
the total estimated cost to complete these projects at the time of acquisition was million 
one of the igt projects related to the development of an atm switching system 
the second and third projects related to the segmentation and reassembly sar of data in an atm network 
we completed the first project in the first quarter of and were in full production by the end of the year 
we completed development of the second project in the fourth quarter of and were in full production in the first quarter of the time of completion and costs to complete were consistent with our initial estimates used in the valuation of the projects 
products related to these two projects have been introduced to the market in fiscal shipment volumes of products from acquired technologies are not material to our overall position at the present time and we are currently not able to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections due to the early stage of the product life cycles 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenues and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time the acquisition was completed and could potentially result in impairment of other assets related to the development activities 
impairment of intangible assets 
during the third quarter of  we terminated development work on a project and determined that a portion of the intangible assets recognized in connection with the igt acquisition was impaired 
we recorded a charge of million because the developed and core technology related to this project was not technologically feasible and had no alternative future use 
interest and other income  net  change change interest and other income  net percentage of net revenues interest income increased in compared to and in compared to as a result of higher cash balances available to earn interest 
other income in and included income from an equity interest in another company of million and million  respectively 
we decreased interest expense to million in from million in by retiring debt from loans and capital leases 
this reduction was partially offset by additional interest expense from debt assumed from the companies we acquired 
gain on sale of investments  change change gain on sale of investments percentage of net revenues our gains on sale of investments were million in  million in and nil in in  gains of million resulted from the sale of a portion of our investment in sierra wireless  inc  a public company 
additionally  we sold our remaining shares of cypress semiconductor  inc resulting in a gain of million 
in  we had gains of million from the sale of a portion of our sierra wireless shares 
during the year  we also had an investment in ic works  inc  or icw  a private company that was subsequently purchased by cypress semiconductor  a public company 
as a result of that transaction  we exchanged our preferred shares of icw for common shares of cypress semiconductor 
we disposed of a portion of our shares in cypress semiconductor  resulting in a gain of million 
provision for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a statutory tax rate of 
the increase in effective tax rate primarily reflects the higher provision for income taxes for our canadian subsidiary and the non tax deductible charges for in process research and development  goodwill amortization  deferred stock compensation and acquisition costs related to acquisitions completed during the year 
these factors were partially offset by the utilization of tax losses and other deferred tax assets for which benefits were previously not recognized 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  which approximated the statutory tax rate of 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was substantially higher than the statutory rate effective tax rate of due to the non tax deductible charges for in process research and development  goodwill amortization and impairment of intangible assets related to acquisitions completed during the year 
in addition a valuation allowance was taken against certain deferred tax assets during the year 
we have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  will require the recognition of all derivatives on the company s consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the company will adopt the new statement effective january  the initial adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at the end of from million at the end of during  operating activities provided million in cash 
net income of million included non cash charges of million for depreciation  million for amortization of intangibles  million amortization of deferred stock compensation  a million in process research and development charge and non operating gains on sale of investments of million 
our investing activities included the maturity of and reinvestment in short term investments 
we also made investments in other companies of million  purchased million of plant and equipment  spent net cash of million on the acquisitions of malleable  datum and octera  received million of proceeds from the sale of investments and paid out million in net wafer fabrication deposits 
in  our financing activities provided million 
we used million for net debt and lease repayments  and received million of proceeds from issuing common stock 
our principal source of liquidity at december  was our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we also have a line of credit with a bank that allows us to borrow up to million provided  along with other restrictions  that we do not pay cash dividends or make any material divestments without the bank s written consent 
by december   we had committed million of the available facility under letters of credit 
we have supply agreements with two independent foundries that supply substantially all of the wafers for our products 
we have made deposits to secure access to wafer fabrication capacity under both of these agreements 
at december  and  we had and million  respectively  in deposits with the foundries 
under these agreements  the foundries must supply certain quantities of wafers per year 
neither of these agreements have minimum unit volume requirements but we are obliged under one of the agreements to purchase a minimum percentage of our total annual wafer requirements provided that the foundry is able to continue to offer competitive technology  pricing  quality and delivery 
the agreements may be terminated if either party does not comply with the terms 
in each year  we are entitled to receive a refund of a portion of these deposits 
the amount to be received is based on the annual purchases from those foundries compared to the target levels in the agreements 
if we do not receive our deposits back during the term of the agreements  then they will be returned to us at the end of the term 
we purchased million in wafers from our foundry suppliers during compared to million in those amounts may not be indicative of any future period since wafer prices and our volume requirements may change 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy our projected working capital  venture investing  capital expenditure and wafer deposit requirements through we expect to spend approximately million on new capital additions and to make additional venture investments as opportunities arise in we will decrease our expenditures on capital additions if we do not grow as planned see outlook for outlook for several of our customers clients  particularly internet service providers and competitive local exchange carriers  have recently reported lower than expected demand growth for their services or products 
for most of these companies  this has resulted in poor operating results and difficulty obtaining the capital required to build their networks 
many of these companies may delay equipment purchases or become insolvent in the near future 
the larger incumbent carriers  as a group  have announced plans to slow the rate of growth of their capital expenditures 
these factors  along with symptoms of a general economic slowdown in the united states  have lowered the demand for equipment at several of our significant customers  many of whom have announced large component inventories and declines in expected operating results 
we expect softening demand for our customers services and products  and our customers depletion of large inventories of our networking products will have a negative impact on our total revenue and gross profit 
we expect revenues and gross profit to decline materially in at least the first two quarters of as our networking customers adjust to lower demand for their equipment and absorb their inventories of our networking products 
we intend to reduce spending on r d and mg a because of our expected revenue decline  we expect these expenses to increase as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we continue to focus on developing additional networking products 
we expect that any cost rationalization efforts  such as employee layoffs or office consolidation  will result in a restructuring charge when implemented 
factors that you should consider before investing in pmc sierra our company is subject to a number of risks some are normal to the fabless networking semiconductor industry  some are the same or similar to those disclosed in previous sec filings  and some may be present in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing in pmc 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
as a result of these risks  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we are subject to rapid changes in demand for our products due to customer inventory levels  production schedules  end networking equipment demand fluctuations and our customer concentration our customers may cancel or delay the purchase of our products to manage their inventory or for various other reasons our customers routinely build inventories of our products in anticipation of end demand for their products 
many of our customers have numerous product lines  numerous component requirements for each product  sizeable and complex supplier structures  and often engage contract manufacturers to supplement their manufacturing capacity 
this makes forecasting their production requirements difficult and can lead to an inventory surplus of certain of their suppliers components 
our customers often shift buying patterns as they manage inventory levels  decide to use competing products  are acquired or divested  market different products  change production schedules or change their orders for other reasons 
if one or more customers were to delay  reduce or cancel orders  our overall order levels may fluctuate greatly  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
recently  many of our customers indicated that they have accumulated significant inventories of our chips when compared to their own recently reduced shipment forecasts and have consequently reduced or delayed the desired shipment date of their orders 
this has materially reduced our visibility of future revenue streams and caused an increase in our inventory levels 
we expect that this will significantly reduce our operating results  in at least the next two fiscal quarters 
if demand for our customers products changes  including due to a downturn in the networking industry  our revenues could decline several of our customers clients  particularly competitive local exchange carriers and internet service providers  have recently reported lower than expected demand growth for their services or products  which has resulted in poor operating results and difficulty accessing the capital needed to build their networks or survive to profitability 
many of these companies may become insolvent in the near future 
this  along with symptoms of a general economic slowdown in the united states  has affected the end demand at several of our significant customers  many of whom have announced large component inventories and declines in expected operating results 
in response  many of our customers and their contract manufacturers have undertaken expenditure and inventory reduction initiatives and have canceled or rescheduled orders with us 
these actions may continue in future periods and may accelerate if conditions worsen for our customers 
we expect these business conditions to materially affect our operating results in at least the next two fiscal quarters 
in addition  while all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  our customers products are sold worldwide 
while the current networking equipment market downturn may have been limited to the united states  the networking markets in the rest of the world could soon follow 
any decline in the world networking markets could seriously depress our customers order levels for pmc products 
this effect could be further exacerbated if fluctuations in currency exchange rates further depress the demand for our customers products 
we rely on a few customers for a major portion of our sales  any one of which could materially impact our revenues should they change their ordering pattern we depend on a limited number of customers for a major portion of our revenues 
through direct  distributor and subcontractor purchases  cisco systems and lucent technologies each accounted for more than of our fiscal and fiscal revenues 
both of these companies have recently announced order shortfalls for their products 
we do not have long term volume purchase commitments from any of our major customers 
because our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  fluctuations in our revenues can cause proportionately greater fluctuations in our operating results many of our research  development  marketing  general and administrative expenses are fixed from a short term perspective  while our revenues are not 
thus  if our revenues fluctuate  our profit will fluctuate at a greater percentage than our revenues 
pmc s rapid growth has strained our resources  and we may not be able to manage future growth pmc has experienced a period of rapid growth  which has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our resources 
we increased our employee headcount to  at the end of from at the end of  expanded our operations and facilities  and increased the responsibilities of management 
we are experiencing typical challenges in integrating the number of acquisitions 
this process is absorbing a high percentage of management time that must be diverted from other areas of our operations 
while we expect our revenue to decline in the near term  we may return to historical growth levels over the long term 
if this revenue swing occurs  our management  manufacturing  product development  financial  information systems and other resources may be strained 
in addition  our systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support growth in our operations 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california s current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
our sales headquarters and a significant proportion of our research and development and production facilities reside in california 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could delay the introduction of new products  frustrate our sales efforts  damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in by the california government has caused power prices to increase 
under deregulation  utilities were encouraged to sell their plants  which traditionally had produced most of california s power  to independent energy companies that were expected to compete aggressively on price 
instead  due in part to a shortage of supply  wholesale prices have skyrocketed over the past year 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and we may have difficulty collecting receivables from customers based in foreign countries many of our customers outsource the manufacturing of their products to contract manufacturers and the inventory management of our product through our major distributor 
many of these entities have built large inventories of our products and generally represent greater credit risk than our networking equipment customers 
the bulk of the revenues for several of our customers come from companies that have recently reported lower than expected demand growth for their services or products  such as competitive local exchange carriers and internet service providers 
this has materially and adversely affected some of our customers  some of which may become insolvent in the near future 
we sell our products to customers around the world 
payment cycle norms in these countries may not be consistent with our standard payment terms 
thus  we may have greater difficulty collecting receivables on time from customers in these countries 
in addition  we may be faced with greater difficulty in collecting outstanding balances due to the sheer distances between our collection facilities and our customers  and we may be unable to enforce receivable collection in foreign nations due to their business legal systems 
if one or more of our customers delays payment or does not pay their outstanding receivable  our balance sheet may be materially impacted or we may be forced to write off the account 
our business strategy contemplates acquisition of other companies or technologies  which could adversely affect our operating performance pmc closed eight acquisitions in fiscal acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties is an integral part of our business strategy 
management may be diverted from our operations while they identify and negotiate these acquisitions and integrate an acquired entity into our operations 
also  we may be forced to develop expertise outside our existing businesses  and replace key personnel who leave due to an acquisition 
we have not previously attempted to integrate several acquisitions simultaneously and may not succeed in this effort 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt obligations  or issue additional equity 
if we issue more equity  we may dilute our common stock with securities that have an equal or a senior interest 
acquired entities also may have unknown liabilities  and the combined entity may not achieve the results that were anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
pmc has not yet achieved revenues from some of its recent acquisitions the products from six of the companies pmc has acquired in fiscal have been incorporated into customer equipment designs that have yet to generate significant revenue for pmc 
these or any follow on products may not achieve commercial success 
these acquisitions may not generate future revenues or earnings 
the timing of revenues from newly designed products is often uncertain 
in the past  we have had to redesign products that we acquired when buying other businesses  resulting in increased expenses and delayed revenues 
this may occur in the future as we commercialize the new products resulting from recent acquisitions 
pmc began designing digital signal processors with the acquisitions of toucan  malleable and datum 
prior to these acquisitions  pmc had limited design expertise in this technology  and may fail to bring digital signal processing products to market successfully 
in addition  datum s technology is applicable to the radio frequency wireless networking market a market in which pmc had little experience 
if our customers use our competitors products instead of ours  suffer a decline in demand for their products or are acquired or sold  our revenues may decline we are experiencing significantly greater competition from many different market participants as the market in which we participate matures 
in addition  we are expanding into markets that have established incumbents that have substantial financial and technological resources 
we expect fiercer competition than that which we have traditionally faced as some of these incumbents derive a majority of their earnings from these markets 
all of our competitors pose the following threats to pmc as our customers increase the frequency by which they design next generation systems and select the chips for those new systems  our competitors have an increased opportunity to convince our customers to switch to their products  which may cause our revenues to decline the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological advancement in design tools  wafer manufacturing techniques  process tools and alternate networking technologies 
we must identify and capture future market opportunities to offset the rapid price erosion that characterizes our industry 
we may not be able to develop new products at competitive pricing and performance levels 
even if we are able to do so  we may not complete a new product and introduce it to market in a timely manner 
our customers may substitute use of our products in their next generation equipment with those of current or future competitors 
we typically face competition at the design stage  where customers evaluate alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to supplant our products in next generation systems because the product life and design in cycles in many of our customers products 
increasing competition in our industry will make it more difficult to earn design wins in our customer s equipment major domestic and international semiconductor companies  such as intel  ibm  lucent technologies and motorola  are concentrating an increasing amount of their substantially greater financial and other resources on the markets in which we participate 
this represents a serious competitive threat to pmc 
emerging companies also provide significant competition in our segment of the semiconductor market  while our peers are becoming mature  successful and sophisticated 
our competitors include applied micro circuits corporation  broadcom  conexant systems  cypress semiconductor  dallas semiconductor  exar corporation  integrated device technology  ibm  infineon  intel  lucent technologies including agere  marvell technology group  motorola  multilink technology corporation  nortel networks  texas instruments  transwitch and vitesse semiconductor 
over the next few years  we expect additional competitors  some of which may also have greater financial and other resources  to enter the market with new products 
in addition  we are aware of venture backed companies that focus on specific portions of our broad range of products 
these companies  individually or collectively  could represent future competition for many design wins  and subsequent product sales 
competition is particularly strong in the market for optical networking and optical telecommunication chips  in part due to the market s growth rate  which attracts larger competitors  and in part due to the number of smaller companies focused on this area 
these companies  individually or collectively  represent strong competition for many design wins  and subsequent product sales 
larger competitors in our market have recently acquired or announced plans to acquire both publicly traded and privately held companies with advanced technologies 
these acquisitions could enhance the ability of larger competitors to obtain new business that pmc might have otherwise won 
we must often redesign our products to meet rapidly evolving industry standards and customer specifications  which may delay an increase in our revenues we sell products to a market whose characteristics include rapidly evolving industry standards  product obsolescence  and new manufacturing and design technologies 
many of the standards and protocols for our products are based on high speed networking technologies that have not been widely adopted or ratified by one or more of the standard setting bodies in our customers industry 
our customers often delay or alter their design demands during this standard setting process 
in response  we must redesign our products to suit these changing demands 
redesign usually delays the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays 
since we develop products many years before their volume production  if we inaccurately anticipate our customers needs  our revenues may not increase our products generally take between and months from initial conceptualization to development of a viable prototype  and another to months to be designed into our customers equipment and into production 
they often need to be redesigned because manufacturing yields on prototypes are unacceptable or customers redefine their products to meet changing industry standards or customer specifications 
as a result  we develop products many years before volume production and may inaccurately anticipate our customers needs 
there have been times when we either designed products that had more features than were demanded when they were introduced to the market or conceptualized products that were not sufficiently feature rich to meet the needs of our customers or compete effectively against our competitors 
this may happen again 
if the recent trend of consolidation in the networking industry continues  our customers may be acquired or sold  which could cause those customers to cancel product lines or development projects and our revenues to decline the networking equipment industry has experienced significant merger activity and partnership programs 
through mergers or partnerships  our customers could seek to remove redundancies in their product lines or development initiatives 
this could lead to the cancellation of a product line into which pmc products are designed or a development project on which pmc is participating 
in the cases of a product line cancellation  pmc revenues could be materially impacted 
in the case of a development project cancellation  we may be forced to cancel development of one or more products  which could mean opportunities for future revenues from this development initiative could be lost 
the loss of personnel could preclude us from designing new products to succeed  we must retain and hire technical personnel highly skilled at the design and test functions used to develop high speed networking products and related software 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we  along with our peers  customers and other companies in the communications industry  are facing intense competition for those employees from our peers and an increasing number of startup companies which are emerging with potentially lucrative employee ownership arrangements 
we do not have employment agreements in place with our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of grant and that are subject to vesting 
recently  our stock price has declined substantially 
the stock options we grant to employees are effective as retention incentives only if they have economic value 
pmc s operating results may be impacted differently depending on which method we use to account for acquisitions a future acquisition could adversely affect operating results  particularly if we record the acquisition as a purchase such as the malleable and datum acquisitions 
in purchase acquisitions  we may incur a significant charge for purchased in process research and development in the period in which the acquisition is closed 
in addition  we may capitalize a significant goodwill or other intangible assets that would be amortized over their expected period of benefit 
the resulting amortization expense could seriously impact operating results for many years 
pmc may enter into additional purchase acquisitions in the future 
we have accounted for a number of our recent mergers as pooling of interests 
if  after completion of these mergers  events occur that cause the merger to fail to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment  the purchase method of accounting would apply 
purchase accounting treatment would seriously harm the reported operating results of the combined company because the estimated fair value of pmc common stock issued in the mergers is much greater than the historical net book value of the assets in each of the acquired company s accounts 
if the market does not accept the recently developed specifications and protocols on which our new products are based  we may not be able to sustain or increase our revenues some of our other recently introduced products adhere to specifications developed by industry groups for transmissions of data signals  or packets  over high speed fiber optics transmission standards 
these transmission standards are called synchronous optical network  or sonet  in north america  and synchronous data hierarchy  or sdh  in europe 
the specifications  commonly called packet over sonet sdh  may be rejected for other technologies  such as mapping ip directly onto fiber 
in addition  we cannot be sure whether our products will compete effectively with packet over sonet sdh offerings of other companies 
a substantial portion of our business also relies on continued industry acceptance of asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  products 
atm is a networking protocol 
while atm has been an industry standard for a number of years  the overall atm market has not developed as rapidly as some observers had predicted it would 
as a result  competing communications technologies  including gigabit and fast ethernet and packet over sonet sdh  may inhibit the future growth of atm and our sales of atm products 
a significant portion of pmc s revenues relate to sales of our mips based processors 
if mips technologies develops future generations of its technology  we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms 
mips technologies has introduced  and will likely continue to introduce  new generations of its microprocessor technology architecture containing improvements that are not covered by the technology we are currently licensing from mips technologies 
a significant part of our success could depend on our ability to develop products that incorporate those improvements 
we may not be able to license the technology for any new improvements from mips technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we cannot obtain required licenses from mips technologies  we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to develop similar technology  or we may not be able to develop  manufacture and sell products incorporating this technology 
in addition  our current microprocessor products and planned future products are based upon the microprocessor technology we license from mips technologies 
if we fail to comply with any of the terms of its license agreement  mips technologies could terminate our rights  preventing us from marketing our current and planned microprocessor products 
we anticipate lower margins on mature and high volume products  which could adversely affect our profitability we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices of products 
if we price our products too high  our customers may use a competitor s product or an in house solution 
to maintain profit margins  we must reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in average selling prices  or successfully sell proportionately more new products with higher average selling prices 
yield or other production problems  or shortages of supply may preclude us from lowering or maintaining current operating costs 
our networking products range widely in terms of the margins they generate 
a change in product sales mix could impact our operating results materially 
we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products if we do not accurately predict demand or if we fail to secure adequate wafer fabrication or assembly capacity we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and demand for their end user networking equipment and because we supply a large number of products to a variety of customers and contract manufacturers who have many equipment programs for which they purchase pmc products 
if we do not accurately predict what mix of products our customers may order  we may not be able to meet our customers demand in a timely manner and may be left with unwanted inventory 
recently  our customers have significantly delayed  canceled or otherwise changed future ordering patterns 
if these or other customers do not order the products we have in stock  we could be left with unwanted inventory 
in addition  if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to increase productive capacity in line with demand  we may suffer supply shortages or be allocated supply 
additionally  since our products use a wide range of process technologies  we may not be able to secure the specific wafer capacity for the specific mix of products we demand 
a shortage in supply could adversely impact our ability to satisfy customer demand  which could adversely affect our customer relationships along with our current and future operating results 
recently  our suppliers  particularly silicon wafer suppliers  have experienced an increase in the demand for their products or services 
if our silicon wafer or other suppliers are unable or unwilling to increase productive capacity in line with the growth in demand  we may suffer longer production lead times 
longer production lead times require that we forecast the demand for our products further into the future 
thus  a greater proportion of our manufacturing orders will be based on forecasts  rather than actual customers orders 
this increases the likelihood of forecasting errors 
these forecasting errors could lead to excess inventory in certain products and insufficient inventory in others  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we rely on limited sources of wafer fabrication  the loss of which could delay and limit our product shipments we do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
three outside foundries supply most of our semiconductor device requirements 
our foundry suppliers also produce products for themselves and other companies 
in addition  we may not have access to adequate capacity or certain process technologies 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
if the foundries we use are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes  we may have to identify and qualify acceptable additional or alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer 
we may not find sufficient capacity quickly enough  if ever  to satisfy our production requirements 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
we depend on third parties in asia for assembly of our semiconductor products that could delay and limit our product shipments sub assemblers in asia assemble all of our semiconductor products 
raw material shortages  political and social instability  assembly house service disruptions  currency fluctuations  or other circumstances in the region could force us to seek additional or alternative sources of supply or assembly 
this could lead to supply constraints or product delivery delays that  in turn  may result in the loss of customers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  assembly processes  quality assurances and costs than competitors that do not outsource these tasks 
we depend on a limited number of design software suppliers  the loss of which could impede our product development a limited number of suppliers provide the computer aided design  or cad  software we use to design our products 
factors affecting the price  availability or technical capability of these products could affect our ability to access appropriate cad tools for the development of highly complex products 
in particular  the cad software industry has been the subject of extensive intellectual property rights litigation  the results of which could materially change the pricing and nature of the software we use 
we also have limited control over whether our software suppliers will be able to overcome technical barriers in time to fulfill our needs 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than companies that operate their businesses mostly in the united states  which may impair our sales  development or manufacturing of our products we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than most companies because  in addition to selling our products in a number of countries  a significant portion of our research and development and manufacturing is conducted outside of the united states 
pmc s geographic expansion  acquisitions and growth rate could hinder its ability to coordinate design and sales activities 
if pmc is unable to develop systems and communication processes to support its expanding geographic diversity  it may suffer product development delays or strained customer relationships 
we may lose our ability to design or produce products  could face additional unforeseen costs or could lose access to key customers if any of the nations in which we conduct business impose trade barriers or new communications standards we may have difficulty obtaining export licenses for certain technology produced for us outside the united states 
if a foreign country imposes new taxes  tariffs  quotas  and other trade barriers and restrictions or the united states and a foreign country develop hostilities or change diplomatic and trade relationships  we may not be able to continue manufacturing or sub assembly of our products in that country and may have fewer sales in that country 
we may also have fewer sales in a country that imposes new communications standards or technologies 
this could inhibit our ability to meet our customers demand for our products and lower our revenues 
if foreign exchange rates fluctuate significantly  our profitability may decline we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations because a significant part of our development  test  marketing and administrative costs are denominated in canadian dollars  and our selling costs are denominated in a variety of currencies around the world 
in addition  a number of the countries in which we have sales offices have a history of imposing exchange rate controls 
this could make it difficult to withdraw the foreign currency denominated assets we hold in these countries 
we are defendants in several outstanding legal proceedings about which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities upon judgment 
we are defendants in a number of legal proceedings that we believe will have immaterial consequences or are unable to assess our level of exposure 
these proceedings could create a material charge to our operating results in the future if our exposure increases or if our ability to assess our exposure becomes clearer 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology  we may not be able to prevent competitors from copying our technology and selling similar products  which would harm our revenues to compete effectively  we must protect our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we hold several patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
we might not succeed in attaining patents from any of our pending applications 
even if we are awarded patents  they may not provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  as they may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or may not be issued in all countries where our products can be sold 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
we develop  manufacture and sell our products in asian and other countries that may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this makes piracy of our technology and products more likely 
steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent theft of our technology 
we may not be able to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are similar to or better than ours 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation and prevent us from selling our products vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions characterize the semiconductor industry 
this often results in expensive and lengthy litigation 
we  as well as our customers or suppliers  may be accused of infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
this has happened in the past 
an adverse result in any litigation could force us to pay substantial damages  stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue using certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  we may not be able to develop non infringing technology  nor might we be able to find appropriate licenses on reasonable terms 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry are often settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we currently do not have a substantial portfolio of patents compared to our larger competitors  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we are therefore more exposed to third party claims than some of our larger competitors and customers 
in the past  our customers have been required to obtain licenses from and pay royalties to third parties for the sale of systems incorporating our semiconductor devices 
until december of  we indemnified our customers up to the dollar amount of their purchases of our products found to be infringing on technology owned by third parties 
customers may also make claims against us with respect to infringement 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringing our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this could consume significant resources and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the litigation s outcome 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have priority rights to your investment 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms we or you will find favorable 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our customers results fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change or investors change their sentiment toward technology stocks 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
short term investments we maintain a short term investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities of less than one year 
to minimize credit risk the short term investments are diversified and generally consist of either commercial paper  rated p by moody s and a or higher by standard and poor s  or auction rate preferred s with a rating of aaa aaa 
these securities are generally classified as held to maturity and accordingly are recorded on the balance sheet at cost 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we were to sell securities which have declined in market value because of changes in interest rates 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
under this policy  all short term investments must be made in investment grade securities with original maturities of less than one year at the time of acquisition 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments due to the short term nature of the investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the fair value of our short term investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by an immediate hypothetical parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps or bps 
other investments other investments at december  include a minority investment in sierra wireless inc  a publicly traded company  half of which has been classified as available for sale 
consequently  these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the value of our investment in these shares is subject to considerable market price volatility 
for example  as a result of recent market price volatility  the unrealized gain on this investment  net of tax  recorded at december  of million has  as of march   been reduced to an unrealized gain  net of tax  of approximately  million 
our other investments also include numerous investments in privately held companies and our remaining investment in sierra wireless inc shares which are subject to certain resale restrictions and are therefore carried at cost 
our investments in private companies are inherently risky as they typically consist of investments in companies which are still in the start up or development stages 
the market for the technologies or products that they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our investment in the sierra wireless inc shares which are subject to certain resale restrictions are subject to the same market volatility as the available for sale securities noted above with an additional risk due to the resale restriction 
accordingly  we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
foreign currency we generate a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside of the united states including canada  europe and the middle east and asia 
we are subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
our sales and corresponding receivables are made primarily in united states dollars 
through our operations in canada and elsewhere outside of the united states  we incur research and development  customer support costs and administrative expenses in canadian and other local currencies 
we are exposed  in the normal course of business  to foreign currency risks on these expenditures 
in our effort to manage such risks  we have adopted a foreign currency risk management policy intended to reduce the effects of potential short term fluctuations on the results of operations stemming from our exposure to these risks 
as part of this risk management  we typically forecast our operational currency needs  purchase such currency on the open market at the beginning of an operational period  and hold these funds as a hedge against currency fluctuations 
we usually limit the operational period to months or less 
while we expect to utilize this method of managing our foreign currency risk in the future  we may change our foreign currency risk management methodology and utilize foreign exchange contracts that are currently available under our operating line of credit agreement 
the purpose of our foreign currency risk management policy is to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 
therefore  while our foreign currency risk management policy may reduce our exposure to losses resulting from unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates  it also reduces or eliminates our ability to profit from favorable changes in currency exchange rates 
occasionally  we may not be able to correctly forecast our operational needs 
if our forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at the end of  we did not have significant foreign currency denominated net asset or net liability positions  and we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts
