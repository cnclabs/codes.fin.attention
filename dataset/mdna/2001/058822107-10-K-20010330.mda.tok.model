item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity historically have been and are expected to continue to be cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under short term lines of credit 
effective january   the company increased its borrowing capacity under its domestic line of credit to million 
the company also continues to have lines of credit in ecuador and europe totaling approximately million 
working capital and borrowing requirements increased in and are expected to continue to increase as a result of the company s expanded operations as a seafood importer as well as organic growth in its core material business 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded by a combination of cash generated from operations and outside financing  if necessary 
the company s financial position remains strong 
at december   the company had working capital of million compared to million at december  cash was provided and used in varying amounts during the two year period  principally as a result of changes in the elements of current assets and current liabilities and in the amount of cash provided by net income 
inventories and accounts receivable increased in both years due to the company s expansion into the seafood import business 
the company s short term borrowings  which were used to finance higher working capital requirements  also increased in cash used in investing activities for the three year period was due to investments in balsa plantations  purchase of new equipment in addition to replacement of old equipment and structural improvements of the shrimp ponds 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company had unused lines of credit of approximately million with a domestic bank  approximately million with ecuadorian banks and approximately million with european banks for working capital purposes 
the company expects that future operations and its unused lines of credit will provide sufficient resources to support its planned expansion and maintain its favorable liquid position 
results of operations for the years ended december   and total sales increased  and in  and  respectively 
the gains in all three years were due to increased core materials sales and higher seafood sales in and core material sales were   and  in  and  respectively 
the continued robust economy has resulted in strong demand in all industries that use core materials  including the company s largest customer group  the boating industry 
many of the company s end user markets  including boating  are highly cyclical 
demand within those industries is dependent upon  among other factors  discretionary income  inflation  interest rates and consumer confidence 
fluctuating interest rates and other changes in economic conditions make it difficult to forecast short or long range trends 
the increase in core material sales in compared to was due to higher volume 
the company s revenues for the year ended december  were negatively affected by the fluctuation of foreign currencies  particularly those of its european subsidiaries  compared to the us dollar 
seafood sales were   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was the result of a significant decline in sales of shrimp  partially offset by improved sales of seafood products from the company s import business 
the amount of shrimp produced at the company s farms in declined by compared to and compared to  as described below 
the increase in was due to sales from the import business  and the increase in due to a higher volume of shrimp shipped 
the overall gross margin as a percentage of sales remained the same in compared to  decreased in and increased in the typical margin in the seafood import business is lower than the company s historical margins realized as a core materials producer distributor and shrimp producer 
the overall margin is therefore determined not only by the margins in each segment but also by the mix of seafood and materials sales 
the margin for the company s core products improved in and remained approximately the same in after increasing in the margins improved due to improved pricing and  in  due to the one time benefit realized from the devaluation of the sucre when ecuador converted its national currency to the us dollar 
the margins from seafood sales decreased in  and the white spot virus continued to negatively affect the shrimp farms  resulting in significantly lower production and revenues 
the company is taking all possible steps to mitigate the effect of this disease on its farms but no definitive determination can be made as to its longevity and affect on shrimp prices in the marketplace 
the decrease in margins in is attributable to a higher volume of shrimp purchased from outside suppliers  which have lower margins than shrimp grown at the company s own farms 
a decline in shrimp market prices during also adversely affected the company s margins from its seafood import business 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased in after declining in and s  g a increased in primarily as a result of increases in selling expenses 
in dollar terms s  g a expenses have increased as a result of the company s growth 
the seafood import business  which began during the first quarter of  had a lower percentage of s  g a expenses to revenues as compared to the company s historical relationship 
this  as expected  reduced s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales in and sales and expenses were affected in all three years by the different exchange rates applied in translating the books of accounts of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
interest expense decreased in and after increasing in in and  the company s short term borrowings for working capital purposes in ecuador were primarily us dollar denominated loans 
in  the company borrowed money for working capital purposes in ecuador in local currency sucre denominated loans 
the sucre based loans bear higher interest rates than us dollar loans  which was partially offset by gains resulting from the devaluation of the sucre 
this practice increased interest expense in but created a corresponding foreign exchange gain 
the company s interest rate on us loans was higher in and its average borrowings were lower in as compared to the level of borrowing in all periods is related to the company s working capital needs and cash flows generated from operations 
the company had a foreign exchange loss of  and  in and  respectively  compared to a gain in of  gains were realized in due mainly to the company s sucre based loans described above 
translation gains and losses are mainly caused by the relationship of the us dollar to the foreign currencies in the countries where the company operates  and arise when translating foreign currency balance sheets into us dollars 
the company utilizes foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain inventory purchases and may also employ certain strategies whose objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
the company has not and does not intend to enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
management is unable to forecast the impact of translation gains or losses on future periods due to the unpredictability in the fluctuation of foreign exchange 
the effective income tax rate amounted to in  in and in reconciliation of the effective rate with the us statutory rate is detailed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
ecuador dollarization the ecuadorian government has completed its plans to adopt the us dollar as its national currency 
during the month of september  the us dollar officially replaced the sucre  and the sucre was removed from circulation 
in accordance with the local regulations  the company has converted its accounting and financial books and records from the sucre to the us dollar

 and sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  was adopted by the company on january  sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
adoption of these new accounting standards will result in a one time cumulative after tax reduction in net income of approximately  and other comprehensive income of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal for the initial adoption of sfas  as amended 
the adoption will also impact assets and liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet
