interest rate protection in order to reduce exposure to variable interest rates  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements as follows fixed interest rate notional amount vs 
day libor maturity date million june million december million december financial instruments sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates

changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but  it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position
