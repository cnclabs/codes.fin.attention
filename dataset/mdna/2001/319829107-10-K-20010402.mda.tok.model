the corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
the corporation acquired southwest national corporation and its subsidiary southwest effective december  the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  all financial statements have been restated as though the merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
during the fourth quarter of the corporation formed first commonwealth insurance agency fcia as a subsidiary of first commonwealth bank fcb  a commercial banking subsidiary of the corporation 
fcia began marketing a wide range of insurance and annuity products to the corporation s retail and commercial customers beginning january  on october   the corporation s board of directors approved a for stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend 
shareholders of record at the close of business november  received one additional share for each share held 
the additional shares were distributed on november  share data for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the stock split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
financial statements amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the presentation format used in the reclassifications had no effect on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations net income in was million  reflecting a decrease of million from results of million and compared to million reported in the decrease in net income for was primarily the result of gains on sale of loans which were realized during the period was impacted negatively by a number of merger and other related charges totaling million 
these charges included merger expenses for the acquisition of southwest national corporation  early retirement and postretirement benefit accruals and premises and equipment expenses to standardize depreciation methods 
extraordinary items for resulted from a single transaction whereby the corporation incurred a cost of thousand for the prepayment of fhlb term borrowings 
this transaction was executed as part of the corporation s repositioning of its balance sheet to reduce exposure to declining interest rates

b income on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis  and the loan balances are included in interest earning assets 
c loan income includes net loan fees 
d average balances do not include reallocations from noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into savings deposits which were made for regulatory purposes 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued both interest income and interest expense increased over levels as a result of both volume increased and rate increases 
average interest earning assets increased million while average interest bearing liabilities increased million in asset yields  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points during to  from reported in and compared to reported in the cost of funds for increased basis points over costs of and compared to costs of for interest and fees on loans increased million for over levels  primarily as a result of volume and rate increases for commercial loans 
enhanced marketing strategies continue to enable the corporation to capitalize on lending opportunities with small to mid sized commercial customers  including small business administration sba loans generated through the corporation s preferred lender status 
average loans for increased million compared to averages and included increases in commercial loans and municipal loans which were partially offset by decreases in average consumer loans 
the decrease in average consumer loans for the period resulted from the sale of million of family residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of and the sale of million of consumer credit card loans during the second quarter of interest and fees on loans also reflected increases due to rate of million during as loan yields increased basis points during to from reported for and compared to during mortgage portfolio yields rose basis points for compared to as teaser rates on innovative loan products introduced in previous years were phased out 
yields on commercial loans  municipal loans  and both secured and unsecured revolving credit loans for also reflected increases compared to yields reflecting the increase in general interest rates 
interest income on investments increased million for compared to  as rate increases during were only partially offset by volume decreases 
yields on investments for were compared to for and for increases in interest income due to rate for us government agency securities were million during as yields on us government agency securities increased basis points compared to yields 
prepayment speeds of mortgage backed securities which had slowed during as interest rates rose  began to accelerate at the end of as interest rates began to decline 
the primary risk of owning mbs relates to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayment speeds generally decline  resulting in a longer average life of a mbs 
conversely as interest rates decline  prepayment speeds increase  resulting in a shorter average life of a mbs 
using computer simulation models  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility of all mbss under various interest rate scenarios on a regular basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities 
decreases in interest income on investments due to volume of million during resulted primarily from volume decreases for us government agency securities which were partially offset by volume increases for corporate bonds 
average balances of us government agency securities decreased million for compared to averages as an inverted yield curve prevented a reinvestment of proceeds generated by paydowns at a positive spread 
average balances of corporate bonds increased million over the same time period primarily as a result of investment in trust preferred securities 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued interest on deposits increased million for compared to as both volumes and rates increased over levels 
average time deposits increased million for compared to  resulting in an increase in interest expense due to volume of million 
increases in average time deposits for compared to averages were partially offset by decreases in average savings deposits of million

interest on total savings deposits for also reflected increases due to rate of million as deposit costs for total savings deposits increased basis points for compared to average balances of noninterest bearing demand deposits for reflected an increase of million compared to averages 
interest expense on short term borrowings increased million during as the average balance of repurchase agreements increased million 
the cost of short term borrowings for also increased by basis points compared to costs of 
interest expense on long term debt increased million for compared to the period 
the long term debt increase for resulted primarily from the funding of the repurchase of million shares of the corporation s common stock through a modified dutch auction tender offer during the aggregate amount of million paid by the corporation in connection with the repurchase of common shares was funded through the issuance of capital securities and the issuance of a bank loan from an unrelated financial institution 
capital securities borrowings in the amount of million were issued during the third quarter of bearing an interest rate of and maturing in thirty years  consequently interest expense on capital securities for was million compared to million for the parent company incurred a million bank loan during primarily to fund the remaining cost of the stock repurchase

the amount of the provision is determined by management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance in relation to the risks inherent within the loan portfolio 
the provision for credit losses was million in compared to million in and million in the period contains an additional provision of million recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect changing economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses was million at december   for a ratio of of actual loans outstanding 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans outstanding as of december  has increased slightly from the reported as of december  net charge offs for reflected increases in charge offs of commercial loans not secured by real estate of million and revolving credit loans of thousand which were partially offset by decreases in net charge offs of family residential mortgages  consumer installment and commercial loans secured by real estate

the securities gains during resulted in part from the sales of fixed rate us government agency securities and us treasury securities classified as securities available for sale having book values of million and million  respectively  which resulted in securities gains of thousand and thousand  respectively 
proceeds from the sale of us treasury securities in were the primary funding source for the acquisition of million of bank owned life insurance during the first quarter of the security gains during resulted in part from the third and fourth quarter sales of floating collateralized mortgage obligations classified as securities available for sale having book values of million and million respectively  which resulted in security gains of million during the third quarter and security losses of thousand during the fourth quarter 
these securities were sold to reduce the exposure to accelerated prepayments in a declining interest rate environment 
the million proceeds from the sale of securities in the third quarter of were used to reduce outstanding federal funds purchased while the million proceeds in the fourth quarter of were reinvested in higher yielding municipal securities 
the securities gains also included the sale of us treasury securities having a book value of million with the proceeds being reinvested in mortgage backed and other us government agency securities with similar average expected maturities and the sale of pennsylvania bank stocks having a book value of million 
securities losses of thousand were incurred during the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of the sale of mutual funds classified as equity securities having a book value of million 
trust income of million for compared to million for and million for enhanced referral programs and integrated growth plans for financial affiliates have been initiated to help improve sales in various areas including trust assets managed 
additional noninterest income analysis is planned for through the use of recently implemented customer and product profitability systems 
conversion of deposit processing systems utilized by the corporation s data processing subsidiary to new software during will facilitate the offering of enhanced deposit products and services which are expected to increase deposit fees in future periods 
gains on sale of loans decreased million for from gains on sale of loans of million and compared to million reported in gains on sale of loans for the period resulted primarily from the sale of million of residential mortgage loans during the first quarter of and the sale of its million retail credit card loans during the second quarter of which generated gains of thousand and million  respectively 
gains on sale of loans for resulted primarily from the sale of million of family residential mortgage loans during the fourth quarter of which resulted in a gain of million 
other income for was million representing an increase of million over income of million and compared to for other income for the period reflected a gain on sale of fixed assets of thousand and increases in merchant discount of thousand and mac interchange fees of thousand compared to revenues 
insurance commissions  which have continued to increases since fcia s formation in  generated increases of thousand during compared to other income for the period also included an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of million  resulting from claim income and the impact of an additional million investment during as a result of branch analysis including the evaluation of the potential sale or consolidation of branches competing in the same market area  the corporation sold two of its branches located in state college  pennsylvania during that resulted in a gain of thousand  which is included in other revenue for first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued total other operating expenses increased million to million for compared to million and million in and  respectively 
total noninterest expense as a percent of average assets was for the period compared to for employee costs were million in  representing of average assets compared to million and of average assets for employee costs for were million or of average assets 
salary and benefit costs for were negatively impacted by decreases in deferred loan origination costs as loan volumes for decreased over volumes 
although increases in employee insurance expenses of thousand represented an increase of for compared to  these increases were less than anticipated 
the corporation continues to address hospitalization and other employee insurance costs in future periods by utilizing the expertise of fcia s staff to enable dependable and high quality benefits to be offered in the most cost effective manner 
additional increases in employee benefit costs during occurred in k plan expenses as employees took advantage of contribution and investment enhancements to the plan instituted during the period included decreases in employee benefit costs for pension and postretirement benefits totaling thousand at southwest as a result of plan curtailment discussed below 
salary and benefit costs increased only for compared to and were favorably impacted by the early retirement plan offered to employees during the fourth quarter of the success of the early retirement plan accelerated the process of right sizing the corporation beyond normal attrition management by adjusting employment levels quickly while continuing the corporation s tradition of not laying off employees due to merger activity 
furniture and equipment expenses of million for reflected increases of thousand over levels and included increases in software depreciation and maintenance costs totaling thousand as well as increases in furniture and equipment depreciation and repairs 
the period reflected decreases in occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses as a result of the sale of two branches in and the closing or consolidation of several branches in computer software depreciation and maintenance costs are expected to increase in future periods as software utilized by the corporation s data processing subsidiary to process loan and deposit accounts is replaced and placed in service during the new application software will enable the subsidiary banks to provide customers with enhanced products and services including internet banking 
technology continues to have a great impact on financial services companies and their ability to compete in the marketplace 
the corporation is committed to providing banking  trust and insurance services through traditional branch and telephone channels in the markets we serve  as well as meeting the changing needs of our customers 
outside data processing expenses were million for compared to million for both and outside data processing expenses are managed by the corporation s data processing subsidiary along with management of internal data processing costs 
outsourced data processing needs are evaluated based on technology  efficiency and cost considerations 
this cost would be expected to be reduced by as southwest bank is converted from an outsourced environment to our internal systems 
included in the period were merger and related charges of million 
merger expenses incurred during the acquisition of southwest national corporation for legal  accounting  printing  filing and other professional services totaled million and were expensed during the fourth quarter of as part of the evaluation of appropriate staffing levels for the first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued corporation after inclusion of southwest  an early retirement plan was offered to employees during the fourth quarter of salary and benefit costs of the early retirement plan in the amount of million are included in merger and other related charges for  as approximately of employees took advantage of this opportunity 
in anticipation of the merger of southwest benefit plans into those of the corporation in the near future  southwest curtailed their postretirement benefit plan during the fourth quarter of an additional accrual adjustment of million related to this curtailment is included in merger and other related charges for additional merger and other related charges of thousand were incurred during to standardize depreciation for southwest to that of the corporation and to write off signs and supplies that become obsolete as a result of the merger 
other operating expenses for were million  an increase of thousand over the million reported for collection and repossession expenses increased thousand for compared to as accelerated collection efforts attempted to reduce nonperforming loan levels and minimize risk of loss in future periods 
fdic expenses increased thousand during  primarily as a result of rate changes implemented when the fdic bank insurance fund and savings and loan insurance fund rates were standardized 
express freight charges for increased thousand compared to partially because of the impact of gasoline prices on carrier providers 
other operating expenses for also included increases in advertising and promotions  charge card interchange  and checkbook printing expenses 
increases in other operating expenses for were partially offset by decreases in other professional fees  postage and printing costs of thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively compared to costs 
other operating expenses for the period included an increase in the write down of mortgage servicing rights in the amount of thousand related to the disposition of bsi 
the disposition of bsi in also resulted in a loss on sale of thousand 
advertising  charge card interchange and telephone expense reflected increases for the period of thousand  thousand  and thousand  respectively compared to the period 
since  telephone expenses have been analyzed and successfully reduced during other professional fees  legal fees and audit and accounting fees decreased for compared to income tax expense was million during representing a decrease of million over the amount of million and compared to million in the corporation s effective tax rate was for compared to for and for the reduction in the corporation s effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased tax free income from municipal loans and bank owned life insurance 
extraordinary items for resulted from a single transaction whereby the corporation incurred a cost of thousand for the prepayment of fhlb term borrowings 
this transaction was executed as part of the corporation s repositioning of its balance sheet to reduce exposure to declining interest rates 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank and may borrow under overnight and term borrowing arrangements 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued liquidity continued increased competition from nonbanking sources such as mutual funds  insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms have required banks to rely more heavily on alternative funding from other borrowings 
many of our competitors have significantly greater resources financial and other than us and may offer certain services that our banks do not provide at this time 
in addition certain of our banks competitors are not subject to the regulation and supervision to which we and our banks are subject  and therefore may have competitive advantages over our banks 
the impact of increased competition for deposits could become more consequential in the future 
the corporation monitors liquidity through regular computations of prescribed liquidity ratios 
the corporation actively manages liquidity within a defined range and has developed liquidity contingency plans  including ensuring availability of alternate funding sources to maintain liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
in addition to the previously described funding sources the corporation s ability to access the capital markets was demonstrated during through the issuance of million of capital securities 
the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer 
deposits increased million in and included an increase of million in core deposits 
non core deposits  which are time deposits in denominations of thousand or more represented of total deposits at december   up from of total deposits at december  non core deposits increased by million in and million due in part to an increase in public funds 
the increase in non core deposits during also included the issuance of brokered time deposits in the amount of million 
although the corporation s primary source of funds remains traditional deposits from within the communities served by its banking subsidiaries  future sources of deposits utilized could include the use of brokered time deposits offered outside the corporation s traditional market area 
time deposits of thousand or more at december   and had remaining maturities as follows maturity distribution of large certificates of deposit dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent remaining maturity months or less    over months through months    over months through months    over months    total    net loans decreased million during as residential real estate loans and loans to individuals decreased by million and million respectively  compared to year end decreases during for consumer loans were partially offset by increases in commercial loans secured by real estate and increases in municipal loans of million and million over the same time period 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued below is a schedule of loans by classification for the five years ended december  loans by classification dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction      real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      net leases      gross loans and leases      unearned income      total loans  and leases net of unearned income      an additional source of liquidity is marketable securities that the corporation holds in its investment portfolio 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of  million and an approximate fair value of  million 
gross unrealized gains were million and gross unrealized losses were million 
based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed to be more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity 
below is a schedule of the contractual maturity distribution of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale at december  maturity distribution of securities held to maturity dollar amounts in thousands states and total weighted us government agencies political other amortized average and corporations subdivisions securities cost yield within year    after but within years     after but within years    after years    total     maturity distribution of securities available for sale at amortized cost dollar amounts in thousands us treasury  and other states and total weighted us government agencies political other amortized average and corporations subdivisions securities cost yield within year    after but within years     after but within years     after years     total     yields are calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued interest sensitivity the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately describe the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps when measured over a variety of time periods may be helpful 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceeds interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the time period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings 
the following table lists the amounts and ratios of assets and liabilities with rates or yields subject to change within the periods indicated as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets   total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings   total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings    total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued although the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest income  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
the income simulation model used by the corporation captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  cash flows from loans  deposits and investments and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  such as interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the corporation s asset liability management policy guidelines limit interest rate risk exposure for the succeeding twelve month period 
simulations are prepared under the base case where interest rates remain flat and most likely case where interest rates are defined using projections of economic factors 
additional simulations are produced estimating the impact on net interest income of a basis point movement upward or downward from the base case scenario 
the corporation s current asset liability management policy indicates that a basis point change in interest rates up or down cannot result in more than a change in net interest income when compared to a base case without board approval and a strategy in place to reduce interest rate risk below the established maximum level 
the analysis at december   indicated that a basis point movement in interest rates in either direction over the next twelve months would not have a significant impact on the corporation s anticipated net interest income over that time and the corporation s position would remain well within current policy guidelines 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for the identification  assessment and management of interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  capital adequacy and investment portfolio position 
the primary objective of the alco process is to ensure that the corporation s balance sheet structure maintains prudent levels of risk within the context of currently known and forecasted economic conditions and to establish strategies which provide the corporation with appropriate compensation for the assumption of those risks 
the alco attempts to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of strategies such as asset disposition  asset and liability pricing and matched maturity funding 
the alco strategies are established by the corporation s senior management and are approved by the corporation s board of directors 
final loan maturities and rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio excluding consumer installment and mortgage loans and before unearned income at december  were as follows dollar amounts in thousands within one one to after year years years total commercial and industrial     financial institutions real estate construction     real estate commercial     other     totals     loans at fixed interest rates   loans at variable interest rates   totals   first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued credit review maintaining a high quality loan portfolio is of great importance to the corporation 
the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established an allowance for credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage  documentation  and terms 
the principal factor used to determine potential borrowers creditworthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral or guarantees  are frequently obtained 
the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committees lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
early in  the corporation initiated an additional level of approval for credit relationships between thousand and million 
this procedure requires approval of those credits by a committee consisting of senior lenders of the corporation 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for operating  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans are expected from the operations of the subject real estate and are carefully analyzed prior to approval 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for each bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property 
residential loan terms are normally established in compliance with secondary market requirements 
residential mortgage portfolio interest rate risk is controlled by secondary market sales  variable interest rate loans and balloon maturities 
loans to individuals represent financing extended to consumers for personal or household purposes  including automobile financing  education  home improvement  and personal expenditures 
these loans are granted in the form of installment  credit card  or revolving credit transactions 
consumer creditworthiness is evaluated on the basis of ability to repay  stability of income sources  and past credit history 
the corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses which are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific allowance for primary watch list classified loans  an allowance based on historical trends  an additional allowance for special circumstances  and an unallocated portion 
the corporation consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology and procedure at the subsidiary bank level 
the allowance for primary watch list classified loans addresses those loans maintained on the corporation s primary watch list which are assigned a rating of substandard  doubtful  or loss 
substandard loans are those with a well defined weakness or a weakness which jeopardizes the repayment of the debt 
a loan may be classified as substandard as a result of impairment of the borrower s financial condition and repayment capacity 
loans for which repayment plans have not been met or collateral equity margins do not protect the corporation may also be classified as substandard 
doubtful loans have the characteristics of substandard loans with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of presently existing facts and conditions  is highly improbable 
although the possibility of loss is extremely high for doubtful loans  the classification of loss is deferred until pending factors  which might improve the loan  have been determined 
loans rated as doubtful in whole or in part are placed in nonaccrual status 
loans which are classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for credit losses at the next meeting of the corporation s credit committee after placement in this category 
there were no loans classified as loss on the primary watch list as of december  loans on the primary watch list may also be impaired loans  which are defined as nonaccrual loans or troubled debt restructurings which are not in compliance with their restructured terms 
each of the classified loans on the primary watch list are individually analyzed to determine the level of the potential loss in the credit under the current circumstances 
the specific reserve established for these criticized and impaired loans is based on careful analysis of the loan s performance  the related collateral value  cash flow considerations and the financial capability of any guarantor 
the allowance for primary watch list classified loans is equal to the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for the individual classified loans on the watch list 
primary watch list loans are managed and monitored by assigned account officers within the corporation in conjunction with senior management 
the allowance based on historical trends uses charge off experience of the corporation to estimate potential unconfirmed losses in the balances of the loan and lease portfolios 
the historical loss experience percentage is first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued based on the charge off history for the twenty most recent quarters 
historical loss experience percentages are applied to all non classified loans to obtain the portion of the allowance for credit losses which is based on historical trends 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances which are subject to guarantee by a government agency 
loan balances are also adjusted for unearned discount on installment loans 
the additional allowance for special circumstances provides management with the opportunity to estimate additional potential allowance amounts which may be needed to cover specific factors 
the specific factors that management currently evaluates consist of portfolio risk or concentrations of credit  off balance sheet risk  economic conditions  management or staff considerations  and comparative peer analysis variances 
portfolio risks include unusual changes or recent trends in specific portfolios such as unexpected changes in the trends or levels of delinquency or charge offs  unusual repossession activities or large levels of unsecured loans in a portfolio 
the corporation also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential credit loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential credit losses is performed these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for credit losses is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
however  for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for credit losses at december according to the categories indicated allocation of the allowance for credit losses dollar amounts in thousands commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      lease financing receivables unallocated      total      allowance as percentage of average total loans other than those described below  there are no material credits that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
renegotiated loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued nonperforming and impaired assets and effect on interest income due to nonaccrual dollar amounts in thousands loans on nonaccrual basis      past due loans      renegotiated loans  total nonperforming loans      nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans allowance as percentage of nonperforming loans other real estate owned      gross income that would have been recorded at original rates  interest that was reflected in income net reduction to interest income due to nonaccrual the reduction of income due to renegotiated loans was less than thousand in any year presented 
the level of nonperforming loans at year end increased by million over levels as increases in past due and renegotiated loans were only partially offset by decreases in nonaccrual loans 
increases for past due loans primarily resulted from increases for commercial loans secured by real estate and commercial and industrial loans of million and million  respectively 
the major portion of these increases relate to small business loans  of which million were guaranteed by the sba 
the corporation continues to aggressively collect these loans 
also  early in the corporation initiated an additional level of approval for credit relationships between thousand and million 
this procedure requires approval of those credits by a committee consisting of senior lenders of the corporation 
the increase in renegotiated loans for compared to was the result of the modification of loan terms for one commercial borrower 
decreases for nonaccrual loans for occurred primarily in commercial loans which reflected decreases of thousand for commercial loans secured by real estate and decreases for commercial and industrial loans of million compared to nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared to at december  the corporation s loan portfolio continues to be monitored by senior management to identify potential portfolio risks and detect potential credit deterioration in the early stages 
credit risk is mitigated through the use of sound underwriting policies and collateral requirements 
management attempts to minimize loan losses by analyzing and modifying collection techniques on a periodic basis 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
capital resources equity capital increased million in to million 
dividends declared decreased equity by million during  an increase over dividends for the period as the dividend rate was increased 
the retained net income of million remained in permanent capital to fund future growth and expansion 
long term debt payments and fair value adjustments to unearned esop shares increased equity capital by thousand 
the market value adjustment to securities available for sale first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued capital resources continued increased equity by million 
amounts paid to fund the discount on reinvested dividends reduced equity by thousand 
the cost of purchasing treasury shares decreased equity by thousand while proceeds from the reissuance of treasury shares to provide for stock options exercised increased equity by thousand during equity capital during also reflected an increase of thousand from the reissuance of treasury shares to fund the buy out of the insurance agency s joint venture partner see note to the consolidated financial statements 
a capital base can be considered adequate when it enables the corporation to intermediate funds responsibly and provide related services while protecting against future uncertainties 
the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
see note for an analysis of regulatory capital guidelines and the corporation s capital ratios relative to these measurement standards 
inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analysis and monitoring of its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
