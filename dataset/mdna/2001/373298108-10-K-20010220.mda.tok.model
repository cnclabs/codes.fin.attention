at december   the corporation had outstanding approximately million net of discount of euro denominated bonds which were designated as a hedge against its net investment in europe 
the use of these derivative financial instruments allows the corporation to reduce its overall exposure to exchange rate movements  since the gains and losses on these contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged

the timber company s target debt level remains at billion

the corporation has operations in seven of the participating countries  including greece  which adopted the euro effective january  and has product sales in ten of the participating countries 
the corporation s european businesses affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the information system issues and the potential business implications of converting to a common currency 
as of december   the corporation s financial information technology systems were capable of processing euro denominated transactions but the euro is not yet the reporting or functional currency for any part of our business 
the corporation believes it will be able to modify the remaining financial systems and business activities to complete the process of conversion and transition to the euro as our functional business currency prior to year end for the countries concerned 
the corporation is unable to determine the financial effect of the conversion on its operations  if any  since such effect depends on the competitive conditions which exist in the various regional markets in which the corporation operates and potential actions which may or may not be taken by the corporation s competitors  customers and suppliers
