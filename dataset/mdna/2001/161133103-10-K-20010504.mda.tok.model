as of november  finance charges on all accounts are billed using a floating rate index the prime lending rate  subject to a floor and limited by legal maximums 
the floating rate index on all of the certificates is either one month libor or the commercial paper rate  depending on the issue 
consequently  the company has reduced its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
however  the company has exposure in the movement of basis risk between the floating rate index on the certificates and the prime rate 
as of february   the floating rate finance charge rate was below the contractual floor rate  thus exposing the company to a portion of interest rate risk 
to the extent that short term interest rates were to increase by one percentage point by the end of fiscal  an increase of approximately thousand in selling  general  and administrative expenses would result
