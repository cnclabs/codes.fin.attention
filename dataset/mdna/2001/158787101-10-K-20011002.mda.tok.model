results of operations overview the company reported a net income of million for the fiscal year ended july   compared to a net income of million last year 
pretax income for fiscal was million after an increase million to reserves for additional anticipated legal and other expenses related to litigation involving predecessor companies that were either spun off or sold prior to fiscal  compared to million last year 
net income also includes a net tax benefit of million resulting from a reassessment of the expected tax benefits the company will realize in fiscal and future years from its net operating loss carryforward 
the company reported a profit from continuing operations of million for fiscal while the company believes its strategies will continue to produce overall profitability  there can be no assurance that such strategies will continue to be successful 
accordingly  the company may again incur operating losses 
to sustain profitability  the company must  among other things  manage  within acceptable parameters  contingencies associated with its former businesses including fuddruckers  its former food service and great bagel and coffee businesses  continue to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales while continuing to increase net revenues from its restaurants and successfully executing its growth strategy for the champps americana concept 
see item business for a discussion of events in fiscal and that  in part  will shape the future direction of the company 
the company s champps americana restaurant chain is in the expansion phase 
the timing of revenues and expenses associated with the opening of new restaurants are expected to result in fluctuations in the company s quarterly and annual results 
in addition  the company s results  and the results of the restaurant industry as a whole  may be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes  discretionary spending priorities  national  regional or local economic conditions  demographic trends  consumer confidence in the economy  traffic patterns  weather conditions  employee availability and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
changes in any of these factors could adversely affect the company 
among other factors  the success of the company s business and its operating results are dependent upon its ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and liquor costs and  particularly for champps americana restaurants  the mix between food and liquor revenues 
various factors beyond the company s control  such as adverse weather changes  may affect food costs and increases in federal  state and local taxes may affect liquor costs 
while in the past  the company has been able to manage its exposure to the risk of increasing food and liquor costs through certain purchasing practices  menu changes and price adjustments  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future or that changes in its sales mix or its overall buying power will not adversely affect the company s results of operations 
notwithstanding these risks  the company believes that its near term strategies  including  but not limited to  continued expansion of champps  improved operational excellence  anticipated continued lower general and administrative expenses from actions taken since june   the effects of the spin off  the fuddruckers sale  the consolidation of corporate headquarters  the sale of non essential assets and businesses  and other related transactions  should provide the opportunity for increased profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures the market risk exposure inherent in the company s financial instruments and consolidated financial position represents the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to such interest rate risk primarily in its significant investment in cash and cash equivalents and the use of fixed and variable rate debt to fund its acquisitions of property and equipment in past years and the implicit interest rates in the company s sale leaseback arrangements 
market risk for cash and cash equivalents and fixed rate borrowings is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the assets or obligations resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in interest rates  which would not have been significant to the company s financial position or results of operations during fiscal the effect of a similar hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt and the investment rates implicit in the company s sale leaseback arrangements also would have been insignificant due to the immaterial amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit arrangements
