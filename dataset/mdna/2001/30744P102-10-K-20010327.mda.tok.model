overview we design  manufacture  sell and support a broad line of products for plastic card personalization and data encoding 
in february  we recapitalized our company pursuant to which a group of investors acquired an interest in fargo 
in connection with this recapitalization  we received million in equity financing and incurred indebtedness of million 
the outstanding shares of common stock held by our founder and sole stockholder were redeemed with million in cash  issuance of million of redeemable preferred stock and the issuance of a million note payable 
this stockholder retained a interest in fargo immediately after the recapitalization 
the transaction was accounted for as a leveraged recapitalization such that our assets and liabilities remain at their historical bases for financial reporting purposes 
for income tax purposes  the transaction was treated as a taxable business combination such that the financial statements reflect a step up in tax basis 
in  non recurring expenses of million were incurred  primarily in the form of cash and stock bonuses to employees  immediately prior to the recapitalization 
as part of the recapitalization we distributed  as a dividend  certain assets and product lines to primera technology  inc  a corporation solely owned by our founder 
the distributed assets were part of separate product lines that we determined were not going to be a part of our future business strategy 
net assets distributed to primera totaled approximately  from january  to february   these product lines distributed represented approximately  in net sales and  in gross profit 
subsequent to the recapitalization  we have focused our business strategy on the design  manufacture and sales of products for plastic card personalization and data encoding 
product lines that are not related to our current strategy are in the process of being discontinued 
these products  excluding product lines distributed to primera technology  inc in the recapitalization  constituted approximately  million  and million in net sales in   and  respectively 
in february  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of  before offering expenses 
we used the proceeds of the offering to repay debt and redeem our redeemable preferred stock 
for more information about the use of proceeds from the offering  see note to our financial statements beginning on page f the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the net sales related to plastic card personalization and encoding card products  and products not related to plastic card personalization non card including non card product lines distributed to primera in the recapitalization years ended december  in thousands card products    non card products   net sales    results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative recapitalization costs total operating expenses operating income comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the mix of net sales continued to change during this period with sales of plastic card personalization products increasing to million in from million in sales of products not related to plastic card personalization decreased to  in from million in of the million in sales attributable to plastic card personalization products in  sales of equipment decreased to million from million in  and sales of supplies increased to million from million in the decrease in sales of equipment was principally due to our inability to meet demand caused from unforeseen engineering and manufacturing difficulties as we ramped up production on our new products 
the increase in sales of supplies was the result of increased volume of units in the field 
international sales increased to million in from million in and accounted for of net sales in compared to of net sales in the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased demand in most geographic markets 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily due to manufacturing start up costs related to our new products  an unfavorable change in the exchange rate on the japanese yen versus the us dollar which increased our purchasing costs  increased discounts and the mix of printers sold 
the yen impacts our gross margin since we purchase our ribbons from japanese suppliers  however  with our new agreement with our japanese supplier to purchase ribbons in dollars  this impact should be limited in we anticipate that our gross profit percentage for the first quarter of will be lower than the first quarter of due to continued manufacturing start up costs on new products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for compared to for the increase in was primarily due to the continued development of our new high definition printing hdp and direct to card dtc product lines and other new plastic card personalization technologies 
research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering salaries and prototype component costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in these increases are principally attributable to increased dealer promotional activities and additional marketing expenses to promote our new products 
operating income 
operating income decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income was in as compared to in interest expense 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in upon completion of the initial public offering of our common stock in february  million of the offering proceeds were used to reduce our outstanding debt 
this reduction in our debt contributed to the lower interest expense  although the decrease was partially offset by higher interest rates 
we also refinanced our then outstanding senior bank debt with a revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was in as compared to in extraordinary loss 
in connection with our initial offering of common stock in february of  we recorded an extraordinary loss  net of tax  of  for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the pay down of senior bank debt 
we also recorded an extraordinary loss  net of tax  of  for the write off of the remaining deferred financing costs related to the origination of the senior bank debt that was paid in full in september of using proceeds from a new revolving credit facility 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in  which results in an effective tax rate of  compared to income tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of in comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the mix of net sales changed significantly during this period with sales of plastic card personalization products increasing to million in from million in sales of products not related to plastic card personalization decreased to million in from million in of the million in sales attributable to plastic card personalization products in  sales of equipment increased to million from million in  and sales of supplies increased to million from million in international sales increased to million in from million in and accounted for of net sales in compared to of net sales in gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable exchange rate on the yen and changes in our discounts and pricing structure  but this was partially offset by overhead efficiencies attributable to being focused solely on products related to plastic card personalization 
the yen impacts our gross profit since we purchase our ribbons from japanese suppliers 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales were for compared to for the increase in was primarily due to the development of our new high definition hdp product line and other new plastic card personalization technologies 
research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering salaries and prototype component costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the dollar increase in was principally attributable to additional marketing promotion expenses 
in addition  we incurred higher professional fees related to updating our internal accounting and manufacturing systems to address year compliance 
operating income 
operating income increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income was in as compared to in the increase in operating income as a percentage of net sales in was principally attributable to the recapitalization costs of million or of net sales recorded in without these recapitalization costs  operating income would have been million or of net sales 
interest expense 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in prior to the recapitalization in february  we had no debt and  therefore  no interest expense 
the weighted average interest rate on our term loan in and was 
the interest rate on the note payable to stockholder was for and income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in which results in an effective tax rate of 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate is primarily due to state income taxes 
income tax expense for was million 
prior to the recapitalization in february  we had elected s corporation status and  therefore  the periods prior to february  do not reflect income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations  debt service and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
working capital was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
our current ratio was   and at december    and  respectively 
cash generated from operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million and non cash charges of million for deferred income taxes  extraordinary items  depreciation and amortization and the provision for obsolete inventories 
these cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventories of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to the timing of sales and the increase in inventory resulted primarily from inventory purchased to support new product introductions 
cash used by investing activities was million primarily for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash used in financing activities was million primarily due to our initial public offering of common stock and payment on our notes payable bank and our revolving credit facility 
cash generated by operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million and non cash charges of million for deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
the cash generated from operations also included increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
these cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  and an increase in inventory of million 
in  we used million for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash flows from investing activities during were primarily for the repayment on notes payable to our bank of million and  for payments of deferred offering costs 
at december   our borrowings consisted of million owed under the revolving credit agreement with lasalle bank and harris bank 
in  the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 
we anticipate that  as of march   we will not be in compliance with certain financial covenants in our existing credit agreement 
we are currently negotiating with our banks and we have signed a non binding term sheet containing the terms upon which we expect to amend the agreement in a manner that we believe will result in a satisfactory outcome 
if we are unable to amend the agreement on the terms outlined in the term sheet  the adverse consequences could include the revolving credit facility immediately terminating  and the loans and all other obligations becoming immediately due and payable  the inability to borrow at the libor rate  and the annual interest increasing by 
we believe that funds generated from operations and funds available to us under our revolving credit facility agreement will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
recently issued accounting standards the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  in december the sab summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed a comprehensive review of our revenue recognition policies and determined that they are in compliance with sab in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we must adopt this standard no later than january  we have reviewed the requirements of this standard and expect that this standard will not affect our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
interest rate risk under procedures and controls established by management  we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to hedge our exposure to interest rate risks 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions 
although we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties  this exposure is managed through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures and  to the extent possible  by restricting the period over which unpaid balances are allowed to accumulate 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by counterparties to these contracts  and no material loss would be expected from such nonperformance 
we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed  floating and variable rate debt 
to help manage borrowing costs  we may enter into interest rate swaps 
under these arrangements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
we had no interest rate derivatives outstanding at december  the fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding at december   was not material 
a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates  upon which these contracts are based  would not cause these instruments to have a material impact on future earnings 
foreign currency risk we denominate all foreign sales in us dollars and make purchases from a material supplier using foreign currency and do not hedge against currency fluctuations 
we purchase components and supplies from several japanese suppliers 
the strengthening of the yen versus the us dollar in caused the cost of these supplies to increase 
to date  currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition  but could in the future by causing our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of foreign manufactures or by causing the costs of our material supplies to increase 
with the implementation of the agreement we made in february of with our supplier to purchase dye sublimation ribbons in dollars rather than in yen  we believe that we have reduced the risks of increased purchasing costs that would otherwise occur if the dollar weakens relative to the yen 
we have foregone the opportunity  however  to benefit from the full potential cost savings if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen 
equity price risk we do not generally invest in marketable equity securities 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  comprising approximately of our total assets 
accordingly  a sustained decrease in the rate of interest earned would not have a material adverse effect on our business
