item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general dynamic materials corporation dmc or the company is a worldwide leader in explosive metalworking and  through its aerospace group  is involved in a variety of metal forming  machining  welding  and assembly activities 
the explosive metalworking business includes the use of explosives to perform metallurgical bonding  or metal cladding and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
the company performs metal cladding using its proprietary technologies 
the company s revenues from its explosive metalworking businesses  as a proportion of total company revenues  have declined in the past two years as a result a significant slowdown in global market demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate and the acquisitions of amk welding  spin forge and precision machined products 
the company s aerospace group was formed from these three acquisitions and accounted for  and of the company s  and revenues  respectively 
explosive metalworking 
clad metal products are used in manufacturing processes or environments that involve highly corrosive chemicals  high temperatures and or high pressure conditions 
for example  the company fabricates clad metal tube sheets for heat exchangers 
heat exchangers are used in a variety of high temperature  high pressure  highly corrosive chemical processes  such as processing crude oil in the petrochemical industry and processing chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic fibers 
in addition  the company has produced titanium clad plates used in the fabrication of metal autoclaves to replace autoclaves made of brick and lead for two customers in the mining industry 
the company believes that its clad metal products are an economical  high performance alternative to the use of solid corrosion resistant alloys 
in addition to clad metal products  the explosive metalworking business includes shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
aerospace manufacturing 
products manufactured by the aerospace group are typically made from sheet metal and forgings that are subsequently machined or formed into precise  three dimensional shapes that are held to tight tolerances 
metal machining and forming is accomplished through traditional technologies  including spinning  machining  rolling and hydraulic expansion 
dmc also performs welding services utilizing a variety of manual and automatic welding techniques that include electron beam and gas tungsten arc welding processes 
the company s forming and welding operations are often performed to support the manufacture of completed assemblies and sub assemblies required by its customers 
fabrication and assembly services are performed utilizing the company s close tolerance machining  forming  welding  inspection and other special service capabilities 
the company s forming  machining  welding and assembly operations serve a variety of product applications in the commercial aircraft  aerospace  defense and power generation industries 
product applications include tactical missile motor cases  titanium pressure tanks for launch vehicles  and complex  high precision component parts for satellites 
the company completed three separate business acquisitions during on january   the company acquired certain assets of amk welding  inc amk 
amk supplies commercial aircraft and aerospace related automatic and manual  gas tungsten and arc welding services 
on march   the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of spin forge  llc spin forge 
the company s management believes spin forge is one of the country s leading manufacturers of tactical missile motor cases and titanium pressure vessels for the commercial aerospace and defense industries 
on december   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of precision machined products  inc pmp 
pmp is a contract machining shop specializing in high precision  high quality  complex machined parts used in the aerospace  satellite and high technology industries 
on march   the company announced that it has reached agreement to acquire of the stock of nobleclad europe sa nobleclad and nitro metall aktiebolag nitro metall from nobel explosifs france nef 
nobelclad and nitro metall operate cladding businesses located in rivesaltes  france and likenas  sweden  respectively  which generated combined revenues of approximately million in calendar year nef is wholly owned by groupe snpe and is a sister company to snpe  inc  which owns of the company s common stock 
the acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of the purchase price of approximately million will be financed through a million intercompany note agreement between the company and snpe  inc and the assumption of approximately million in third party bank debt associated with nobleclad s planned acquisition of nitro metall from nef prior to the company s purchase of nobleclad stock 
on january   the board of directors of dmc declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on january   the rights record date  to the stockholders of record on that date 
each right entitled the registered holder to purchase from dmc one one hundredth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock  par value 
per share  of dmc at a purchase price of  subject to adjustment 
the rights were redeemed by the company at a redemption price of 
per right on june  due largely to the operating loss the company incurred during  the company violated certain financial covenants under its debt agreements beginning with the quarter ended september  once it became apparent that financial covenant violations under its debt agreements would continue  the company began to evaluate various business strategies and financing alternatives in connection with the need to restructure its debt agreements and or re capitalize the company s balance sheet 
these efforts culminated in the company entering into a stock purchase agreement the agreement with snpe  inc snpe that was signed on january  and subsequently approved by the company s stockholders on june  the closing of the transaction  which was held immediately following stockholder approval  resulted in a payment from snpe of  to the company in exchange for  of the company s common stock at a price of per share causing snpe to become a stockholder of the company on the closing date 
the company also borrowed  on june  under a new credit facility with snpe 
the snpe credit facility  which bears interest at the federal funds rate plus  may be increased to a maximum of  in total borrowings subject to certain approvals by snpe 
proceeds from the snpe equity investment  convertible subordinated note issuance and credit facility borrowings enabled the company to repay all borrowings from its bank under a revolving credit facility on which the company had been in default since september  in  the company experienced significant operating losses as a result of a significant decline in sales revenue and gross margin levels within its aerospace group 
the company s explosive metalworking group generated a small operating income in after incurring significant operating losses in the company also experienced  and expects to continue to experience  quarterly fluctuations in operating results caused by various factors  including the timing and size of orders from major customers  customer inventory levels  shifts in product mix  the occurrence of acquisition and divestiture related costs  and general economic conditions 
the company typically does not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from its customers 
quarterly sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs 
if sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall 
in addition  the company uses numerous suppliers of alloys  steels and other materials for its operations 
the company typically bears a short term risk of alloy  steel and other component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross profit margins 
although the company will work with customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of any component shortages  component shortages have had  and are expected from time to time to have  short term adverse effects on the company s business 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for decreased to  from  in the company s aerospace group contributed  to sales of total sales sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
this decrease of  or  reflects a  decline in sales at spin forge that is attributable to a major customer deferring shipments on a long term production contract from to the latter part of and decreased sales under certain missile motor case programs 
the sales decrease that the aerospace group experienced in is expected to reverse itself in sales by the explosive metalworking group  whose operations include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  decreased from  in of total sales to  in of total sales 
the small decrease reflects the continued effects of a significant  cyclical slowdown in global market demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate that continued from through the year strong booking activity during the early part of supports the company s belief that the global market demand for clad metal products is improving 
gross profit 
despite the decrease in the company s net sales  gross profit for increased by to  from  in the company s gross profit margin for was  a increase from the gross profit margin of in the gross profit margin for the company s explosion metalworking group increased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the aerospace group decreased to in from in the large increase in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to significant reductions in fixed manufacturing overhead costs resulting from the july closing of the group s colorado manufacturing facility and the consolidation of all of the group s manufacturing activities in its new mount braddock  pennsylvania plant 
price increases during the last half of the year also contributed to the explosive metalworking group s improved gross margin performance 
the significant decline in the gross margin rate for the aerospace group reflects a large decrease in sales at spin forge and a decrease in gross margin levels at precision machined products and amk welding due to product mix changes and higher operating expenses 
the weak financial performance of the aerospace group is being addressed through expanded sales and marketing programs  organizational changes at all three divisions and the implementation of new production control and scheduling systems 
the company believes that these changes should enable the group to return to profitability before the end of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in this increased percentage is largely attributable to the decrease in the company s sales during general and administrative expenses in included  of non recurring severance pay 
selling expense 
selling expenses increased by to  in from  in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses increased from in to in year selling expenses included  of non recurring expenses associated with severance pay and other employee separation costs within the explosive metalworking group sales department 
excluding non recurring employee separation costs  selling expenses decreased by  or from to start up costs 
in the third quarter of  the company began to separately report the start up costs associated with the construction of a new facility in pennsylvania for the manufacture of clad metal plates 
these start up costs included salaries  benefits and travel expenses for company employees assigned to this project  field office expenses and other operating expenses directly associated with this construction project 
the new facility commenced operations in august at which time all operating costs associated with this new facility began to be recorded as manufacturing overhead that is included in the computation of cost of products sold 
start up costs in totaled  plant closing costs 
on april   the company announced that it would be closing its louisville  colorado based explosion bonded clad metal plate manufacturing facility in the third quarter of and consolidating all of its explosive metalworking group operations into the new pennsylvania based clad metal plate manufacturing facility 
for the year ended december   the company recorded non recurring charges of  related to costs associated with this plant closing 
no additional plant closing costs were incurred subsequent to december  plant closing costs include severance pay to terminated employees  outplacement service fees and certain expenses incurred in connection with final plant shutdown  clean up and site reclamation work subsequent to the discontinuation of manufacturing activities at this facility in july 
impairment of long lived assets 
in connection with the plant closing discussed above  the company identified certain long lived assets associated with its colorado manufacturing operations that were to be abandoned and that had negligible fair market values 
accordingly  the company recorded asset impairment write down charges in the aggregate amount of  during the company also identified certain inventory that was determined to have little value as a result of the plant closing 
this inventory  which totaled approximately  was consequently written off in as a charge to cost of products sold 
costs related to attempted asset disposition 
on june   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell certain assets relating to its explosive metalworking group to ametek for approximately million 
however  on october   ametek notified the company that it was terminating the asset purchase agreement 
in connection with the company s efforts during to sell its explosive metalworking group  the company recorded non recurring expenses of  these expenses related principally to investment banking  legal and other third party fees associated with the terminated ametek transaction 
income loss from operations 
the company reported a  loss from operations in compared to a loss from operations of  in the  year to year decrease in the company s loss from operations reflects a significant improvement in operating results for the explosive metalworking group that was partially offset by the first ever operating loss for the aerospace group 
the explosive metalworking group reported income from operations of  in  as compared to a loss from operations of  in that included  of non recurring expenses associated with new facility start up costs  plant closing costs and asset impairment write downs 
excluding these non recurring expenses  the explosive metalworking group operating results showed a year to year improvement of  on sales that were essentially unchanged from to these improved results reflect an increase in gross margins from in to in  resulting from fixed manufacturing cost savings in associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in and stronger selling prices during the second half of the company s aerospace group reported a loss from operations of  in  as compared to income from operations of  in this unfavorable variance is attributable to the large decline in year to year sales at spin forge and reduced gross profit levels at precision machined products and amk welding 
the weak financial performance of the aerospace group is being addressed through expanded sales and marketing programs  organizational changes at all three divisions and the implementation of new production control and scheduling systems 
the company believes that these changes should enable the group to return to profitability before the end of interest expense 
interest expense increased by to  in from  in this increase is attributable to interest expense under the company s industrial development revenue bonds that were used to finance the new clad metal plate manufacturing facility in pennsylvania 
interest expense on the bonds was capitalized during the construction period  which ended on august   and expensed thereafter as the facility became operational 
the increase in bond interest expense was partly offset by a decrease in interest on other outstanding debt that resulted from the reduction in revolving credit debt that was made possible by the equity invested in the company by snpe  inc on june  income tax benefit 
the company recorded no income tax benefit in and an income tax benefit of  in the company was able to carry back a major portion of its loss to prior years in which the company generated taxable income and recognize a tax benefit associated with these loss carry backs 
however  the tax loss exceeded the amount of federal tax that could carried back to the and tax years and the company did not recognize a tax benefit with respect to the portion of the tax loss that can be carried forward 
additionally  the tax loss could not be carried back for state tax purposes 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the effective tax benefit rate of in was significantly lower than the company s effective tax rate of in again in  the company did not record a tax benefit associated with the tax loss that can be carried forward since the future realization of the tax benefits associated with the tax loss carry forwards remains uncertain as of the date of the december  financial statements 
extraordinary item loss from extinguishment of debt 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with its bank related to the bank lines of credit 
the company terminated this swap agreement in the third quarter of resulting in a deferred gain of  that was being amortized over the terms of the acquisition line of credit 
once the bank lines of credit were extinguished as part of the snpe transaction  the unamortized deferred gain of  was offset against the unamortized deferred finance charges of  related to the lines of credit and recorded as an extraordinary loss of extinguishment 
net income loss 
the company recorded a net loss of  in as compared a net loss of  in the  decrease in the company s net loss is much lower than the decreased operating loss from to would suggest due to the recognition of  in tax benefits in versus the recognition of no tax benefit in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for decreased to  from  in the company s new aerospace group  which was formed in as a result of the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp  contributed  to sales of total sales sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
this increase in aerospace group sales is largely due to the december  acquisition of pmp whose results are included in aerospace group sales for all of but only one month of the increase in aerospace group sales was more than offset by a  decline in sales by the company s explosion metalworking group 
sales by this group  whose operations include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  decreased from  in of total sales to  in of total sales 
the large decrease in explosive metalworking group sales reflects a significant slowdown in global market demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate that is expected to continue for the year gross profit 
as a result of the sharp decline in the company s net sales  gross profit for decreased by to  from  in the company s gross profit margin for was  a decline from the gross profit margin of in gross profit margin for the company s explosion metalworking group decreased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the aerospace group decreased to from in the large decrease in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to unfavorable fixed manufacturing overhead cost variances associated with the sharp declines in production and sales of clad plates 
fixed manufacturing overhead costs for the explosive metalworking group have been significantly reduced through the july closing of the group s colorado manufacturing facility and consolidation of all of the group s manufacturing activities in its new mount braddock  pennsylvania plant 
the decline in the gross margin rate for the aerospace group reflects a decrease in year to year sales at spin forge and related unfavorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses into cost of products sold 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase includes a  increase in direct aerospace group general and administrative expenses 
the increase in direct general and administrative expenses of the aerospace group relates to the timing of the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp that were completed on january  march and december   respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in this increased percentage is largely attributable to the significant decrease in sales by the explosive metalworking group 
selling expense 
selling expenses decreased by to  in from  in this decrease reflects lower expense levels in a number of categories  including compensation and benefits  advertising and promotion  reserves for bad debts and travel and entertainment expenses 
compensation and benefit expense decreases are associated with reduced staffing levels in response to the decline in demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate 
however  due to the decrease in sales  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased slightly from in to in start up costs 
in the third quarter of  the company began to separately report the start up costs associated with the construction of a new facility in pennsylvania for the manufacture of clad metal plates 
start up costs increased from  in to  in these start up costs included salaries  benefits and travel expenses for company employees assigned to this project  field office expenses and other operating expenses directly associated with this construction project 
the new facility commenced operations in august at which time all operating costs associated with this new facility began to be recorded as manufacturing overhead that is included in the computation of cost of products sold 
plant closing costs 
on april   the company announced that it would be closing its louisville  colorado based explosion bonded clad metal plate manufacturing facility in the third quarter of and consolidating all of its explosive metalworking group operations into the new pennsylvania based clad metal plate manufacturing facility 
for the year ended december   the company recorded non recurring charges of  related to costs associated with this plant closing 
plant closing costs include severance pay to terminated employees  outplacement service fees and certain expenses incurred in connection with final plant shutdown  clean up and site reclamation work subsequent to the discontinuation of manufacturing activities at this facility in july 
impairment of long lived assets

in connection with the company s efforts during to sell its explosive metalworking group  the company recorded non recurring expenses of  these expenses related principally to investment banking  legal and other third party fees associated with the terminated ametek transaction 
income loss from operations 
the company reported a  loss from operations in compared to income from operations of  in the operating loss is a result of the decrease in net sales discussed above and non recurring charges in the aggregate amount of  associated with plant closing costs  new facility start up costs  asset impairment write downs and expenses incurred in connection with efforts to sell the explosive metalworking group 
the company s aerospace group reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in  with this decrease being largely attributable to unfavorable product mix changes that resulted decreased gross margin levels 
the explosive metalworking group reported a loss from operations of  in  including  of non recurring expenses associated with new facility start up costs  plant closing costs and asset impairment write downs  as compared to income from operations of  in non recurring corporate costs in the amount of  that were incurred in connection with the attempted sale of the explosive metalworking group were not allocated to either of the company s two business segments in computing the above business segment income loss from operations amounts for interest expense 
interest expense increased by to  in from  in this large increase is attributable to borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit with the company s bank that were required to finance the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp and that were outstanding for a full year in and to interest expense under the company s industrial development revenue bonds that were used to finance the new clad metal plate manufacturing facility in pennsylvania 
interest expense on the bonds was capitalized during the construction period  which ended on august   and expensed thereafter as the facility became operational 
income tax provision 
due to losses before income taxes and the ability to carry back the major portion of these losses to prior years in which the company generated taxable income  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in as compared to a tax provision of  in the effective tax rates for recording the tax benefit and the tax provision were and  respectively 
the tax loss exceeded the amount of federal tax that can be carried back to the and tax years and the company did not recognize a tax benefit with respect to the portion of the tax loss that can be carried forward 
additionally  the tax loss cannot be carried back for state tax purposes 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the effective tax benefit rate for was significantly lower than the company s effective tax rate for net income loss 
the company recorded a net loss of  in as compared to net income of  in the significant decrease in net earnings was primarily attributable to decreased gross profit from the company s explosion metalworking group  non recurring expenses in the aggregate amount of  associated with plant closing costs  new facility start up costs  asset impairment write downs and expenses incurred in connection with efforts to sell the explosive metalworking group and increased interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has obtained most of its operational financing from a combination of operating activities and an asset backed revolving credit facility 
due primarily to the operating losses the company incurred during and the first quarter of  the company violated certain financial covenants under both the revolving credit facility that was then in effect and the reimbursement agreement related to the letter of credit supporting payment of principal and interest under the company s industrial revenue development bonds the bonds used to finance the construction of its manufacturing facilities in pennsylvania 
on june  the company s stockholders approved a stock purchase agreement the agreement between the company and snpe  inc snpe 
the closing of the transaction  which was held immediately following stockholder approval  resulted in a payment from snpe of  to the company in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share causing snpe to become a stockholder of the company on the closing date 
an additional  cash payment was made by snpe to the company to purchase a five year  convertible subordinated note that is convertible in whole or in part into common stock by snpe at a conversion price of per share 
the company also borrowed  on june  under a new credit facility with snpe that bears interest at the federal funds rate plus and may be increased to a maximum of  in total borrowings subject to certain approvals by snpe 
proceeds from the snpe equity investment  convertible subordinated note issuance and credit facility borrowings aggregated  and enabled the company to repay all outstanding borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility on which the company had been in default since september  the bank revolving credit facility was terminated on june  as a result of the snpe debt and equity infusion  the company was also able to restructure financial covenants under the reimbursement agreement with its bank relating to the industrial development revenue bonds and is currently in full compliance with all provisions of its debt agreements 
the three year bank letter of credit that supports the company s industrial development revenue bonds expires in september company management believes that the company will be able to obtain a replacement letter of credit arrangement on terms similar to those of the existing letter of credit and underlying reimbursement agreement 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and funds available under its credit facility with snpe  or a replacement credit facility with a third party financial institution  will be sufficient to fund working capital  debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements of its current business operations for the foreseeable future 
snpe has agreed to extend its credit facility  which is currently callable upon days notice and had an original maturity date of june   to march  management of the company intends to replace the snpe credit facility with a new third party credit facility during the last half of or the early part of and believes that the company s strengthened balance sheet and improving operating results will enable the company to secure such third party financing on reasonable terms 
until the company is able to secure such third party financing on reasonable terms  it will continue to rely on the financial support of snpe 
company management believes that it will be able to negotiate an increase in the snpe credit facility during if the company s working capital requirements increase as a result of the anticipated sales growth during the year 
a significant portion of the company s sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to perform existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect the company s ability to meet its cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
consequently  any restriction on the availability of borrowing under the snpe credit facility or a replacement facility could negatively affect the company s ability to meet its future cash requirements 
highlights from the statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  which consisted primarily of a net loss of  that was largely offset by depreciation and amortization expense of  and positive net changes in various components of working capital 
sources of cash flow from working capital included a  reduction in income tax receivable and a  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these positive changes in working capital were largely offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of  and  respectively 
net cash flow from investing activities for the year ended december  was  significant sources of cash flow from investing activities included  in proceeds from the sales of property  plant and equipment   from the repayment of a loan to a related party   from the release of bond proceeds and  from other changes in noncurrent assets 
these sources were partially offset by capital expenditures of  including  of expenditures on the new manufacturing facility in pennsylvania 
financing activities for the year ended december  used  of cash 
significant sources of cash flow from financing activities included net proceeds in the aggregate amount of  from the snpe transaction that closed on june  sources of cash flow from the snpe transaction were more than offset by the repayment of  in bank line of credit borrowings and  of industrial development revenue bond principal payments
