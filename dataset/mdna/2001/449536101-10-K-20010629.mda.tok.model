item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of our proprietary technologies  primarily the origen r technology for the clinical diagnostic  life science and industrial markets 
we currently derive a majority of our revenue from royalties received from licensees that develop and market certain origen based systems 
we also generate sales of our own products  particularly the m series tm system and related consumable reagents 
we may selectively pursue additional strategic alliances  which could result in additional license fees or contract revenues 
since inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development  manufacturing scale up and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
as a result  we will need to generate higher revenue to achieve profitability 
results of operations years ended march  and revenues 
total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by approximately million or to million from million in fiscal the revenue growth for fiscal was due to increases in all revenue categories product sales  royalty income and contract fees 
product sales were million in fiscal  an increase of over the prior year s product sales of million 
this growth in product sales was led by the m series line of instrumentation and consumable products  as well as  the revenue generated from the sale of clinical diagnostic assays to physician office laboratory pol customers in the united states 
we began serving these pol customers in june when roche transferred the customers in order to comply with a court ordered preliminary injunction 
also contributing to the growth in product sales were shipments under distribution agreements that we signed during the fiscal year with sanko junyaku co  ltd 
and sumitomo corporation 
royalty income was million in fiscal  an increase of over the prior year s royalty income of million 
royalties from roche represent approximately million of the total royalty income for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal roche launched its elecsys product line in  which is based on our origen technology that was licensed to roche under a license agreement 
we are involved in litigation with roche arising out of this agreement 
one of the disputes in the litigation relates to the computation of royalties to which we believe we are entitled to under the agreement 
see item  legal proceedings 
contract revenue in the current fiscal year increased to million from  last year 
this increase is attributable to our alliance with bayer diagnostics bayer under which the two companies are exploring new products for the hospital point of care testing market 
operating costs and expenses 
product costs were million of product sales for fiscal compared to million of product sales for fiscal the change in product cost margins is attributable to a change in product sales mix between lower margin m series instruments and the higher margin m series consumable reagents  as well as m series retrofit costs and pol sales 
research and development costs increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this increase was due to ongoing development expenses primarily associated with enhancements to the m series system and related assays  development of additional instrumentation  including new assays  for the m series line of products to meet the expanding needs of the drug discovery and development market  development associated with designing hospital point of care products  and research and development expenses associated with the meso scale diagnostics msd joint venture 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million over the prior year s total of million 
this increase was due primarily to higher sales and marketing costs related to expanding the launch of the m series system throughout the united states  europe and japan 
costs related to our litigation with roche increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to expanded activities in several areas  such as work related to a court appointed special master s examination of roche s books and records  preparation and presentation of several motions  including motions for summary judgment  preparation for and participation in a trial in delaware in february  and preparation for a trial in maryland scheduled for october the increased litigation costs also include financial and legal advisors fees associated with settlement discussions 
interest and other expense 
interest expense  net of other income  excluding a non recurring charge in  increased million in fiscal due to interest on higher debt balances during the year and a full year s amortization of the detachable warrant value associated with the convertible debentures issued in january in fiscal  we also recorded a non cash charge of million related to the beneficial conversion element of the convertible debentures and related warrants 
the convertible debentures have a one time beneficial conversion feature measured as the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of our common stock at the time of the issuance of debentures 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf release no 
 application of eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities and beneficial conversion features 
this standard established new guidelines for convertible securities and beneficial conversion features 
the change in methods resulted in a one time  non cash charge that was recorded during the year as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
prior year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting 
the effect of the change on our statement of operations for the year ended march  was to increase the net loss by million per share 
net loss 
excluding the non recurring  non cash charge of million per share taken for the cumulative effect of accounting change  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends in fiscal including this charge  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends 
in fiscal  including the non cash charge  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends 
excluding the non cash charge of million per share taken to account for the beneficial conversion element of the convertible debentures and related warrants issued january  the net loss was million per share  after consideration of the effect of preferred dividends 
results of operations in the future are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors  which include the volume and timing of orders for m series or other products  the timing of instrument deliveries and installations  variations in revenue recognized from royalties and other contract revenues  the mix of products sold  whether instruments are sold to or placed with customers  the timing of the introduction of new products  competitors introduction of new products  variations in expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the business  including legal fees  research and development costs and sales and marketing costs  manufacturing capabilities  and the volume and timing of product returns and warranty claims 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since inception and expect those losses to continue 
losses have resulted from a combination of lower royalty revenue than we believe we are entitled to under license agreement with roche  costs incurred in research and development  roche litigation costs  selling costs and other general and administrative costs 
we expect to incur additional operating losses as a result of increases in expenses for manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  research and product development and general and administrative costs 
our ability to become profitable in the future will depend  among other things  on our ability to expand the commercialization of existing products  introduce new products into the market  develop marketing capabilities cost effectively  and develop sales and distribution capabilities cost effectively  complete new business arrangements  and resolve the litigation with roche 
as of march   we had net operating loss and general business credit tax carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
our ability to utilize net operating loss and general business credit tax carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue service code of  as amended

in addition  we have received funds from collaborative research and licensing agreements  sales of our origen line of products and royalties from product sales by licensees 
during february  we entered into an agreement with aqua wellington north american equities fund llc acqua for an equity financing facility covering the sale of up to million of our common stock over the subsequent months 
under this facility  we have sold  shares to acqua for million through march  all shares of common stock sold and to be sold to acqua will be issued under our shelf registration statement covering up to million shares of common stock 
we will control the amount and timing of additional stock sales that may be made under the terms of this agreement

cash used in operations was million  million and million during the years ended march   and  respectively 
these increases in cash used were due primarily to higher operating losses incurred during each period 
we used approximately million  million  and million of cash for the acquisition of equipment and leasehold improvements during the years ended march   and  respectively 
additionally  during fiscal year  we incurred capital lease obligations of approximately  related to acquisition of equipment 
we believe material commitments for capital expenditures may be required in a variety of areas  such as product development programs 
we have not  at this time  made commitments for any such capital expenditure or secured additional sources to fund such commitments 
for fiscal  future minimum lease payments for which we are obligated under capital lease agreements approximate  including interest while facility and equipment operating lease commitments approximate million 
during  the company established meso scale diagnostics  llc msd  a joint venture company formed for the development and commercialization of products utilizing a proprietary combination of multi array technology together with origen and other technologies owned by the company 
the joint venture was initially scheduled to expire in november with extensions through april at which time mst extended the term of the joint venture for up to days under an automatic extension provision in the joint venture agreement 
the company  through an independent committee of its board of directors  is currently negotiating with mst the terms under which the msd joint venture may be continued 
although we have not committed to any specific level or term for further funding of the joint venture  we are presently funding msd s ongoing research  development and capital equipment costs  as well as certain patent costs of mst  while the independent committee is negotiating with mst the terms under which the joint venture may be continued 
a new agreement may require us to make future capital contributions  which could be substantial 
due to the complexities of the issues  negotiations and agreements involved there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement to continue the joint venture will be reached 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  and there is a possibility that we may be unable to generate cash or arrange financing sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due with respect to indebtedness when due  or in the event any of it is accelerated 
in addition  our indebtedness may require that we dedicate a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
we need substantial amounts of money to fund operations 
in this regard  we have ongoing discussions with third parties  including multinational corporations  regarding various business arrangements including distribution  marketing  research and development  joint venture and other business agreements  which could provide for substantial up front fees or payments 
further  we are considering and evaluating the advisability and feasibility of a variety of financing alternatives  including issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any of the foregoing arrangements and access to funds could be adversely impacted by many factors  including the results of pending litigation  the volatility of the price of our common stock  continuing losses from operations and other factors 
the company believes that existing capital resources  together with revenue from product sales  royalties and contract fees will be adequate to fund operations through fiscal year if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may have to scale back  or even eliminate  some programs 
alternatively  we may have to consider pursing arrangements with other companies  such as granting licenses or entering into joint ventures  on terms and conditions that may not be favorable to us 
we are actively engaged with roche in settlement discussions with respect to a resolution of the litigations between the parties on mutually agreeable terms 
there can be no assurance as to when  or if  the parties will reach resolution of these matters  or that such resolutions will be on favorable terms and conditions 
we have no reason to believe that the existence of the roche litigation is having a material adverse effect on roche s sales pursuant to the agreement or that a negative result for us in the roche litigation would have a material adverse effect on roche s sales  although there can be no assurance that the litigation or its outcome would not have such an effect 
as it now stands  roche has the right to continue to market its elecsys products to central hospital laboratories and clinical reference laboratories during the term of the agreement unless and until we are determined to have the right to terminate the agreement and then determine to terminate the agreement 
if we elect to terminate the agreement  it would have a material adverse effect on our royalty revenue from license sales unless and until we entered into a strategic partnership with another company that is able to develop and commercialize diagnostic instruments for central hospital laboratories and clinical reference laboratories 
there can be no assurance  if we decided to terminate the agreement that we would be able to enter into such a strategic partnership on terms favorable to us  if at all 
we do not expect that failure to prevail in the hitachi litigation see item legal proceedings by itself would have a material adverse effect on our revenue or sales  because hitachi would continue to manufacture roche instruments and we would continue to earn royalties in connection with roche sales 
there can be no assurance that the hitachi litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property  regardless of whether the outcome of the litigation is favorable or not 
success by us in the hitachi litigation could have a material adverse effect on our royalty revenues from sales of elecsys products to the extent that roche s sales of elecsys instruments are hindered because it needs to find a new manufacturer for its instruments or make arrangements to have hitachi manufacture the instruments outside of japan
