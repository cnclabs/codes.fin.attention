year risks the company experienced no significant year compliance issues and year issues did not have a material effect on its business  results of operations  or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s revolving credit facility with wells fargo is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor plus  at the company s option 
the line of credit expires on march  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  the company s cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that the company would be required to pay more interest in the event that both the prime and libor interest rates increase 
management does not  however  believe that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on the company s interest expense or available cash 
the company currently maintains a zero balance on the revolving credit facility 
even if the company were to draw down on the line prior to its expiration and an unpredicted increase in both alternated rates occurred  it would not be likely to have a material effect on the company s interest expense or available cash 
sensitivity analysis 
assuming the company had a million balance outstanding as of october   the rate of interest calculated using the prime rate option would be 
the company s monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose to  which assumes an unusually large increase  the company s monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or  given the recent trend of decreasing or relatively low interest rates  would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively 
the company does not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material or that the payment required would have a material effect on cash flow
