the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operation of the company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
general investment climate over the course of the reporting year  we witnessed a pronounced contraction in both the public and private equity markets 
the public technology sector was hit particularly hard as it became clear to investors that the irrational exuberance which reached its peak in early had created considerably over inflated valuations for technology stocks 
the resulting correction  which began in the second quarter of  continued its downward drift through the third quarter of as corporate profits sank  business activity slowed  and the availability of capital quickly dried up 
just as the technology sector had spearheaded the boom of the late s  its deterioration significantly contributed to the erosion of the overall economy 
the declining demand from businesses and consumers for new products and services resulted in grossly overstocked inventories and an overcrowded technology market 
despite the fed s aggressive attempts to dampen the effects of an inevitable consolidation  as well as president bush s supportive tax cuts  the economy continued to skid into what is now recognized as a mild recession 
the private technology market  though typically more insulated from systematic market risk  was clearly not immune to the public market and economic downturn 
the difficult environment in which private technology companies continued to operate was reflected by the fund writing down the value of a number of its investments during the reporting period  primarily those companies funded in notwithstanding the reduced valuations  the fund continued to finance and support its existing portfolio companies  focusing extensive efforts on those that it feels will weather the storm and emerge leaner  stronger  and poised to take advantage of improved market conditions 
with respect to the fund s current investment environment  the deflated market capitalizations of public technology companies and the lack of ipo and profitable merger and acquisition opportunities presented so far this year have created conditions that we believe may significantly benefit shareholders in the long run 
the reduced valuations of private information technology companies are considerably more reasonable  and the liquidation preferences and anti dilution provisions that the fund is able to negotiate into the terms of each new deal have improved substantially 
in addition  a large number of venture capitalists have been spending a majority of their time supporting existing portfolio companies 
this decreased competition for new deals has allowed liquid venture capital funds  such as ours  more time to diligently research and scrupulously invest in new companies 
looking forward  although corporate earnings for technology companies will likely continue to reflect diminished business activity in the near term  we believe that much of the correction in this sector  as well as for the overall economy  has already been absorbed 
furthermore  it is likely that the fed s continuing monetary stimulus  as well as the fiscal response to the events of september  will provide a strong foundation for economic recovery 
with a significant cash position remaining to be invested  and an existing portfolio containing promising young companies  we feel that the fund is in an excellent position to generate strong  long term gains for shareholders as information technology once again becomes a driving force behind a return to economic growth 
liquidity and capital resources at october   the fund had  of its net assets the value of total assets less total liabilities of  invested in portfolio companies of companies and  of its net assets invested in temporary investments consisting of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  money market funds  and us government and agency securities 
current balance sheet resources are believed to be sufficient to finance any future commitments 
net cash used for operating activities was  for the year ended october  net investment income and net realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments are intended to be distributed at least annually 
management believes that its cash reserves and the ability to sell its temporary investments in publicly traded securities are adequate to provide payment for any expenses and contingencies of the fund 
the fund reserves the right to retain net long term capital gains in excess of net short term capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses 
such retained amounts  if any  will be taxable to the fund as long term capital gains  and shareholders will be able to claim their proportionate share of the federal income taxes paid by the fund on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities 
shareholders will also be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their tax credit
