results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of worldwide sales and service fees and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income license fee income and litigation settlement fees  net interest expense net income fiscal compared with fiscal net income for the fiscal year ended october  was million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or 
per share  for the preceding year 
fiscal net income was due almost entirely to the receipt in the fourth quarter of proceeds from a settlement of a long standing patent infringement claim 
operating results for fiscal  however  compared unfavorably to those for the prior year  due to the substantial adverse impact of converting foreign sales and costs  particularly those denominated in euros  to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
had exchange rates in fiscal remained the same as the average rate in effect during fiscal  income before taxes for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
sales and service fees were million for fiscal  an increase of from the million reported for fiscal when measured at constant exchange rates  however  net sales and service fees would have been approximately million for the fiscal year  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales and service fees was primarily driven by an increase in sales of computerized machine systems 
sales of computerized machine systems totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
domestic sales of computerized machine systems in fiscal increased by million  or  due primarily to a increase in units shipped 
shipments of computerized machine systems in europe also increased by 
shipments of computerized machine systems in southeast asia also benefited from significantly improved market conditions 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  approximated of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal new order bookings for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
orders for computerized machine systems increased million reflecting a increase in unit orders 
unit orders for machine systems in the us increased over fiscal as a result of a very strong fourth quarter  which reflected favorable acceptance of our new products introduced at the biennial international manufacturing technology show imts in september  along with improved market conditions 
outside of the united states  orders for machine systems increased due principally to increased market penetration in continental europe and southeast asia 
orders in southeast asia also benefited from significantly improved market conditions 
backlog was million at october   compared to million at the end of fiscal gross profit margin  as a percentage of sales  declined in fiscal to from in fiscal  due primarily to the unfavorable effects of the stronger us dollar particularly in relationship to the euro 
the unfavorable effect was most pronounced in the fourth fiscal quarter 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to product development costs associated with the our new line of computerized machine systems as well as costs associated with expanded sales and marketing activities 
the increased operating expenses  combined with the adverse margin impact of the strong us dollar  resulted in a decrease in operating profit from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of  for severance costs related to the termination of employees at our subsidiary  autocon technologies  inc in connection with the completion of the consolidation of this operation into our north american sales and service business 
interest expense for fiscal declined by  or  from the level in fiscal  primarily due to the significant reduction in our outstanding borrowings 
other expense was  in fiscal compared to other income of  in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of realized and unrealized currency losses associated with accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  primarily those linked to the euro  which for the most part  were not hedged during fiscal the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal is primarily related to the earnings of a foreign subsidiary as well as to the settlement of a previously disclosed german tax issue for approximately  domestic net operating loss carryforwards were substantially utilized in fiscal we would have recorded an additional tax provision of approximately million in fiscal without the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains more information with respect to our net operating loss carryforwards 
fiscal compared with fiscal net income for the fiscal year ending october  was million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share  for the preceding year 
results for fiscal are not comparable to the preceding period because fiscal results include a million restructuring charge and million of license fees and litigation settlements net of expenses and foreign withholding taxes 
as discussed below  net license fee income and litigation settlements fees for fiscal were  sales and service fees were million for fiscal  a decrease of from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in sales was due in part to the negative impact converting foreign sales to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
at constant exchange rates  net sales and service fees for fiscal would have been million 
sales of computerized machine systems  before foreign currency translation effects were substantially unchanged from the prior year and accounted for of our annual sales and service fees 
domestic sales of computerized machine systems in fiscal decreased by million  or  reflecting very weak market conditions that have existed since the third quarter of fiscal sales of computerized machine systems in europe increased million  or  in fiscal on a constant dollar basis  while sales in southeast asia increased million 
the increase in international sales was offset in part by approximately million negative effect from foreign currency translation 
sales of stand alone cnc systems and software declined by million  or 
the decline in stand alone cnc systems was primarily the result of an anticipated reduction in shipments to original equipment manufacturers and retrofit dealers of stand alone cnc systems  primarily related to our deltatm series cnc systems  as we have repositioned these products as components of integrated machine systems 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  increased to approximately of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal orders for were million compared to million in the prior year  a million  or  decrease 
computerized machine system orders increased million  or  while stand alone cnc system orders decreased million  or 
computerized machine system unit orders in europe increased while orders in the united states declined 
offsetting the increase in computerized machine system orders in europe was a decline in stand alone cnc system unit orders of 
the decline in orders for stand alone cnc systems is the result of our repositioning these products for marketing as components of integrated computerized machine systems 
backlog was million at october  and million at october  gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of lower service margin and the effects of a stronger dollar relative to foreign currencies 
interest expense for fiscal increased  or from the amount reported for the corresponding period in fiscal  primarily due to increased borrowing to support an increase in finished product inventory which began in the second half of fiscal license fee income and litigation settlement fees for fiscal were  compared to million in the prior year 
as previously reported  there are a limited number of cnc users that are not already licensed 
as a result  license fee income and litigation settlement fees in fiscal were not expected to equal that recorded in fiscal note to the consolidated financial statements contains more information on license fee income and litigation settlement fees 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal is primarily related to the earnings of a foreign subsidiary which no longer has the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the fiscal provision was favorably impacted by a  tax asset recorded by a foreign subsidiary due to a change in its tax status 
the provision for foreign income taxes in fiscal consisted of  of foreign withholding taxes resulting from license fee income and litigation settlement fees and approximately million related to the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
net operating loss carryforwards available to offset pre tax income in future periods are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
euro currency many of the countries in which we sell our products and services are member states of the economic and monetary union emu 
beginning january   member states of the emu were permitted to begin trading in either their local currencies or the euro  the official currency of emu participating member states 
parties are free to choose the unit they prefer in contractual relationships during the transitional period  beginning january and ending june our computer system contains the functionality to process transactions in either a country s national currency or the euro 
we have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any material adverse effects on our operations related to the emu s conversion to the euro 
however  there can be no assurance that the conversion of emu member states to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
foreign currency risk management we manage our foreign currency exposure through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
we also moderate our currency risk related to significant purchase commitments with certain foreign vendors through price adjustment agreements that provide for a sharing of  or otherwise limit  the risk of currency fluctuations on the costs of purchased products 
note to the consolidated financial statements has more information on this subject 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash provided by operations totaled million in fiscal  compared to cash used by operations of  in fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was enhanced by litigation settlement receipts of approximately million  net of legal fees and taxes 
working capital  excluding short term debt was million at october   compared to million at october  the decline in working capital is attributable to a decrease in inventory of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in inventory relates primarily to an increase in sales combined with a planned reduction in inventory of finished products available for shipment 
the increase in accounts payable is the result of increased machine purchases from our contract manufacturers in the fourth fiscal quarter under terms that generally range from to days 
capital investments for the fiscal consisted principally of expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock during fiscal under our previously announced stock repurchase program 
these shares are reflected as a reduction of common stock outstanding in calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share 
total debt at october  was million  representing of total capitalization  compared to million  or  of total capitalization at october  on december   we purchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million from a related party  brynwood partners ii lp the purchased shares will be reflected as a reduction in common stock 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants at october  we believe that cash flow generated from our future operations and borrowings available to us under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in the foreseeable future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our bank line of credit is affected by the general level of us and european interest rates and or libor 
we had  outstanding under our bank line of credit at october  and the effect of interest rate changes will likely not be significant 
foreign currency exchange risk a significant portion of our product content is sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by contract manufacturers overseas 
our contractual arrangements with those suppliers typically include foreign currency risk sharing agreements which reduce the effects of currency fluctuations on product cost 
the predominant portion of foreign currency exchange rate risk regarding product cost relates to the new taiwan dollar 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from foreign markets 
all computerized machine systems  cnc systems and certain proprietary service parts are sourced by a central engineering and manufacturing division of our us company and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
the us company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to inter company sales  inter company purchases  inter company accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies
