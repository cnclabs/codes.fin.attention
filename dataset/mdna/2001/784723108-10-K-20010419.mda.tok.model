item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we provide professional internet data security services and develop and market software and microprocessor based products needed to secure electronic commerce and communications over the internet and other communications networks based on internet protocols 
our primary technology offerings use pki  which is the standard technology for securing internet based commerce and communications 
in addition  pulsar  a wholly owned subsidiary  is an established computer and networking product reseller that focuses on resales to government agencies  large corporate accounts and state and local governments 
we acquired pulsar in june in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
before  we were solely a provider of electronic interconnect products to government and commercial entities 
in  we formed our data security division  which is the basis of our operations today 
the data security division was engaged primarily in research and development until when it began to generate meaningful revenue 
in september  we sold our intercon division  which consisted of the assets relating to our interconnect operations  for cash to allied signal inc  a non related  publicly traded company 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and because we acquired pulsar in june  for the fiscal year ended december   our revenue and expenses include the results of pulsar s operations since june  therefore  revenue and expenses are not comparable from period to period 
total revenue 
total revenue increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  and increased from million during to million during the year ended december  the increase from to consisted of million of network solutions market revenue generated by pulsar subsequent to the acquisition  a decrease of million in information security products and services revenue  and an increase of million in research and development revenue 
the increase from to consisted of a million increase in network solutions market revenue primarily attributable to a full year of sales in as compared to a partial year in  a million increase in information security products and services revenue primarily attributable to an increase in sales of existing data security products and services  and a million decrease in research and development revenue attributable to the completion in of the contract that was responsible for generating research and development revenue 
during   and of revenue was generated from sales to lockheed martin corporation  the national security agency and the us army corps of engineers  respectively 
during  and of revenue was generated from sales to the united states immigration and naturalization service and the united states department of state  respectively

product revenue 
product revenue increased from million during to million during and increased from to million during the increase from to consisted of million of network deployment product revenue generated by pulsar subsequent to the acquisition and a decrease of million in data security product revenue 
the increase from to consisted of a million increase in network deployment products revenue and a million increase in data security products revenue 
license and service revenue 
license and service revenue increased from million during to million during and increased from million during to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to service revenues of  associated with the electric security systems ess product line that was acquired as part of the pulsar acquisition 
the ess product line did not fit into either of our primary business segments and in july we discontinued the ess product line 
we did not incur any significant expenses and we do not believe there will be any material impact on future results of operations as a result of our decision to discontinue the ess product line 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase of  related to an ongoing government support contract that began in august and to the recognition of  of revenue  out of a total of  contract  that requires us to provide customer support for three years 
the balance of this  contract has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized over the remainder of the support period 
research and development revenue 
research and development revenue represents amounts earned under a contract with the national security agency nsa for the design of a microprocessor meeting minimum specifications established by the nsa 
we have contracted with others to perform aspects of the project 
all related project costs were expensed as research and development was incurred 
regardless of the results of the development efforts  the amounts received from the nsa are nonrefundable 
the related research and development costs were not separately identifiable 
therefore  the corresponding costs of the entire development effort were included in research and development expenses 
research and development revenue increased from  during to  during the increase from to was primarily attributable to a greater portion of total contract revenues being earned in than were earned in the contract that resulted in research and development revenue was completed in and no further research and development revenue is currently anticipated under this contract 
product gross margin 
product gross margin decreased as a percentage of net product revenue from during to during and increased to during the decrease from to was primarily attributable to the mix of low margin versus high margin products sold during during network deployment products represented of product revenue as compared to data security products that represented of product revenue 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to the proportionately higher increase in revenue related to data security products as compared to network deployment products 
during network deployment products represented of product revenue as compared to data security products that represented of product revenue 
margins from the sale of data security products are significantly greater than the margins from the sale of network deployment products 
license and service gross margin 
license and service gross margin increased as a percentage of license and service revenue from during to during and increased to during the increase from to was primarily attributable to the company s ability to reduce the underutilized labor cost that had resulted in lower gross margins in the prior year 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to discontinuing the ess product line 
gross margins associated with the ess product line were significantly less than the gross margins associated with data security services 
the ess product line was discontinued in july selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million during to million during and increased from to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to the additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with pulsar 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to twelve months of pulsar related selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to approximately six months in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from during to during and increased to during the percentage decrease from to was primarily attributable to the revenues generated by pulsar during and the percentage increase from to was primarily attributable to selling  general and administrative expenses increasing at a rate slightly higher than the rate of increase in revenues due to lower sales than planned 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million during to million during and increased from to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to significant increased staffing related to product development  including development efforts related to the forte microprocessor  maestro  profile manager  netsign and token reader writers 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to continued significant staffing increases related to those same projects that were responsible for the staffing increases in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased from during to during and increased to during the percentage decrease from to was primarily attributable to the revenues generated by pulsar 
the percentage increase from to was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of our research and development efforts increasing at a rate of while revenues increased at a rate of 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
in june  we acquired pulsar 
all of the outstanding shares of pulsar were exchanged for  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in the fourth quarter we determined the integration of pulsar would not be completed as planned and the anticipated operating synergies would not be realized  therefore  we are currently exploring various alternatives for the pulsar operations 
as a result  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company has analyzed the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangibles relating to the acquisition of pulsar 
in order to evaluate the recoverability of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets  the company engaged the services of an independent valuation firm to perform a valuation 
based on the results of the independent valuation  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to unamortized intangible assets acquired in the purchase of pulsar 
based on the independent valuation  management believes that after the impairment charge of million  no further impairment exists at december  the remaining unamortized intangible assets of  acquired in the purchase of pulsar will be amortized over the remainder of their year life 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles recorded during was attributable to the acquisition of pulsar 
the amortization recorded during the year ended december  of million relates to the period june  through december  the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased from million during to million during the increase is primarily attributable to a full year of amortization expense related to unamortized intangible assets in compared to six months during when the company acquired pulsar 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased from  during to  during and decreased from to  during the decrease from to was primarily attributable to the reduction in interest expense that resulted when proceeds from our initial public offering were used to extinguish outstanding debt obligations 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of  and a reduction in interest expense of income taxes 
for the income tax benefit of  was primarily attributable to losses from continuing operations before income taxes of million 
for the income tax benefit of  was primarily attributable to prior year tax refunds received that exceeded amounts recorded as receivable in prior years 
for the income tax expense of  was primarily attributable to minimum california franchise taxes 
backlog 
at december   and total backlog was   and million  respectively 
orders are subject to cancellation in certain circumstances  and backlog may therefore not be indicative of future operating results 
the increase in the backlog at december   was attributable to an increase of  related to data security products and  related to network deployment products 
the backlog of data security products at december   consisted primarily of unfilled orders for the argus materials required to assemble the argus were not received until january once the necessary materials were received  the argus readers were assembled and shipped during the first quarter of the backlog of network deployment products at december   was the result of orders that were received too close to the end of the year to be shipped before the end of the year 
liquidity and capital resources in june  we completed our initial public offering of common stock 
the net proceeds of the offering were million 
in june we also entered into a three year lending agreement with guaranty business credit corporation gbcc permitting borrowings under a million secured revolving line of credit facility that commenced on june  the agreement provided for an annual interest rate of prime plus  and a pledge of substantially all of our personal and real property as collateral 
although the credit facility was for borrowings up to million  under the terms of the agreement the amount of borrowing available to the company was subject to a maximum borrowing limitation based on eligible collateral 
eligible collateral consisted of of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of a of the value of eligible on hand inventory or b million 
as a result  the amount that was actually available to the company at any particular time may have been significantly less than the full million credit facility due to the maximum borrowing limitation calculation 
the agreement with our lender included a number of covenants and restrictions that we were required to adhere to 
these covenants and restrictions included maintenance of minimum levels of working capital  tangible net worth  and profitability 
in addition  the agreement did not allow us to pay dividends 
our borrowings related to this agreement are included in current installments of long term debt in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the maximum borrowing limitation based on our eligible collateral was million 
however  at december  we were not in compliance with the covenant related to net quarterly profits for the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of we requested and received a waiver for this violation 
we amended the gbcc revolving line of credit facility effective march  under the terms of the amended agreement  the maximum borrowings are million 
the amended agreement provides for an annual interest rate of prime plus  and a pledge of substantially all of our personal and real property as collateral 
although the credit facility is for borrowings up to million  under the terms of the agreement the amount of borrowing available to the company is subject to a maximum borrowing limitation based on eligible collateral 
eligible collateral consists of of eligible accounts receivable 
as a result  the amount actually available to us at any particular time may be less than the full million credit facility due to the maximum borrowing limitation calculation 
the amended agreement with our lender includes a number of covenants and restrictions that we are required to adhere to 
these covenants and restrictions include maintenance of minimum levels of working capital  tangible net worth  and profitability 
in addition  the amended agreement does not allow us to pay dividends 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of march  during the twelve months ended december   cash used in operations was million primarily attributable to a net loss of million  which included an impairment charge of million related to unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets 
the net loss was primarily offset by the million noncash impairment charge of goodwill and other intangibles  million of noncash depreciation and amortization and a reduction in accounts receivable of million 
during the twelve months ended december  cash used in operations was million primarily due to a net loss of million  an increase of million in accounts receivable  a decrease of million in accounts payable and a decrease of million in accrued liabilities 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of noncash depreciation and amortization 
the amount of cash used in operating activities was million less in as compared to the reduction in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in the net loss of million that included a non cash impairment charge of million  an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  a net decrease in net accounts receivable of million  a net increase in accounts payable of million  and a net increase in deferred revenue of million 
during the twelve months ended december   cash used in investing activities was  versus  in the reduction was the result of  of cash related to our revolving line of credit that was restricted in and was subsequently unrestricted in  and an increase in capital expenditures of  in as compared to during the twelve months ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million versus million in the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of borrowings of million under bank and other borrowing agreements 
these borrowings were offset by repayments of million under bank and other borrowing agreements 
the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of net proceeds from the initial public offering of million  and borrowings of million under bank and other borrowing agreements 
these were partially offset by repayments of million under bank and other borrowing agreements 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and the current availability under our amended million revolving line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
our amended million revolving line of credit facility contains various covenants and restrictions including those noted above 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants  and has obtained a waiver of these covenants 
if we do not maintain our amended million revolving line of credit  or receive waivers for future covenant violations  we may seek additional capital from one or more of the following sources company merger in february  we signed a term sheet with biz interactive zone  inc biz relating to our proposed merger 
we will be the surviving entity after the proposed merger is complete and will be renamed ssp solutions  inc we anticipate that the combined entity will be in a more favorable position to access capital markets 
if the merger is not completed in a timely manner or not at all  we may seek additional capital on terms less favorable than if the merger were completed in a timely manner 
additional equity capital we may seek additional equity capital 
equity capital  if available  may be issued at a discount to market resulting in dilution to current stockholders 
in addition  providers of new equity capital may require additional concessions in order for them to provide needed capital to the company 
we plan to begin shipping our new cypherservers in mid our operating forecast assumes the cypherserver product launch goes as planned and anticipated sales of the cypherservers are realized 
if the product launch is delayed or if the anticipated cypherserver sales are not realized  it will be necessary for us to reduce expenses 
expense reductions would include  but not be limited to  staffing reductions and reductions in other operating expenses as necessary 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors including  but not limited  to the market acceptance of our products and services the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch new products and services and attain a competitive position in the market place research and development plans levels of inventory and accounts receivable technological advances competitors responses to our products and services relationships with partners  suppliers and customers our projected capital expenditures the proposed merger with biz and successful integration in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  hedging activities  and exposure definition 
sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers the effective date of sfas to all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
although we continue to review the effect of the implementation of sfas and sfas  we do not currently believe their adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in results of operations  and do not believe adoption will result in significant changes to our financial risk management practices 
business environment and risk factors the anticipated benefits of our proposed merger with biz may not be realized in february  we signed a term sheet with biz relating to our proposed merger 
even though we expect that our merger with biz will result in mutual benefits  those benefits may not be realized due to a number of factors if the merger is not completed in a timely manner or not at all  we may seek additional capital on terms less favorable than if the merger were completed in a timely manner 
the anticipated management and operational synergies of the proposed merger may not be realized 
the anticipated increase in sales resulting from the combined efforts and combined distribution channels may not be realized 
potential adverse short term effects on operating results  primarily as a result of increased costs resulting from the integration of the operation of the two companies may adversely affect our earnings 
difficulties in creating and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies may adversely affect the operations of the two companies 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of biz after the merger  our business  financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include the length of our customer commitments patterns of information technology spending by customers the timing  size  mix and customer acceptance of our product and service product offerings and those of our competitors the timing and magnitude of required capital expenditures the need to use outside contractors to complete some assignments an increase in our future capital requirements could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations 
future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
if our future capital requirements increase significantly  we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the market acceptance of our products and services the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch new products and services and attain a competitive position in the market place research and development plans levels of inventory and accounts receivable technological advances competitors responses to our products and services relationships with partners  suppliers and customers our projected capital expenditures the proposed merger with biz if we do need to raise additional capital it may be on terms that are unfavorable to us and may result in dilution to current shareholders 
if we unable to raise additional capital to fund our operations  it may be necessary for us to restructure our business operations or implement other cost cutting measures 
such a plan to cut costs may improve our cash flow but it may also inhibit our growth as we may not have the personnel and resources to implement our business strategies and expand our operations 
we have a history of losses and may incur future losses 
we may not become profitable or significantly increase our revenue 
we incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a default under our secured credit arrangements could result in a foreclosure of our assets by our creditors 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure portions of our debt 
this means that if we default on our secured debt obligations  our indebtedness could become immediately due and payable and the lenders could foreclose on our assets 
from time to time  we have been in violation of financial covenants under our existing credit arrangements and have had to negotiate with our lenders for waivers or forbearance agreements for these violations 
although we have received waivers in the past  we may not be able to obtain waivers of continuing  or future covenant violations 
the terms of our loan agreements could limit our ability to implement our business strategy 
the terms of our loan agreements with our credit providers could limit our ability to implement our strategy 
in addition to substantially prohibiting us from incurring additional indebtedness  our loan agreements with these creditors limit  or prohibit  us from the following unless we first obtain their consent declaring or paying cash dividends making capital distributions or other payments to stockholders merging or consolidating with another corporation selling all or substantially all of our assets we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of customers and  therefore  the loss of even one of these customers could significantly and negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue and many of our contracts with our significant customers are short term contracts 
the nonrenewal of any significant contract upon expiration  or a substantial reduction in sales to any of our significant customers  would adversely affect our business unless we were able to replace the revenue we received from these customers 
during the year ended december   we derived of our consolidated revenue from one customer 
doing business with the us government entails many risks  which could adversely affect us 
sales to us government agencies accounted for of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  our sales to these agencies are subject to risks  including early termination of our contracts  disallowance of costs upon audit  and the necessity to participate in competitive bidding and proposal processes  which is costly  time consuming and may result in unprofitable contracts 
in addition  the government may be in a position to obtain greater rights with respect to our intellectual property than we would grant to other entities 
government agencies also have the power  based on financial difficulties or investigations of its contractors  to deem contractors unsuitable for new contract awards 
because we engage in the government contracting business  we have been and will be subject to audits and may be subject to investigation by governmental entities 
failure to comply with the terms of any of our governmental contracts could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties  as well as our suspension from future government contracts for a significant period of time  any of which could adversely affect our business 
if use of the internet and other communications networks based on internet protocols does not continue to grow  demand for our products may not increase 
increased demand for our products depends in large part on the continued growth of the internet and internet protocol based networks and the widespread acceptance and use of these mediums for electronic commerce and communications 
because electronic commerce and communications over these networks are evolving  we cannot predict the size of the market and its sustainable growth rate 
a number of factors may affect market size and growth rate  including the use of electronic commerce and communications may not increase  or may increase more slowly than we expect  the internet infrastructure and communications services to support electronic commerce may not be able to continue to support the demands placed on it by continued growth  and the growth and reliability of electronic commerce and communications could be harmed by delays in development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or by increased governmental regulation 
if pki technology is compromised  our business would be adversely affected 
many of our products are based on pki technology 
the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user s private key  which depends in part on the application of algorithms  or advanced mathematical factoring equations 
the occurrence of any of the following could result in a decline in demand for our data security products any significant advance in techniques for attacking pki systems  including the development of an easy factoring method or faster  more powerful computers publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of private keys government regulation limiting the use  scope or strength of pki our inability to find alternative suppliers of components may adversely affect our business 
some of the components incorporated into our products are produced by other vendors 
we currently purchase some of these components from a single supplier  thus presenting a risk that they may not be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future or at all 
our inability to develop alternative sources  if necessary  may require us to redesign certain products which could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could adversely affect our business 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our products and service offerings could become obsolete 
if we are unable to modify existing products and develop new products that are responsive to changing technology and standards and meet customer needs in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be adversely affected 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technology  emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our products obsolete or less marketable 
the process of developing our products and services is extremely complex and requires significant continuing development efforts 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic relationships  our ability to develop and market our products would be adversely affected 
the loss of any of our existing strategic relationships  or the inability to create new strategic relationships in the future  could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
we depend upon our partners to develop and market products and to fund and perform their obligations as contemplated by our agreements with them 
we do not control the time and resources devoted by our partners to these activities 
these relationships may not continue or may require us to spend significant financial  personnel and administrative resources from time to time 
we may not have the resources available to satisfy our commitments  which may adversely affect our strategic relationships 
further  our products and services may compete with the products and services of our strategic partners 
this competition may adversely affect our relationships with our strategic partners  which could adversely affect our business 
we depend on key management personnel 
our success will depend largely on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
our business may be adversely affected if the services of any of our key personnel become unavailable to us 
there is a risk that these individuals will not continue to serve for any particular period of time 
while we have obtained a key person life insurance policy on the life of our current chief executive officer in the amount of million  this amount may not be sufficient to offset the loss of his service 
there is significant competition in our industry for highly skilled employees and our failure to attract and retain technical personnel would adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to successfully attract or retain highly skilled employees 
our inability to hire or retain highly qualified individuals may impede our ability to develop  install  implement and service our software and hardware systems  customers and potential customers or efficiently conduct our operations  all of which may adversely affect our business 
the data security and networking solution industries are characterized by a high level of employee mobility  and the market for highly qualified individuals in the computer related fields is intense 
this competition means there are fewer highly qualified employees available to hire and the costs of hiring and retaining these individuals are high 
even if we are able to hire these individuals  we may be unable to retain them 
furthermore  there is increasing pressure to provide technical employees with stock options and other equity interests  which may dilute earnings per share 
potential product defects could subject us to claims from customers 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or result in failures when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite our product testing efforts and testing by current and potential customers  it is possible that errors will be found in new products or enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments 
the occurrence of product defects or errors could result in adverse publicity  delay in product introduction  diversion of resources to remedy defects  loss of or a delay in market acceptance or claims by customers against us  or could cause us to incur additional costs  any of which could adversely affect our business 
we may be exposed to potential liability for actual or perceived failure to provide required products or services 
because our customers rely on our products for critical security applications  we may be exposed to potential liability claims for damage caused to an enterprise as a result of an actual or perceived failure of our products 
an actual or perceived breach of enterprise network or data security systems of one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products or solutions  could adversely affect our business reputation 
furthermore  our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations in the performance of our services  or to do so in the time frame required by the customer  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  could result in a claim for substantial damages against us by the customer discourage customers from engaging us for these services damage our business reputation in addition  as a professional services provider  a portion of our business involves employing people and placing them in the workplace of other businesses 
therefore  we are also exposed to liability for actions taken by our employees while on assignment 
we face intense competition from a number of sources 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and  as a result  we face significant competition from a number of different sources 
we may be unable to compete successfully as many of our competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
in addition  there are several smaller and start up companies with which we compete from time to time 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of consolidation in the information security technology and product reseller industries 
third parties could obtain access to our proprietary information or independently develop similar technologies because of the limited protection for our intellectual property 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
notwithstanding the precautions we take  third parties may copy or obtain and use our proprietary technologies  ideas  know how and other proprietary information without authorization or independently develop technologies similar or superior to our technologies 
in addition  the confidentiality and non competition agreements between us and our employees  distributors  and clients may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
policing unauthorized use of our technologies and other intellectual property is difficult  particularly because the global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other data transmitted 
furthermore  the laws of other jurisdictions may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
we may face claims of infringement of proprietary rights 
there is a risk that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in addition  whether or not our products infringe on proprietary rights of third parties  infringement or invalidity claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us and we could incur significant expense in defending them 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may be required to modify our products or seek licenses for these intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to modify our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
our failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
our efforts to expand international operations are subject to a number of risks 
we are currently seeking to increase our international sales 
our inability to maintain or to obtain federal or foreign regulatory approvals relating to the import or export of our products on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to expand our international business 
additionally  our international operations could be subject to a number of risks  any of which could adversely affect our future international sales  including increased collection risks trade restrictions export duties and tariffs uncertain political  regulatory and economic developments inability to protect our intellectual property rights our ability to produce the forte pki card on a timely and cost effective basis depends on the availability of a computer chip from a third party supplier  with whom we do not expect to maintain a supply agreement 
any inability to receive adequate supplies of atmel corporation s specially designed forte microprocessor would adversely affect our ability to complete and sell the forte pki card 
we do not anticipate maintaining a supply agreement with atmel corporation for the forte microprocessor 
if atmel were unable to deliver the forte microprocessor for a lengthy period of time or terminated its relationship with us  we would be unable to produce the forte pki card until we could design a replacement computer chip for the forte microprocessor 
we anticipate this would take substantial time and resources to complete 
a small number of stockholders  including our officers and directors  will have the ability to control stockholder votes 
kris shah and members of his family presently beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would have the ability to elect our directors and to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how other stockholders may vote 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
there is a lawsuit pending against pulsar  that could adversely affect our business if it is resolved against pulsar 
a lawsuit is pending against pulsar that  if resolved against pulsar  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
see item legal proceedings 
our stock price is extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock is highly volatile as a result of factors specific to us or applicable to our market and industry in general 
these factors include variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors company issued earnings announcements that vary from consensus analyst estimates changes by financial research analysts in their recommendations or estimates of our earnings conditions in the economy in general or in the information technology service sector in particular announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors unfavorable publicity or changes in applicable laws and regulations  or their judicial or administrative interpretations  affecting us or the information technology service sectors in addition  the stock market has recently been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  some companies have been sued by their stockholders 
if we were sued  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may deter a takeover or a change in control or prevent an acquisition not approved by our board of directors  or that may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the number of shares eligible for future sale and the existence of registration rights could depress the market for our common stock 
the possibility that a substantial number of additional shares of common stock may become tradable in the public market in the future may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
the shares that are restricted from trading  pursuant to agreement with the underwriter in our initial public offering  became available for sale in june and over succeeding months 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that sales of these additional securities or the availability of these additional securities for sale will have on the market prices prevailing from time to time 
in addition  the representatives of the underwriters in our initial public offering were also granted registration rights  which commenced in june and provided for the registration under the securities act of the securities issuable upon exercise of the representatives warrants 
the exercise of these rights could result in substantial expense to us 
furthermore  if the representatives exercise their registration rights  they will be unable to make a market in our securities for up to nine days before the initial sales of the warrants until the discontinuation of sales
