item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
such statements reflect the current views of our management with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations  results of operations  growth strategy and liquidity 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph 
part i item business general first financial bankshares  inc  a texas corporation  is a multi bank holding company registered under the bank holding company act of  or bhca 
as such  we are supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or federal reserve board  as well as several other state and federal regulators 
we were formed as a bank holding company in under the original name f m operating company  but our banking operations date back to  when farmers and merchants national bank opened for business in abilene  texas 
by virtue of a series of reorganizations  mergers  and acquisitions since  we now own  through our wholly owned delaware subsidiary  first financial bankshares of delaware  inc  nine banks organized and located in texas 
these nine banks are first national bank of abilene  abilene  texas  hereford state bank  hereford  texas  first national bank  sweetwater  texas  eastland national bank  eastland  texas  first financial bank  national association  cleburne  texas formerly named the first national bank in cleburne  stephenville bank and trust co  stephenville  texas  san angelo national bank  san angelo  texas  weatherford national bank  weatherford  texas  and texas national bank  southlake  texas 
our service centers are located primarily in north central and west texas 
considering the branches and locations of all our subsidiary banks  as of december   we had financial centers across texas  with seven locations in abilene  two locations in cleburne  two locations in stephenville  two locations in san angelo  three locations in weatherford  and one location each in hereford  sweetwater  eastland  southlake  aledo  alvarado  burleson  trophy club  and roby 
first financial bankshares  inc we provide management and technical resources and policy direction to our subsidiary banks  which enables them to improve or expand their banking services while continuing their local activity and identity 
each of our subsidiary banks operates under the day to day management of its own board of directors and officers  with substantial authority in making decisions concerning their own investments  loan policies  interest rates  and service charges 
we provide resources and policy direction in  among other things  the following areas o asset and liability management  o accounting  budgeting  planning and insurance  o capitalization  and o regulatory compliance 
in particular  we assist our subsidiary banks with  among other things  decisions concerning major capital expenditures  employee fringe benefits  including pension plans and group insurance  dividend policies  and appointment of officers and directors and their compensation 
we also perform  through corporate staff groups or by outsourcing to third parties  internal audits and loan reviews of our subsidiary banks 
through first national bank of abilene  we provide advice and specialized services for our banks related to lending  investing  purchasing  advertising  public relations  and computer services 
services offered by our subsidiary banks each of our subsidiary banks is a separate legal entity that operates under the day to day management of its own board of directors and officers 
each of our subsidiary banks provides general commercial banking services  which include accepting and holding checking  savings and time deposits  making loans  automated teller machines  drive in and night deposit services  safe deposit facilities  transmitting funds  and performing other customary commercial banking services 
our subsidiary banks also administer pension plans  profit sharing plans and other employee benefit plans  act as stock transfer agents or stock registrars for corporations  and provide paying agent services

and san angelo national bank have active trust departments 
the trust departments offer a complete range of services to individuals  associations  and corporations 
these services include administering estates  testamentary trusts  various types of living trusts  and agency accounts 
in addition  first national bank of abilene  first financial bank and san angelo national bank provide securities brokerage services through arrangements with various third parties 
competition commercial banking in texas is highly competitive  and because we hold less than of the state s deposits  we represent only a minor segment of the industry 
to succeed in this industry  our management believes that our banks must have the capability to compete in the areas of interest rates paid or charged  scope of services offered  and prices charged for such services 
our subsidiary banks compete in their respective service areas against highly competitive banks  savings and loan associations  small loan companies  credit unions  and brokerage firms  all of which are engaged in providing financial products and services and some of which are larger than our subsidiary banks in terms of capital  resources and personnel 
our business does not depend on any single customer or any few customers  the loss of any one of which would have a materially adverse effect upon our business 
although we have a broad base of customers that are not related to us  our customers also occasionally include our officers and directors  as well as other entities with which we are affiliated 
with our subsidiary banks we may make loans to officers and directors  and entities with which we are affiliated  in the ordinary course of business 
we make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons 
loans to directors  officers and their affiliates are also subject to certain restrictions under federal and state banking laws 
employees with our subsidiary banks we employed approximately full time equivalent employees at march  our management believes that our employee relations have been and will continue to be good 
supervision and regulation both federal and state laws extensively regulate bank holding companies and banks 
these laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder are primarily intended to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  although shareholders are also benefited 
the following information describes particular laws and regulatory provisions relating to bank holding companies and banks 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular laws and regulatory provisions 
a change in any of these laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and the business of our subsidiary banks 
bank holding companies because we are a bank holding company  we are subject to regulation under the bhca and its examination and reporting requirements 
the bhca provides that bank holding companies may not engage in any activities other than banking  managing and controlling banks  furnishing services to a bank that it owns and controls  or engaging in certain activities closely related to banking 
examples of activities that the federal reserve board has determined to be closely related to banking  or to managing or controlling banks  include o the making or acquiring of loans or other extensions of credit  o servicing of loans  o performing certain trust functions  o acting or serving as an investment or financial advisor  o providing certain securities brokerage services as agent for customers  and o providing bookkeeping and data processing services for a bank holding company and its subsidiaries  or subject to certain limited exceptions directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than five percent of any class of voting shares or assets of any company  including a bank  without the prior written approval of the federal reserve board 
the bhca provides that the federal reserve board cannot approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation that may o substantially lessen competition in the banking industry  o create a monopoly in any section of the country  or o be a restraint of trade 
however  the federal reserve board may approve such a transaction if the convenience and needs of the community clearly outweigh any anti competitive effects 
specifically  the federal reserve board would consider  among other factors  the expected benefits to the public greater convenience  increased competition  greater efficiency  etc 
against the risks of possible adverse effects undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  unsound banking practices  etc also  see supervision and regulation capital for discussion of capital requirements of bank holding companies and our support of our subsidiary banks for discussion of support requirements of bank holding companies 
gramm leach bliley act traditionally  the activities of bank holding companies have been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking  as described above 
the gramm leach bliley act  which took effect on march   dismantled many depression era restrictions against affiliation between banking  securities and insurance firms by permitting bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities  so long as certain prudential safeguards are observed 
specifically  bank holding companies may elect to become financial holding companies that may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity 
thus  with the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act  banks  securities firms and insurance companies find it easier to acquire or affiliate with each other and cross sell financial products 
the new act permits a single financial services organization to offer a more complete array of financial products and services than historically was permitted 
the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act was a pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry 
under the new legislation  the federal reserve board serves as the primary umbrella regulator of financial holding companies with supervisory authority over each parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries 
the primary regulator of each subsidiary of a financial holding company will depend on the type of activity conducted by the subsidiary 
for example  broker dealer subsidiaries will be regulated largely by securities regulators and insurance subsidiaries will be regulated largely by insurance authorities 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company under the new statute only if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized  is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
a bank holding company that falls out of compliance with such requirement may be required to cease engaging in certain activities 
any bank holding company that does not elect to become a financial holding company remains subject to the current restrictions of the bank holding company act 
a financial holding company is essentially a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers 
under the gramm leach bliley act  among the activities that will be deemed financial in nature for financial holding companies are  in addition to traditional lending activities  securities underwriting  dealing in or making a market in securities  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency activities  activities which the federal reserve board determines to be closely related to banking  and certain merchant banking activities 
in january  the federal reserve board and the secretary of the treasury promulgated final regulations governing the scope of permissible merchant banking investments which are those made under section k h of the bank holding company act  as amended by the gramm leach bliley act  which authorizes a financial holding company  directly or indirectly as principal or on behalf of one or more persons  to acquire or control any amount of shares  assets or ownership interests of a company or other entity that is engaged in any activity not otherwise authorized for the financial holding company under section of the bank holding company act 
under the regulation  the types of ownership that may be acquired include shares  assets or ownership interests of a company or other entity including debt or equity securities  warrants  options  partnership interests  trust certificates or other instruments representing an ownership interest in a company or entity whether voting or nonvoting 
the merchant banking investments may be made by the financial holding company or any of its subsidiaries  other than a depository institution or subsidiary of a depository institution 
before acquiring or controlling a merchant banking investment  a financial holding company must either be or have a securities affiliate registered under the securities exchange act of or a qualified insurance affiliate 
the regulation places restrictions on the ability of a financial holding company to become involved in the routine management or operation of any of its portfolio companies 
the regulation also provides that a financial holding company may own or control shares  assets and ownership interests pursuant to the merchant banking provisions only for such period of time as to enable the sale or disposition on a reasonable basis consistent with the financial viability of the financial holding company s merchant banking investment activities 
special provisions are also included in the regulation governing the investment by a financial holding company in private equity funds 
the federal reserve board and secretary of treasury have also requested public comment on the issue of whether to add the activities of real estate brokerage and real estate management to the list of permissible activities for financial holding companies and financial subsidiaries of national banks 
we cannot predict whether the proposal will be adopted or the form any final rule might take 
the federal reserve board  the occ  and the fdic have proposed for comment a rule which would establish special minimum regulatory capital requirements for equity investments in non financial companies 
the proposed capital treatment would apply symmetrically to equity investments of banks and bank holding companies and would apply a series of marginal capital charges on covered equity investments that increase with the level of a banking organization s overall exposure to equity investments relative to the organization s tier capital 
after withdrawing an earlier proposal  this is the second proposal the agencies have made of this nature and we cannot predict what final form the regulation may take 
we have not elected to become a financial holding company 
we do not believe that the gramm leach bliley act will have a material adverse effect on our operations in this regard in the near term  but we will continue to analyze the effect of the act on our operations and our competition in the coming years 
our management believes that the gramm leach bliley act will in the long term increase competition in the market for financial services and products 
insurance companies and securities firms  which before the passage of the act were limited in their ability to acquire deposit taking institutions  will find it easier to acquire or charter banks 
conversely  banks  which before the passage of the act were limited in their ability to underwrite securities and insurance products  will find it easier to engage in those activities 
to the extent the gramm leach bliley act permits banks  securities firms and insurance firms to affiliate  the financial services industry may therefore experience further consolidation 
although to date only a very small number of significant mergers between banks and securities firms or banks and insurance firms have been consummated  in the future an increased amount of consolidation could result in a growing number of large financial institutions that could compete aggressively with us by offering a wider variety of financial services than what we and our subsidiary banks currently offer or intend to offer in the future 
banks federal and state laws and regulations that govern banks have the effect of  among other things  regulating the scope of business  investments  cash reserves  the purpose and nature of loans  the maximum interest rate chargeable on loans  the amount of dividends declared  and required capitalization ratios 
national banking associations 
banks that are organized as national banking associations under the national bank act are subject to regulation and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency  or occ 
the occ supervises  regulates and regularly examines the first national bank of abilene  first national bank  sweetwater  first financial bank  national association  eastland national bank  san angelo national bank  weatherford national bank and texas national bank 
the occ s supervision and regulation of banks is primarily intended to protect the interests of depositors 
the national bank act o requires each national banking association to maintain reserves against deposits  o restricts the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged  and o restricts investments and other activities 
state banks 
banks that are organized as state banks under texas law are subject to regulation and examination by the banking commissioner of the state of texas 
the commissioner regulates and supervises  and the texas banking department regularly examines  hereford state bank and stephenville bank and trust co 
the commissioner s supervision and regulation of banks is primarily designed to protect the interests of depositors 
texas law o requires each state bank to maintain reserves against deposits  o restricts the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged  and o restricts investments and other activities 
see supervision and regulation payment of dividends for discussion of restrictions on a bank s ability to pay dividends and supervision and regulation capital for a discussion of capital requirements of our subsidiary banks 
deposit insurance each of our subsidiary banks is a member of the fdic 
the fdic provides deposit insurance protection that covers all deposit accounts in fdic insured depository institutions and generally does not exceed  per depositor 
our subsidiary banks must pay assessments to the fdic under a risk based assessment system for federal deposit insurance protection 
fdic insured depository institutions that are members of the bank insurance fund pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification 
institutions assigned to higher risk classifications ie  institutions that pose a greater risk of loss to their respective deposit insurance funds pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk 
an institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to bank regulators 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments to cover the costs of borrowings from the us treasury  the federal financing bank and the bank insurance fund member banks 
as of december   the assessment rate for each of our subsidiary banks is at the lowest level risk based premium available 
under the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of  or firrea  an fdic insured depository institution can be held liable for any losses incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of one of its fdic insured subsidiaries or any assistance provided by the fdic to one of its fdic insured subsidiaries in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
the federal deposit insurance act  or fdia requires that the fdic review any merger or consolidation by or with an insured bank  or any establishment of branches by an insured bank 
the fdic is also empowered to regulate interest rates paid by insured banks 
approval of the fdic is also required before an insured bank retires any part of its common or preferred stock  or any capital notes or debentures 
insured banks that are also members of the federal reserve system  however  are regulated with respect to the foregoing matters by the federal reserve system 
payment of dividends we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries 
we receive most of our revenue from dividends paid to us by our delaware holding company subsidiary 
similarly  the delaware holding company subsidiary receives dividends from our bank subsidiaries 
described below are some of the laws and regulations that apply when either we or our subsidiary banks pay dividends 
each state bank that is a member of the federal reserve system and each national banking association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the occ  respectively  to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of such bank s net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus its retained net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two calendar years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed bad debts as defined by regulation 
our subsidiary banks paid aggregate dividends of approximately million in and approximately million in under the dividend restrictions discussed above  as of december   our subsidiary banks  without obtaining governmental approvals  could have declared in the aggregate additional dividends of approximately million from retained net profits 
to pay dividends  we and our subsidiary banks must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines 
in addition  if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the bank  could include the payment of dividends  the authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice 
the federal reserve board and the occ have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic have issued policy statements that recommend that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings 
affiliate transactions the federal reserve act and the fdia restrict the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from  or engage in certain other transactions with  our depository subsidiaries 
these laws regulate covered transactions between insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries  on the one hand  and their nondepository affiliates  on the other hand 
covered transactions include a loan or extension of credit to a nondepository affiliate  a purchase of securities issued by such an affiliate  a purchase of assets from such an affiliate unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve board  an acceptance of securities issued by such an affiliate as collateral for a loan  and an issuance of a guarantee  acceptance  or letter of credit for the benefit of such an affiliate 
the covered transactions that an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries are permitted to engage in with their nondepository affiliates are limited to the following amounts in the case of any one such affiliate  the aggregate amount of covered transactions cannot exceed ten percent of the capital stock and the surplus of the insured depository institution  and in the case of all affiliates  the aggregate amount of covered transactions cannot exceed twenty percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution 
in addition  extensions of credit that constitute covered transactions must be collateralized in prescribed amounts 
further  a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of services 
finally  when we and our subsidiary banks conduct transactions internally among us  we are required to do so at arm s length 
capital bank holding companies 
the federal reserve board has adopted risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit must be a minimum of eight percent 
at least half of the total capital is to be composed of common shareholders equity  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill  which is collectively referred to as tier capital 
the remainder of total capital may consist of subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a limited amount of loan loss reserves 
in addition  the federal reserve board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating  must maintain a minimum tier capital leverage ratio tier capital to average assets for the current quarter  less goodwill of three percent 
bank holding companies that do not have the highest regulatory rating will generally be required to maintain a higher tier capital leverage ratio of three percent plus an additional cushion of to basis points 
the federal reserve board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to it 
the guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions 
such strong capital positions must be kept substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets eg  goodwill  core deposit intangibles and purchased mortgage servicing rights 
as of december   our capital ratios were as follows tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio   total capital to risk weighted assets ratio   and tier capital leverage ratio  
banks 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia established five capital tiers with respect to depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures  including risk based capital measures  a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors 
regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that a well capitalized institution will have a total risk based capital ratio of ten percent or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of six percent or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of five percent or greater  and not be subject to any written regulatory enforcement agreement  order  capital directive or prompt corrective action derivative 
for an institution to be adequately capitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio of eight percent or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of four percent or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of four percent or greater in some cases three percent 
for an institution to be undercapitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio that is less than eight percent  a tier risk based capital ratio less than four percent or a tier leverage ratio less than four percent or a leverage ratio less than three percent if the institution is rated composite in its most recent report of examination  subject to appropriate federal banking agency guidelines 
for an institution to be significantly undercapitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio less than six percent  a tier risk based capital ratio less than three percent  or a tier leverage ratio less than three percent 
for an institution to be critically undercapitalized  it will have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than two percent 
fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action against depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
under current regulations  we were well capitalized as of december  fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
an undercapitalized institution must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that institution s compliance with such plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  it shall be treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
finally  fdicia requires the various regulatory agencies to set forth certain standards that do not relate to capital 
such standards relate to the safety and soundness of operations and management and to asset quality and executive compensation  and permit regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards 
if an insured bank fails to meet its capital guidelines  it may be subject to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic 
bank regulators continue to indicate their desire to raise capital requirements beyond their current levels 
in addition to fdicia capital standards  texas chartered banks must also comply with the capital requirements imposed by the texas banking department 
neither the texas finance code nor its regulations specify any minimum capital to assets ratio that must be maintained by a texas chartered bank 
instead  the texas banking department determines the appropriate ratio on a bank by bank basis  considering factors such as the nature of a bank s business  its total revenue  and the bank s total assets 
as of december   all of our texas chartered banks exceeded the minimum ratios applied to them 
our support of our subsidiary banks under federal reserve board policy  we are expected to commit resources to support each of our subsidiary banks 
this support may be required at times when  absent such federal reserve board policy  we would not otherwise be required to provide it 
in addition  any loans we make to our subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to other indebtedness of our banks 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and be subject to a priority of payment 
under the national bank act  if the capital stock of a national bank is impaired by losses or otherwise  the occ is authorized to require the bank s shareholders to pay the deficiency on a pro rata basis 
if any shareholder refuses to pay the pro rata assessment after three months notice  then the bank s board of directors must sell an appropriate amount of the shareholder s stock at a public auction to make up the deficiency 
to the extent necessary  if a deficiency in capital still exist and the bank refuses to go into liquidation  then a receiver may be appointed to wind up the bank s affairs 
interstate banking and branching act pursuant to the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  or riegle neal act  a bank holding company is able to acquire banks in states other than its home state 
prior to september   federal law provided that the federal reserve board could only approve interstate acquisitions by bank holding companies that were specifically authorized by the laws of the state in which the bank whose shares were to be acquired was located 
the riegle neal act also authorized banks to merge across state lines  thereby creating interstate branches  beginning june  under this act  each state had the opportunity to opt out of this provision  thereby prohibiting interstate branching in such states  or to opt in at an earlier time  thereby allowing interstate branching within that state prior to june  furthermore  pursuant to this act  a bank is now able to open new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations  if the laws of such state permit it to do so 
although texas had adopted legislation to opt out of the interstate branching provisions  recent judicial decisions and texas legislation have superseded this opt out legislation 
accordingly  both the occ and the texas banking department are presently accepting applications for interstate merger and branching transactions  subject to certain limitations on ages of the banks to be acquired and the total amount of deposits within the state a bank holding company may control 
since our primary service area is texas  these developments are not expected to have any material impact on our growth strategy 
we may  however  face increased competition from out of state banks that branch or make acquisitions in our primary markets 
community reinvestment act of the community reinvestment act of  or cra subjects a bank to regulatory assessment to determine if the institution meets the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods served by the bank  and to take that determination into account in its evaluation of any application made by such bank for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger  or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
the regulatory authority prepares a written evaluation of an institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community and assigns a rating 
our subsidiary banks have taken significant actions to comply with the cra  and each has received at least a satisfactory commendation in its most recent review by federal regulators with respect to its compliance with the cra 
both the united states congress and the banking regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the cra and fair lending laws  rules and regulations  and there can be no certainty as to the effect  if any  that any such changes would have on our subsidiary banks 
consumer laws and regulations we are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the following list is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair housing act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
these and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in our activities 
we must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of our ongoing customer relations 
technology risk management and consumer privacy state and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions 
banks are contracting increasingly with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions 
the use of technology related products  services  delivery channels and processes expose a bank to various risks  particularly operational  privacy  security  strategic  reputation and compliance risk 
banks are generally expected to successfully manage technology related risks with all other risks to ensure that a bank s risk management is integrated and comprehensive  primarily through identifying  measuring  monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology 
under section of the gramm leach bliley act  the federal banking agencies are required to establish appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer 
the agencies have published a joint final rule which is effective july  among other matters  the rule requires each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative  technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information 
under the gramm leach bliley act  a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices 
section prohibits a financial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure 
under section  the agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution s ability to disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
in june  the federal banking agencies issued a final rule  effective november   but compliance with which is optional until july  under the rule  all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices which describe in general terms the bank s information sharing practices 
banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure with certain exceptions 
limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card  deposit  or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing 
monetary policy banks are affected by the credit policies of other monetary authorities  including the federal reserve board  that affect the national supply of credit 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of credit in order to influence general economic conditions  primarily through open market operations in united states government obligations  varying the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  varying reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and restricting certain borrowings by financial institutions and their subsidiaries 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
pending and proposed legislation proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the gramm leach bliley act has especially created an increased level of rule making and debate on the structure of the united states banking system 
the likelihood and timing of any proposals or bills being enacted and the impact they might have on us and our subsidiary banks cannot be determined at this time

balance sheet review loans 
the loan portfolio is comprised of loans made to businesses  individuals  and farm and ranch operations located in the primary trade areas served by our subsidiary banks 
real estate loans represent loans primarily for new home construction and owner occupied real estate 
the structure of loans in the real estate mortgage classification generally provides repricing intervals to minimize the interest rate risk inherent in fixed rate mortgage loans

loan portfolios of each of our subsidiary banks are subject to periodic reviews by our centralized independent loan review group as well as periodic examinations by state and federal bank regulatory agencies 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when  in the judgment of management  the collectibility of principal or interest under the original terms becomes doubtful 
nonperforming assets  which consist of nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets  were million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  as a percent of loans and foreclosed assets  nonperforming assets were at december   as compared to at december  and at december  management considers the level of nonperforming assets to be manageable and is not aware of any material classified credit not properly disclosed as nonperforming at december  table nonperforming assets in thousands  except percentages at december  nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more restructured loans nonperforming loans      foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets      as a of loans and foreclosed assets provision and allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount deemed by management as of a specific date to be adequate to provide for possible losses on loans that may become uncollectible 
management determines the allowance and the required provision expense by reviewing general loss experiences and the performances of specific credits 
the provision for loan losses was million for as compared to million for and million for as a percent of average loans  net loan charge offs were during  during and during the lower net charge off ratio for resulted primarily from a thousand reduction in consumer related loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was as of december   as compared to as of december  management anticipates that the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans will remain above in future periods 
a key indicator of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans  which consist of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days  and restructured loans 
this ratio for the past five years is disclosed in the following table table loan loss experience and allowance for loan losses in thousands  except percentages balance at january       allowance established from purchase acquisition  loans charged off      loans recovered     net charge offs      provision for loan losses      balance at december       loans at year end      average loans      net charge offs average loans allowance for loan losses year end loans allowance for loan losses nonperforming assets investment securities

banking regulators measure capital adequacy by means of the risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio 
the risk based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off balance sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories ranging from to 
regulatory capital is then divided by risk weighted assets to determine the risk adjusted capital ratios 
the leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders equity less intangible assets by quarter to date average assets less intangible assets 
regulatory minimums for risk based and leverage ratios are and  respectively 
as of december   our total risk based and leverage ratios were and  respectively  as compared to total risk based and leverage ratios of and as of december  in  we experienced a higher rate of growth in tangible equity capital than assets  which resulted in higher capital ratios as of december   as compared to december  interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
our exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through our strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
we use no off balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
each of our subsidiary banks has an asset liability committee that monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies 
each subsidiary bank tracks interest rate risk by  among other things  interest sensitivity gap and simulation analysis 
table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated assets and liabilities as of december   and sets forth the repricing dates of our consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as our projected consolidated interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
the table is based upon assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
these assumptions are estimates made by management 
assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the following table does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest rate movements on our consolidated net interest income

management estimates that  as of december  and december   an upward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in an increase of projected net interest income of and  respectively  and a downward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and  respectively 
these are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
also  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
in management s belief  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude 
management believes that it is unlikely that such changes would occur in a short time period 
as interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements  various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion 
since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions  our future results would  in management s belief  be different from the foregoing estimates  and such results could be material 
liquidity 
liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise 
such needs can develop from loan demand  deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets  which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  federal funds sold  and short term investments in time deposits in banks 
liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources  which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to our subsidiary banks 
given the strong core deposit base and relatively low loan deposit ratios maintained at the subsidiary banks  management considers the current liquidity position to be adequate to meet short and long term liquidity needs 
parent company funding 
our ability to fund various operating expenses  dividends  and cash acquisitions is generally dependent solely on our own earnings without giving effect to our subsidiaries  cash reserves and funds derived from our subsidiary banks 
these funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses 
we anticipate that our recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from our subsidiary banks 
at december   approximately million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by the subsidiary banks without the prior approval of regulatory agencies 
also at december   we had million available under a line of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution 
dividends 
our long term dividend policy is to pay cash dividends to our shareholders of between and of net earnings while maintaining adequate capital to support growth 
the dividend payout ratios have amounted to  and of net earnings  respectively  in  and given the current strong capital position and projected earnings and asset growth rates  we do not anticipate any change in our current dividend policy
