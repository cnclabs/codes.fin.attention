item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nce is engaged in the acquisition and enhancement of developed natural gas and oil producing properties and the exploration  development and production of undeveloped natural gas and oil properties  owned by the company or in conjunction with joint ventures or partnerships sponsored and managed by the company 
nce derives its revenues from its own oil and gas production  turnkey drilling  well operations  gas gathering  transportation and gas marketing services it provides for third parties 
during the fiscal year ended march   nce successfully integrated nce eastern which was acquired in march  and successfully executed drilling and development activities that resulted in significant increases in its operations  proved reserves and financial results 
average wells operated increased from approximately  in to approximately  in as a result of the nce eastern acquisition 
nce s proved developed natural gas reserves increased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for fiscal and proved developed oil reserves increased to  bbls from  bbls 
the increase in proved reserves at the fiscal year end resulted from a successful exploration and development program and the extension of well lives due to higher prices for natural gas at march  compared to march  the proved gas reserves developed and undeveloped increased to bcf for fiscal from bcf for fiscal the increase in proved gas reserves was due to the increases mentioned previously for the proved developed reserves 
proved oil reserves developed and undeveloped increased to  bbls for fiscal from  bbls for fiscal nce recognizes as proved undeveloped reserves only the potential oil and gas which can reasonably be expected to be recovered from drillable locations which it owned or to which it had rights at fiscal year end which are directly offsetting locations to wells that have indicated commercial production in the objective formation and which nce fully expects to drill in the near future 
changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are set forth in note of the company s financial statements 
the above mentioned additions and sales of natural gas  coupled with the development costs associated with undeveloped acreage  create timing differences which are reflected in the other category of the standardized measure 
of the company s total proved reserves  approximately are proved developed and approximately are proved undeveloped based upon equivalent unit mcfs 
proved undeveloped acreage requires considerable capital expenditures to develop 
management believes that a significant percentage of the proved undeveloped reserves should be recovered in future years  although no assurance of such recovery can be given 
the following table is a review of the results of operations of the company for the fiscal years ended march   and all items in the table are calculated as a percentage of total revenues

the company received an average price of and per barrel of oil for fiscal and  and and per mcf for natural gas for fiscal years and  respectively 
drilling revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to the increase in the number of wells recognized in revenue for the comparable year ends 
drilling revenues were recognized on wells for fiscal year compared to wells for fiscal well operating  gathering and other revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increases result primarily from increased volumes of gas transported through facilities owned by nce and an increase in wells operated for third parties

the company s net income as a result of the aforementioned areas of improvement increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year ended march  inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the company s operating expenses as well as interest rates  which may have an affect on the company s profitability 
oil and gas prices have not followed inflation and have fluctuated during recent years as a result of other forces such as opec  economic factors  demand for and supply of natural gas in the united states and within the company s regional area of operation 
oil prices during the company s fiscal year have increased as a result of continued production constraints by members of opec which has reduced the available supply of crude oil to world markets 
natural gas prices have also increased particularly during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march   but have retreated since then 
these increases in price are attributed to lower storage supplies following the winter of and higher natural gas demand for the generation of electricity in the united states 
as a result of these market forces  the company received an average price of per barrel of oil for fiscal compared to for fiscal the company received an average price of per mcf for its natural gas for fiscal compared to for fiscal the company cannot predict the duration of the current strength of oil and gas markets and price  as those forces noted above  as well as other variables  may change 
currently  nce sells natural gas under fixed price contracts  on the spot market and uses financial hedging instruments to realize a fixed price on a portion of its production 
the company has positioned itself to take advantage of current market conditions by fixing a greater portion of its gas to contracts of a year or longer at prices substantially higher than were received in recent years 
additionally  the company continues to acquire and construct new gathering systems to transport natural gas from company wells and third parties

actual results may differ materially from forward looking information included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to commodity price and interest rate risks 
the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt including debt under the company s revolving credit facility and the subordinated promissory note between the company and nuon 
at march   substantially all of the company s total long term debt consisted of floating rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from march   and assuming no changes in long term debt from the march   levels  the additional annual expense would be approximately  on a pre tax basis 
the company currently does not hedge its exposure to this floating interest rate risk 
the company is exposed to commodity price risks related to natural gas and oil 
the company s financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in commodity prices 
effective with may production  the company entered into a natural gas hedge to eliminate exposure to changes in natural gas prices that may affect a portion of its net production contracted to one large industrial customer 
the hedge involves the use of a financial swap and fixes the company s price at per mcf on  mcf per day through december gains or losses on the hedge relative to the market are recognized monthly as additions to or subtractions from oil and gas sales 
subsequent to march   the company entered into a costless collar arrangement that establishes a floor and ceiling price and per mcf  respectively for  mcf per day through march  the information included in this item is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended
