recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas was amended in june by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas no 
 which addressed a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure them at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
to the extent derivative instruments qualify and are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows associated with forecasted transactions  the effective portion of the gain or loss on such derivative instruments will generally be reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion  if any  will be reported in net income 
such amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into net income when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
to the extent derivative instruments qualify and are designated as hedges of changes in the fair value of an existing asset  liability or firm commitment  the gain or loss on the hedging instrument will be recognized currently in earnings along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective october  the company s derivative instruments outstanding as of october   variable to fixed interest rate swaps see note  will not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas the adoption of sfas will require the company to mark its interest rate swaps to market 
the result will be to record a net liability of  with an offsetting cumulative effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income 
such amount in accumulative other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the company records interest expense on the debt associated with the interest rate swaps 
in that the company s derivative instruments outstanding do not meet the stringent requirements for hedge accounting under sfas  future earnings could reflect greater volatility
