the following information with respect to timet commission file number has been summarized from such reports which contain more detailed information concerning the business  results of operations and financial condition of timet 
general 
timet is one of the world s leading integrated producers of titanium sponge  melted and mill products 
timet is the only integrated producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
timet estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of mill products and approximately of worldwide sponge production 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were approximately of industry mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with such diverse uses as offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor  automotive and architectural applications 
timet s products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  melted products comprised of titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
timet believes it is among the lower cost producers of titanium sponge and melted products due in part to its manufacturing expertise and technology 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers which  like timet  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
timet is presently the only active titanium sponge producer in the us timet s long term strategy is to maximize the value of its core aerospace business and  at the same time  develop new markets  applications and products to help reduce its traditional dependence on the aerospace industry 
timet s focus in the short term is to return to profitability and generate positive cash flow 
to accomplish its short term goals  timet is attempting to reduce costs  improve quality and streamline its overall business and manufacturing processes as well as maximize its participation in the increasing demand for aerospace quality titanium during this business cycle 
industry 
the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in  and during the to period  timet reported aggregate net income of million which more than offset the aggregate net losses of million it reported during the difficult to period 
timet also reported net losses in and aggregating million 
timet currently expects to report a net loss in  however  it expects that its loss in will be substantially reduced from levels as a result of the recent upturn in its business cycle 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations timet 
demand for titanium reached a peak in when worldwide industry mill product shipments reached an estimated  metric tons 
industry mill product shipments subsequently declined approximately to an estimated  metric tons in  with a further decline to an estimated  metric tons in and timet expects that worldwide industry mill product shipments will increase in by approximately to about  metric tons 
the expected increase is primarily attributable to stronger demand resulting from an increase in forecasted aircraft build rates  as well as a substantial decrease in the amount of excess titanium inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain 
the present business environment is substantially different from that in to during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached  and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
this resulted in considerable excess inventory throughout the supply chain 
during  aerospace customers continued to focus on reducing inventories and a significant number of timet s aerospace customers canceled or delayed previously scheduled orders 
the aerospace supply chain is fragmented and decentralized making it difficult to quantify excess inventories 
however  customer actions such as order delays ie pushouts and cancellations  combined with other data provide limited visibility 
during  timet experienced no significant customer pushouts or cancellations of deliveries 
late in and early  timet experienced an increase in orders for aerospace quality titanium products and certain customers requested advanced delivery of existing orders and its order backlog increased substantially 
although quantitative information is not readily available  these factors and others lead timet to believe that the excess titanium inventory throughout the supply chain has been substantially reduced and is unlikely to be a significant factor in in most areas 
mill product shipments to the aerospace industry in represented about of total industry demand and about of timet s annual mill product shipments 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components ie blades  discs  rings and engine cases and air frame components ie bulkheads  tail sections  landing gears  wing supports and fasteners can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
industry shipments of mill products to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of aerospace demand and of aggregate titanium mill product demand 
timet believes that demand for mill products for the commercial aerospace sector will be the principal driver of the expected increase in industry mill product shipments during demand growth for these markets and sectors is expected to exceed the aggregate growth in titanium mill product shipments while other markets are expected to experience lesser growth 
shipments to the commercial aerospace sector represented approximately of timet s sales volume in accordingly  timet believes its sales volume in may increase more than the expected increase in titanium industry mill product shipments 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the commercial airline industry reported operating income of approximately billion estimated in  compared to billion in and billion in according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft including wide body aircraft 
wide body aircraft use substantially more titanium than narrow body aircraft 
commercial aircraft deliveries are currently expected to be including wide bodies in and including wide bodies in the demand for titanium generally precedes aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
accordingly  timet s cycle historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
timet can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will affect demand for timet s products 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has expanded 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants  and pollution control equipment 
titanium is also experiencing increased customer demand in several emerging markets with diverse uses such as offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor  and automotive and architectural applications 
while shipments to emerging markets represented less than of timet s sales volume in  timet believes these emerging applications represent potential growth opportunities 
if titanium usage in these markets continues to develop  they may  over time  reduce the industry s and timet s dependence on the aerospace industry 
for example  titanium manufactured by timet is being used to produce the exhaust system for the model of the chevrolet corvette z  the first significant titanium component selected for a production automobile 
volkswagen is using titanium supplied by timet in the suspension springs on the model year lupo fsi automobile 
in a separate market  timet delivered titanium production casing during for one of the largest geothermal wells in the world 
customer agreements 
timet has long term agreements ltas with certain major aerospace customers  including the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc  united technologies corporation and related companies and wyman gordon company a unit of precision castparts corporation 
these agreements  which became effective in and  generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements generally at least for extended periods nine to ten years and ii fixed or formula determined prices generally for at least the first five years 
the ltas were structured to provide incentives to both parties to lower timet s costs and share in the savings 
these contracts and others represent the core of timet s long term aerospace strategy 
these agreements were designed to limit pricing volatility both up and down for the long term benefit of both parties  while providing timet with a solid base of aerospace volume 
the lta with boeing requires boeing to purchase a minimum percentage of its and its suppliers titanium requirements from timet commencing in although boeing placed orders and accepted delivery of certain volumes in and  the level of orders placed by boeing in and was significantly below the contractual volume requirements for those years 
boeing informed timet in that it was unwilling to commit to the contract beyond the year timet presently expects to receive less than the minimum contractual order volume from boeing in in march  timet filed a lawsuit against boeing in colorado state court seeking damages for boeing s repudiation and breach of the boeing contract 
timet s complaint seeks damages from boeing that timet believes could be in excess of million and a declaration from the court of timet s rights under the contract 
in june  boeing filed its answer to timet s complaint denying substantially all of timet s allegations and making certain counterclaims against timet 
timet believes such counterclaims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against such claims 
the litigation is in the discovery phase  with a trial date currently set for january timet continues to have discussions with boeing about possible settlement of the matter 
there can be no assurance that timet will achieve a favorable outcome to this litigation 
as a complement to the ltas entered into with timet s key customers  timet has also entered into agreements with certain key suppliers that are intended to assure anticipated raw material needs to satisfy production requirements for timet s key customers 
certain provisions of these contracts  such as minimum purchase commitments and prices  have been renegotiated in the past and may be renegotiated in the future to meet changing business conditions and to address boeing s underperformance under its lta 
acquisitions and capital transactions during the past five years 
at the beginning of  timet was owned by tremont and its operations were conducted primarily in the united states 
during  timet expanded both geographically and operationally as a result of the acquisition of the titanium business of imi plc  the acquisition of certain assets from axel johnson metals  inc and certain smaller acquisitions in europe 
in  timet i acquired loterios spa to increase market share in industrial markets  and provide increased geographic sales coverage in europe  ii purchased for cash million of non voting and non marketable preferred securities of special metals corporation  a us manufacturer of wrought nickel based superalloys and special alloy long products  and iii entered into a castings joint venture with wyman gordon 
in january  timet sold its interest in the castings joint venture for million and realized a gain of million on the sale 
in  tremont purchased additional timet common stock in market transactions 
in  tremont exercised an option to purchase approximately two million shares of timet s common stock 
at december   tremont held approximately of timet s outstanding common stock 
an additional of timet s outstanding common stock is owned by the combined master retirement trust  a trust formed by valhi  inc  an affiliate of tremont  to permit the collective investment by trusts that maintain the assets of certain employee benefit plans adopted by valhi and related entities 
products and operations 
timet is a vertically integrated titanium producer whose products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  melted products comprised of titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
in  all of timet s sales were generated by timet s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment 
the titanium product chain is described below 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores  derived from beach sand  with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
timet s titanium sponge production capacity in henderson  nevada  incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the reactor mass into the condensing vessel 
the titanium mass is then mechanically pushed out of the original reactor  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingots and slabs are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each is formed by melting titanium sponge or scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products 
the melting process for ingots and slabs is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
ingots and slabs are both sold to customers and further processed into mill products 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing  welding and or extrusion of titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
timet sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to timet s service centers 
timet s customers usually process timet s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  timet performs extensive testing on its products  including sponge  ingot and mill products 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing and ultrasonic and x ray testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that timet s products meet the high quality requirements of customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
timet is reliant on several outside processors to perform certain rolling and finishing steps in the us  and certain melting  forging and finishing steps in france 
in the us  one of the processors that performs these steps in relation to strip production and another as relates to plate finishing are owned by a competitor 
these processors are currently the sole source for these services 
other processors used in the us are not competitors 
in france the processor is also a joint venture partner in timet s owned subsidiary  timet savoie 
although timet believes that there are other metal producers with the capability to perform these same processing functions  arranging for alternative processors  or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on timet s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in the short term 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying elements 
timet processes rutile ore into titanium tetrachloride and further processes the titanium tetrachloride into titanium sponge 
during  approximately of timet s melted and mill product production was made from internally produced sponge  from purchased sponge  from titanium scrap and from alloying elements 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
titanium containing rutile ore is currently available from a number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa  india and the united states 
a majority of timet s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
timet believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its raw material supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which timet purchases its raw materials could materially and adversely affect availability 
although timet believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that timet will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single supplier near timet s sponge plant 
timet believes that this supplier is experiencing certain financial difficulties and  accordingly  there can be no assurances the chlorine supply from this provider may not be interrupted 
timet is in the process of evaluating whether to make certain equipment modifications to enable it to utilize alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase an intermediate product which will allow timet to bypass the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium ingot are available from a number of suppliers 
while timet was one of six major worldwide producers of titanium sponge in  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a substantial portion of its sponge requirements 
titanium mill and melted products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
recently  allegheny technologies  inc announced that it was idling its titanium sponge production facility  making timet the only active us producer of titanium sponge 
as a consequence  timet believes the availability of certain grades of titanium sponge  principally premium quality sponge  used for certain aerospace applications currently is tight 
presently  timet and certain suppliers in japan are the only producers of premium quality sponge 
historically timet has purchased sponge predominantly from producers in japan and kazakhstan 
in  timet expects to purchase sponge principally from japan  kazakhstan and from the us defense logistics agency s stockpile of sponge 
timet has a ten year lta for the purchase of titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan to support demand for both aerospace and non aerospace applications 
the sponge contract runs through  with firm pricing through subject to certain possible adjustments and possible early termination in 
the contract provides for annual purchases by timet of  to  metric tons 
timet agreed to reduced minimums of  metric tons for and  metric tons for timet has no other long term sponge supply agreements 
timet facilities 
in addition to its us sponge capacity discussed below  timet s worldwide melting capacity in aggregates approximately  metric tons estimated of world capacity  and its mill products capacity aggregates approximately  metric tons estimated of world capacity 
approximately of timet s worldwide melting capacity is represented by electron beam cold hearth melting eb furnaces  by vacuum arc remelting var furnaces and by a vacuum induction melting vim furnace 
timet has operated its major production facilities at varying levels of practical capacity during the past three years 
in  the plants operated at of practical capacity  decreasing to in and increasing to approximately in in  timet s plants are expected to operate at to of practical capacity 
however  practical capacity and utilization measures can vary significantly based upon the mix of products produced 
during  timet closed  metric tons of melting capacity by permanently shutting down facilities in verdi  nevada and millbury  massachusetts 
in  timet temporarily idled its kroll leach process sponge facility in nevada due to changing market conditions for certain grades of titanium sponge

timet expects the consumption of henderson produced vdp sponge in its european operations to be of their sponge requirements in the raw materials processing facilities in morgantown primarily process scrap used as melting feedstock  either in combination with sponge or separately 
timet s us melting facilities produce ingots and slabs both sold to customers and used as feedstock for its mill products operations 
these melting facilities are expected to operate at approximately of aggregate capacity in titanium mill products are produced by timet in the us at its forging and rolling facility in toronto  ohio  which receives intermediate titanium products principally from timet s us melting facilities

during  timet savoie expects to operate close to the maximum capacity required to be provided by cezus 
sponge for melting requirements in both the uk and france that is not supplied by timet s us henderson plant  is purchased principally from suppliers in japan and kazakhstan 
distribution 
timet sells its products through its own sales force based in the us and europe  and through independent agents worldwide 
timet s marketing and distribution system also includes eight timet owned service centers five in the us and three in europe  which sell timet s products on a just in time basis 
timet believes that it has a competitive sales and cost advantage arising from the location of its production plants and service centers  which are in close proximity to major customers 
these centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products including bar and flat rolled sheet and strip 
timet believes its service centers give it a competitive advantage because of their ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
markets and customer base 
about of timet s sales were to customers within north america  with about to european customers and the balance to other regions 
during and  precision castparts corporation pcc acquired wyman gordon company and a forging company in the uk sales to pcc and these related entities aggregated of timet s net sales in approximately of timet s mill product sales were used by timet s customers to produce parts and other materials for the aerospace industry 
sales under timet s ltas with certain major aerospace customers accounted for approximately of its aerospace sales in timet expects that while a majority of its sales will be to the aerospace industry  other markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial aircraft  european aeronautic defence and space company parent company of the airbus consortium and boeing commercial airplane group  and four major manufacturers of aircraft engines  rolls royce  pratt whitney a unit of united technologies corporation  general electric and snecma 
timet s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use timet s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on timet 
timet s order backlog was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during although timet believes that the backlog is a reliable indicator of near term business activity  conditions in the aerospace industry could change and result in future cancellations or deferrals of existing aircraft orders and materially and adversely affect timet s existing backlog  orders  and future financial condition and operating results 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total fly weight than narrow body planes 
fly weight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines but without fuel or passengers 
the boeing  for example  utilizes titanium for approximately of total fly weight  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to of total backlog at the end of although airbus has announced that it intends to build the new wide body a  no orders for the a were included in the airline monitor s backlog figures at december  as firm order agreements were unconfirmed 
additionally  the a is still being designed  therefore  reliable estimates of titanium usage on the a are not available at this time 
through various strategic relationships  timet seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
timet has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
timet also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  europe  former soviet union fsu and china 
with the idling of allegheny technologies sponge manufacturing facility discussed above  timet will be one of four integrated producers in the world  with integrated producers being considered as those that produce at least both sponge and ingot 
there are also a number of non integrated producers that produce mill products from purchased sponge  scrap or ingot 
timet s principal competitors in aerospace markets are allegheny technologies inc  rti international metals  inc 
and verkhanya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo 
these companies  along with the japanese producers and other companies  are also principal competitors in industrial markets 
timet competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates  tariffs and  with respect to japan and the fsu  existing and prior duties including antidumping duties 
however  imports of titanium sponge  scrap  and mill products  principally from the fsu  have increased in recent years and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent timet has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing such sponge  scrap or intermediate mill products from such countries for use in its own operations during recent years  the negative effect of these imports on timet has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports into the us of titanium products from countries designated by the us government as most favored nations are subject to a tariff for other countries 
titanium products for tariff purposes are broadly classified as either wrought or unwrought 
wrought products include bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing 
unwrought products include sponge  ingot  slab and billet 
starting in  imports of titanium wrought products from russia were exempted from this duty under the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to aid developing economies 
in  gsp benefits to these products were suspended when the level of russian wrought products imports reached of all imports of titanium wrought products 
a petition was filed in to restore duty free status to these products  and that petition was granted in june in addition  a petition was also filed to bring unwrought products under the gsp program  which would allow such products from the countries of the fsu notably russia and  in the case of sponge  kazakhstan and ukraine to be imported into the us without the payment of regular duties 
this petition concerning unwrought products has not been acted upon pending further investigation of the merits of such a change 
in addition to regular duties  titanium sponge imported from countries of the fsu russia  kazakhstan and ukraine had for many years been subject to substantial antidumping penalties 
titanium sponge imports from japan were also subject to a standing antidumping order  but no penalties had been attached in recent years 
in  the international trade commission itc revoked all outstanding antidumping orders on titanium sponge based upon a determination that changed circumstances in the industry did not warrant continuation of the orders 
timet has appealed that decision and the matter is still pending 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  all or any of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of timet 
however  timet has  in recent years  been a large importer of foreign titanium sponge and mill products into the us to the extent timet remains a substantial purchaser of these products  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to timet for these products to the extent it currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be modified without substantial expenditures to process titanium products 
timet believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
research and development 
timet s research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
this is achieved through developments in process technology  development of new alloys and products and enhancing the performance of timet s existing products 
applications for timet s proprietary alloys  such as timetal r  timetal and timetal lcb  continue to develop 
timet conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson  nevada laboratory  which timet believes is one of the largest titanium research and development centers in the world 
additional research and development activities are performed at the witton facility in birmingham  england 
patents and trademarks 
timet holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
timet continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by timet do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
timet believes that the trademarks timet r and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are significant to its business 
employees 
the historic cyclical nature of the aerospace business and its impact on timet s business is the principal reason that timet periodically implements cost reduction  reorganization and other changes that impact timet s employment levels 
the following table shows the significant reduction in the number of employees over the past years 
the reduction in employees from to was principally in response to a reduction in market demand 
during  timet reduced employment by an additional people  or approximately of timet s worldwide workforce 
however  in the third quarter of timet began increasing production levels and employment at certain facilities in response to an increase in demand for its products 
during  timet expects to add approximately people  principally in its manufacturing operations 
employees at december  us    europe  total    timet s production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada and its production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in october and june  respectively 
in september  timet entered into a new  four year collective bargaining agreement with the uswa representing approximately hourly workers at its henderson  nevada facility 
employees at timet s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
approximately of the salaried and hourly employees at timet s european facilities are represented by various european labor unions  generally under annual agreements 
in march  timet was notified that certain workers at cezus plant in ugine  france were engaged in a work slowdown related to wage and benefit issues 
cezus performs certain melting and forging operations on a contract basis for timet savoie 
while this slowdown may adversely impact shipments by timet savoie to its customers in the near term  based upon timet s current understanding of the situation  timet does not presently anticipate that this action will have a material adverse effect on its business or operations 
while timet currently considers its employee relations to be satisfactory  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages that could materially and adversely affect timet s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory and environmental matters 
timet s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the occupational  safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
timet uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in addition  at timet s henderson  nevada facility  timet produces and uses substantial quantities of titanium tetrachloride  a material classified as extremely hazardous under federal environmental laws 
timet has used such substances throughout the history of its operations 
as a result  risk of environmental damage is inherent in timet s operations 
timet s operations pose a continuing risk of accidental releases of  and worker exposure to  hazardous or toxic substances 
there is also a risk that government environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to timet s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
timet s operations in europe are similarly subject to foreign laws and regulations respecting environmental and worker safety matters  which laws have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow of timet 
timet believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker health and safety laws 
timet s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
from time to time  timet may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties 
timet incurred capital expenditures for health  safety and environmental compliance matters of approximately million in each of and and million in timet s capital budget provides for approximately million of such expenditures in however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental  health or safety laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies environmental matters timet  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
unconsolidated affiliate nl nl files periodic reports with the commission pursuant to the exchange act  as amended 
the following information with respect to nl commission file number has been summarized from such reports  which contain more detailed information concerning the business  results of operations and financial condition of nl 
general 
nl conducts its continuing operations through its principal wholly owned subsidiary  kronos  inc kronos is the world s fifth largest producer of titanium dioxide pigments tio with an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume in approximately one half of kronos sales volume was in europe  where kronos is the second largest producer of tio nl s primary objective is to maximize total shareholder return 
nl has taken a number of steps towards achieving its objective  including i increasing its regular quarterly dividend to 
per share  ii controlling costs  iii investing in certain cost effective debottlenecking projects to increase tio production capacity and efficiency  and iv improving its capital structure 
nl periodically considers mergers or acquisitions within the chemical industry and acquisitions of additional tio production capacity to meet its objective 
industry 
titanium dioxide pigments are chemical products used for imparting whiteness  brightness and opacity to a wide range of products  including paints  plastics  paper  fibers and ceramics 
tio is considered a quality of life product with demand affected by gross domestic product in various regions of the world 
pricing within the global tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
nl s average tio selling price on a billing currency basis increased from the preceding quarter during each quarter of  continuing the upward trend in prices that began in the fourth quarter of industry wide demand for tio was strong throughout most of  but weakened in the fourth quarter of nl believes that the weaker demand in the fourth quarter was due to a softening worldwide economy and customers reducing inventory levels 
kronos has an estimated share of european tio sales volume and an estimated share of north american tio sales volume 
per capita consumption of tio in the united states and western europe far exceeds that in other areas of the world and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of tio significant regions for tio consumption could emerge in eastern europe  the far east or china if the economies in these regions develop to the point that quality of life products  including tio  are in greater demand 
kronos believes that  due to its strong presence in western europe  it is well positioned to participate in growth in consumption of tio in eastern europe 
products and operations 
tio is produced in two crystalline forms rutile and anatase 
rutile tio is a more tightly bound crystal that has a higher refractive index than anatase tio and  therefore  better opacification and tinting strength in many applications 
although many end use applications can use either form of tio  rutile tio is the preferred form for use in coatings  plastics and ink 
anatase tio has a bluer undertone and is less abrasive than rutile tio  and it is often preferred for use in paper  ceramics  rubber and man made fibers 
nl believes that there are no effective substitutes for tio however  extenders such as kaolin clays  calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used in a number of kronos markets 
generally  extenders are used to reduce to some extent the utilization of higher cost tio the use of extenders has not significantly changed tio consumption over the past decade because  to date  extenders generally have failed to match the performance characteristics of tio as a result  nl believes that the use of extenders will not materially alter the growth of the tio business in the foreseeable future 
kronos currently produces over different tio grades  sold under the kronos trademark  which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers specific requirements 
kronos major customers include domestic and international paint  plastics and paper manufacturers 
kronos is one of the world s leading producers and marketers of tio kronos and its distributors and agents sell and provide technical services for its products to over  customers with the majority of sales in europe and north america 
tio is distributed by rail  truck and ocean carrier in either dry or slurry form 
kronos manufacturing facilities are located in germany  canada  belgium and norway and kronos owns a one half interest in a tio manufacturing joint venture located in louisiana  usa kronos has sales and marketing activities in over countries worldwide 
kronos and its predecessors have produced and marketed tio in north america and europe for over years 
as a result  kronos believes that it has developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture  sale  shipment and service of its products in domestic and international markets 
by volume  approximately one half of kronos tio sales were to europe  with to north america and the balance to export markets 
kronos is also engaged in the mining and sale of ilmenite ore a raw material used as a feedstock by sulfate process tio plants and has estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least years 
kronos is also engaged in the manufacture and sale of iron based water treatment chemicals derived from co products of the pigment production processes 
water treatment chemicals are used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater  and in the manufacture of iron pigments 
manufacturing process and raw materials 
tio is manufactured by kronos using both the chloride process and the sulfate process 
approximately two thirds of kronos production capacity is based on its chloride process which generates less waste than the sulfate process 
the sulfate process is a batch chemical process that uses sulfuric acid to extract tio sulfate technology normally produces either anatase or rutile pigment 
the chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile tio in general  the chloride process is also less intensive than the sulfate process in terms of capital investment  labor and energy 
because much of the chlorine is recycled and higher titanium containing feedstock is used  the chloride process produces less waste 
once an intermediate tio pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process  it is finished into products with specific performance characteristics for particular end use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and intensive milling and micronizing 
due to environmental factors and customer considerations  the proportion of tio industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process pigments and  in  chloride process production facilities represented almost of industry capacity 
kronos produced a record  metric tons of tio in  compared to  metric tons produced in and its previous record  metric tons in kronos average production capacity utilization rate in was near full capacity  up from in  primarily due to nl s decision to return to higher production levels to meet strengthening demand after curtailing production volume during the first quarter of to manage inventory levels 
kronos believes its current annual attainable production capacity is approximately  metric tons  including its one half interest in the joint venture owned louisiana plant see tio manufacturing joint venture 
nl expects its production capacity will be increased by approximately  metric tons primarily at its chloride facilities  with moderate capital expenditures  bringing kronos capacity to approximately  metric tons during such expectations about nl s future tio production capacity exclude the effect  if any  resulting from a fire that occurred at one of nl s german tio production facilities discussed below 
the primary raw materials used in the tio chloride production process are titanium containing feedstock derived from beach sand ilmenite  natural rutile ore  chlorine and coke 
chlorine and coke are available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally in australia  south africa  canada  india and the united states 
kronos purchases slag refined from beach sand ilmenite from richards bay iron and titanium proprietary limited south africa  a owned subsidiary of rio tinto plc uk  under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of natural rutile ore is purchased primarily from iluka resources  inc australia  a wholly owned subsidiary of westralian sands limited australia  under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of nl does not expect to encounter difficulties obtaining long term extensions to existing supply contracts prior to the expiration of the contracts 
raw materials purchased under these contracts and extensions thereof are expected to meet kronos chloride feedstock requirements over the next several years 
the primary raw materials used in the tio sulfate production process are titanium containing feedstock derived primarily from rock and beach sand ilmenite and sulfuric acid 
sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers around the world 
currently  the principal active sources are located in norway  canada  australia  india and south africa 
as one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate process pigments  kronos operates a rock ilmenite mine in norway  which provided all of kronos feedstock for its european sulfate process pigment plants in for its canadian sulfate process plant  kronos also purchases sulfate grade slag from qit fer et titane inc canada  a wholly owned subsidiary of rio tinto  under a long term supply contract which expires in kronos believes the availability of titanium containing feedstock for both the chloride and sulfate processes is adequate for the next several years 
kronos does not expect to experience any interruptions of its raw material supplies because of its long term supply contracts 
however  political and economic instability in certain countries from which nl purchases its raw material supplies could adversely affect the availability of such feedstock 
should kronos vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should kronos be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials  nl may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels  which may have a material adverse effect on nl s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
tio manufacturing joint venture 
subsidiaries of kronos and huntsman ici holdings huntsman each own a interest in a manufacturing joint venture  louisiana pigment company lpc 
lpc owns and operates a chloride process tio plant located in lake charles  louisiana 
production from the plant is shared equally by kronos and huntsman the partners pursuant to separate offtake agreements 
a supervisory committee  composed of four members  two of whom are appointed by each partner  directs the business and affairs of lpc including production and output decisions 
two general managers  one appointed and compensated by each partner  manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee 
the manufacturing joint venture operates on a break even basis and  accordingly  nl reports no equity in earnings of the joint venture 
kronos cost for its share of the tio produced is equal to its share of the joint venture s costs 
kronos share of the joint venture s interest expense in was reported as a component of interest expense 
kronos share of all other net costs is reported as cost of sales as the related tio acquired from the joint venture is sold 
competition 
the tio industry is highly competitive 
kronos competes primarily on the basis of price  product quality and technical service  and the availability of high performance pigment grades 
although certain tio grades are considered specialty pigments  the majority of kronos grades and substantially all of kronos production are considered commodity pigments with price generally being the most significant competitive factor 
during kronos had an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume  and kronos believes that it is the leading seller of tio in a number of countries  including germany and canada 
kronos principal competitors are ei du pont de nemours co 
dupont  millennium chemicals  inc  huntsman  kerr mcgee corporation  and ishihara sangyo kaisha  ltd 
kronos five largest competitors have estimated individual shares of tio production capacity ranging from to  and an estimated aggregate share of worldwide tio production volume 
dupont has about one half of total us tio production capacity and is kronos principal north american competitor 
in kerr mcgee acquired kemira pigments oy s tio businesses in the netherlands and the us capacity additions that are the result of construction of greenfield plants in the worldwide tio market require significant capital and substantial lead time  typically three to five years in nl s experience 
no greenfield plants have been announced  but industry capacity can be expected to increase as kronos and its competitors debottleneck existing plants 
based on the factors described under the caption industry above  nl expects that the average annual increase in industry capacity from announced debottlenecking projects will be less than the average annual demand growth for tio during the next three to five years 
no assurance can be given that future increases in the tio industry production capacity and future average annual demand growth rates for tio will conform to nl s expectations 
if actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl and the tio industry s performance could be unfavorably affected 
discontinued operations 
on january   nl sold its specialty chemicals business for million 
nl has reported its specialty chemicals business as discontinued operations 
research and development 
nl s expenditures for research and development and certain technical support programs  excluding discontinued operations  have averaged approximately million annually during the past three years 
research and development activities are conducted principally at the leverkusen  germany facility 
such activities are directed primarily toward improving both the chloride and sulfate production processes  improving product quality and strengthening kronos competitive position by developing new pigment applications 
patents and trademarks 
patents held for products and production processes are believed to be important to nl and to the continuing business activities of kronos 
nl continually seeks patent protection for its technical developments  principally in the united states  canada and europe  and from time to time enters into licensing arrangements with third parties 
nl s major trademarks  including kronos  are protected by registration in the united states and elsewhere with respect to those products it manufactures and sells 
foreign operations 
nl s chemical businesses have operated in non us markets since the s 
most of kronos current production capacity is located in europe and canada with non us net property and equipment aggregating million at december  net property and equipment in the us  including of the property and equipment of the tio manufacturing joint venture  was million at december  kronos european operations include production facilities in germany  belgium and norway 
approximately million of nl s consolidated sales were to non us customers  including million to customers in areas other than europe and canada 
sales to customers in the us aggregated million in foreign operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations and nl s results of operations have  in the past  been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on nl s results of operations are discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations nl industries and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk nl industries 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which nl operates may expose it to risk of loss 
nl does not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or similar event 
nl cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material effect on its operations 
nl s manufacturing and mining operations are also subject to extensive and diverse environmental regulation in each of the foreign countries in which they operate 
see regulatory and environmental matters 
below 
customer base and seasonality 
nl believes that neither its aggregate sales nor those of any of its principal product groups are concentrated in or materially dependent upon any single customer or small group of customers 
kronos largest ten customers accounted for of net sales in neither nl s business as a whole nor that of any of its principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent 
due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet the spring and summer painting season demand  tio sales are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
nl facilities 
during  kronos operated four tio facilities in europe leverkusen and nordenham  germany  langerbrugge  belgium  and fredrikstad  norway 
in north america  kronos has a facility in varennes  quebec  canada and  through the manufacturing joint venture described above  a one half interest in a plant in lake charles  louisiana 
nl also owns a slurry plant in lake charles  louisiana 
nl s fredrikstad tio plant has a lien on it that secures a claim by norwegian tax authorities  pending resolution of certain tax litigation kronos principal german operating subsidiary leases the land under its leverkusen tio production facility pursuant to a lease expiring in the leverkusen facility  with about one third of kronos tio production capacity  is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by bayer ag 
kronos is the only unrelated party so situated 
under a separate supplies and services agreement expiring in  bayer provides some raw materials  auxiliary and operating materials and utilities services necessary to operate the leverkusen facility 
both the lease and the supplies and services agreement restrict kronos ability to transfer ownership or use of the leverkusen facility 
all of kronos principal production facilities described above are owned  except for the land under the leverkusen facility 
kronos has a governmental concession with an unlimited term to operate its ilmenite mine in norway 
in late march nl suffered a fire at its german tio production facility in leverkusen 
due to the fire and the abrupt shutdown  damages to the  metric ton sulfate process portion of the facility are expected to be extensive and may require the rebuilding of the plant 
the fire did not enter the  metric ton chloride process plant at the site in leverkusen  but the fire did damage certain support equipment necessary to operate that plant 
the chloride process plant has been closed as damage to the support facilities is assessed  with start up preliminarily estimated to occur in may nl has under lease various corporate and administrative offices located in the us and various sales offices located in the us  france  the netherlands  denmark and the uk employees 
as of december   nl employed approximately  persons  excluding the joint venture employees  with approximately employees in the united states and approximately  at sites outside the united states 
hourly employees in production facilities worldwide  including the tio manufacturing joint venture  are represented by a variety of labor unions  with labor agreements having various expiration dates 
nl believes its labor relations are good 
regulatory and environmental matters 
certain of nl s businesses are and have been engaged in the handling  manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws 
as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  certain past and current operations and products of nl have the potential to cause environmental or other damage 
nl has implemented and continues to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks 
the policy of nl is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all its facilities and to strive to improve its environmental performance 
it is possible that future developments  such as stricter requirements of environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder  could adversely affect nl s production  handling  use  storage  transportation  sale or disposal of such substances as well as nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
nl s us manufacturing operations are governed by federal environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations  principally the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the occupational safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the toxic substances control act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act cercla  as well as the state counterparts of these statutes 
nl believes the louisiana plant owned and operated by the joint venture and a slurry facility owned by nl are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of these laws or compliance orders issued thereunder 
nl has no other us plants 
from time to time  nl s facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under such statutes 
resolution of such matters typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution may result in the payment of penalties  but to date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
nl s european and canadian production facilities operate in an environmental regulatory framework in which governmental authorities typically are granted broad discretionary powers which allow them to issue operating permits required for the plants to operate 
nl believes that all its plants are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
while the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in europe vary from country to country  a common regulatory denominator is provided by the european union the eu 
germany and belgium are members of the eu and follow its initiatives 
norway  although not a member  generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the eu 
nl believes that kronos is in substantial compliance with agreements reached with european regulatory authorities and with an eu directive to control the effluents produced by tio production facilities 
nl has a contract with a third party to treat certain effluents of its german sulfate process plants 
either party may terminate the contract after giving four years advance notice with regard to its nordenham  germany plant 
under certain circumstances  kronos may terminate the contract after giving six months notice with respect to treatment of effluents from the leverkusen  germany plant 
nl completed in an million landfill expansion for its belgian plant which is expected to provide the plant with twenty years of storage space for neutralized chloride process solids 
nl s capital expenditures related to its ongoing environmental protection and improvement programs are currently expected to be approximately million in and million in nl has been named as a defendant  potentially responsible party prp  or both  pursuant to cercla and similar state laws in approximately governmental and private actions associated with waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  or its subsidiaries  or their predecessors  certain of which are on the us environmental protection agency s us epa superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
lead pigment litigation 
nl was formerly involved in the manufacture of lead pigments for use in paint and lead based paint 
nl has been named as a defendant or third party defendant in various legal proceedings alleging that nl and other manufacturers are responsible for personal injury  property damage and governmental expenditures allegedly associated with the use of lead pigments 
nl is vigorously defending such litigation 
considering nl s previous involvement in the lead pigment and lead based paint businesses  there can be no assurance that additional litigation  similar to that described below  will not be filed 
in this regard  nl is aware that the city council of the city of milwaukee  wisconsin has authorized the filing of litigation against the former lead pigment manufacturers 
while the suit has not yet been filed  nl believes that the suit may seek to recover the medical costs associated with diagnosing and treating children who have been exposed to lead and the cost of abating lead based paint in the city s public housing 
in addition  various legislation and administrative regulations have  from time to time  been enacted or proposed that seek to a impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead based paint with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and b effectively overturn court decisions in which nl and other pigment manufacturers have been successful 
examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage  and bills which would revive actions barred by the statute of limitations 
while no legislation or regulations have been enacted to date which are expected to have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  the imposition of market share liability or other legislation could have such an effect 
nl has not accrued any amounts for the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation is without merit 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
in and the housing authority of new orleans hano filed third party complaints for indemnity and or contribution against nl  other alleged manufacturers of lead pigment together with nl  the pigment manufacturers and the lead industries association the lia in actions commenced by residents of hano units seeking compensatory and punitive damages for injuries allegedly caused by lead pigment 
the actions  which were pending in the civil district court for the parish of orleans  state of louisiana  were dismissed by the district court in subsequently  hano agreed to consolidate all the cases and appealed 
in march the louisiana court of appeals  fourth circuit  dismissed hano s appeal as untimely with respect to three of these cases 
with respect to the other cases included in the appeal  the court of appeals reversed the lower court decision dismissing the cases 
these cases were remanded to the district court for further proceedings 
in november the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment in one of the remaining cases and in june the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment in several of the remaining cases

the complaint seeks joint and several liability for compensatory and punitive damages from more than manufacturers and retailers of lead pigment and or paint  including nl  on behalf of adult residents of mississippi who were allegedly exposed to lead during their employment in construction and repair activities 
the complaint asserts strict liability  negligence  fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation  and medical monitoring claims 
nl intends to deny all allegations of wrongdoing and liability 
nl believes that the foregoing lead pigment actions are without merit and intends to continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing and liability and to defend such actions vigorously 
nl has filed actions seeking declaratory judgment and other relief against various insurance carriers with respect to costs of defense and indemnity coverage for certain of its environmental and lead pigment litigation 
nl industries  inc v 
commercial union insurance cos  et al  nos 
 hls district court of new jersey 
the action relating to lead pigment litigation defense costs filed in may against commercial union insurance company commercial union sought to recover defense costs incurred in the city of new york lead pigment case and two other cases which have since been resolved in nl s favor 
the action relating to lead paint litigation defense costs has been settled 
nl has also settled insurance coverage claims concerning environmental claims with certain of the defendants in the new jersey environmental coverage litigation  including nl s principal former carriers  as more fully described below 
the settled claims are to be dismissed from the new jersey litigation in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreements 
nl also continues to negotiate with several other insurance carriers with respect to possible settlement of claims that are being asserted in the new jersey environmental litigation  although there can be no assurance that settlement agreements can be reached with these other carriers 
other than granting motions for summary judgment brought by two excess liability insurance carriers  which contended that their policies contained absolute pollution exclusion language  and certain summary judgment motions regarding policy periods and ruling regarding choice of law issues  the court has not made any final rulings on defense costs or indemnity coverage with respect to nl s pending environmental litigation 
nor has the court made any final ruling on indemnity coverage in the lead pigment litigation 
no trial dates have been set 
other than rulings to date  the issue of whether insurance coverage for defense costs or indemnity or both will be found to exist depends upon a variety of factors  and there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will exist in other cases 
nl has not considered any potential insurance recoveries for lead pigment or environmental litigation in determining related accruals 
environmental matters and litigation 
nl has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  pursuant to cercla and similar state laws in approximately governmental and private actions associated with waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  or its subsidiaries  or their predecessors  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
these proceedings seek cleanup costs  damages for personal injury or property damage  and or damages for injury to natural resources 
certain of these proceedings involve claims for substantial amounts 
although nl may be jointly and severally liable for such costs  in most cases it is only one of a number of prps who may also be jointly and severally liable 
the extent of cercla liability cannot accurately be determined until the remedial investigation and feasibility study rifs is complete  the us epa issues a record of decision and costs are allocated among prps 
the extent of liability under analogous state cleanup statutes and for common law equivalents are subject to similar uncertainties 
nl believes it has provided adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs for cercla matters and other environmental liabilities 
at december   nl had accrued million for those environmental matters which are reasonably estimable 
nl determines the amount of accrual on a quarterly basis by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs to nl 
such costs include  among other things  expenditures for remedial investigations  monitoring  managing  studies  certain legal fees  cleanup  removal and remediation 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
nl has estimated that the upper end of the range of reasonably possible costs to nl for sites for which it is possible to estimate costs is approximately million 
nl s estimate of such liability has not been discounted to present value and nl has not reduced its accruals for any potential insurance recoveries 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed either accrued amounts or the upper end of the range for sites for which estimates have been made  and no assurance can be given that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no estimate presently can be made 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  new developments or changes with respect to site cleanup costs or allocation of such costs among prps  or a determination that nl is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated by nl to be required for such matters 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future 
more detailed descriptions of certain legal proceedings relating to environmental matters are set forth below 
in june nl recognized a million net gain from a settlement with one of the two principal former insurance carriers  and in december nl recognized a million net gain from a settlement with certain members of the other principal former insurance carrier 
the settlement gains are stated net of million in commissions  and the gross settlement proceeds of million were transferred by the carriers to special purpose trusts established to pay future remediation and other environmental expenditures of nl 
a settlement with remaining members of the second carrier group was reached in january  and nl expects to recognize a million gain in the first quarter of the settlements resolved court proceedings that nl initiated to seek reimbursement for legal defense expenditures and indemnity coverage for certain of its environmental remediation expenditures

regulatory and environmental matters regulatory and environmental matters for timet and nl are discussed in their respective business sections contained elsewhere herein and in item legal proceedings 
the company entered into a voluntary settlement agreement in july with the arkansas department of environmental quality and certain other potentially responsible parties prps pursuant to which the company and the other prps will undertake certain investigatory and remediation activities at a former mining site located in hot spring county  arkansas 
the company currently believes it has accrued adequate amounts to cover its share of the costs for such investigatory and remediation activities 
the company believes that to the extent it has any additional liability for remediation at this site  it is only one of a number of apparently solvent prps that would ultimately share in any such costs 
as of december   the company had accrued approximately million related to these matters 
the company records liabilities related to environmental remediation obligations when estimated future expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by the company at its non operating facilities  or a determination that the company is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites  could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known or where no estimate can presently be made 
further  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future

the results of operations of timet and nl  and the company s equity therein  are discussed below 
equity in earnings of other joint ventures consist principally of real estate development earnings of treco  which can fluctuate from period to period 
corporate expenses  net 
tremont s corporate expenses  net for and consist primarily of expenses related to intercorporate service agreements and opeb 
tremont s corporate expenses  net for include expenses related to intercorporate service agreements and opeb primarily offset by million of interest earned on short term investments and a 
million gain for cash received related to an investment that had previously been written off 
interest expense 
interest expense was higher in than due to slightly higher average borrowings under the company s advance agreement with contran and higher interest rates 
interest expense increased in over due to higher average borrowings 
the company expects interest expense in to be higher than due to higher interest rates under the company s new revolving loan entered into in february see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the company s income tax rate in varied from the us statutory rate principally because the company did not recognize a deferred tax asset with respect to its equity in losses of timet  which asset the company believes does not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition  income taxes are provided on the company s equity in earnings of nl at less than the statutory tax rate because a portion of such earnings are taxed at a preferential rate to the extent the company receives dividends from nl 
the company s income tax rate in varied from the us statutory rate principally due to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to the recognition of a deductible difference associated with affiliates not included in the consolidated tax group that previously did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the variance in rates in was due to a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to a net decrease in the basis differences related to the company s investment in nl 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s federal income tax return has been examined by the internal revenue service irs  and the irs has proposed additional tax deficiencies of million 
the company is appealing the proposed deficiencies and believes they are substantially without merit 
no assurances can be given that these tax matters will be resolved in the company s favor in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in tax proceedings 
the company believes that it has provided adequate accruals for additional taxes which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
effective january   the company and nl will be included in the consolidated united states federal income tax return of contran the contran tax group 
as a member of the contran tax group  the company is a party to a tax sharing agreement the contran tax agreement 
the contran tax agreement provides that the company compute its provision for us income taxes on a separate company basis using the tax elections made by contran 
pursuant to the contran tax agreement  and using the tax elections made by contran  the company will make payments to or receive payments from valhi in amounts it would have paid to or received from the irs had it not been a member of the contran tax group 
refunds are limited to amounts previously paid under the contran tax agreement 
as discussed below  the company expects to report equity in losses of timet in the company s effective income tax rate in is expected to vary from the us statutory rate because tremont does not currently expect that recognizing a deferred income tax asset with respect to such equity in losses will be appropriate under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
also  as a member of the contran tax group with nl  the company will provide taxes on the company s equity in earnings of nl at less than the statutory tax rate because a portion of such earnings will be tax free to the extent the company receives dividends from nl 
other 
tremont periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  principally its investments in nl and timet  to determine if there has been any decline in value that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a writedown which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
the company s per share net carrying amount of its investment in nl at december  was per share  compared to a per share market price of at that date 
at december   after considering what the company believes to be all relevant factors including  among other things  timet s operating results  financial position  estimated asset values and prospects  the company recorded a million pre tax non cash charge million net of tax to earnings to reduce the net carrying value of its investment in timet for an other than temporary impairment in its market value 
in determining the amount of the impairment charge  the company considered  among other things  recent ranges of timet s stock price and current estimates of timet s future operating losses which would further reduce the company s net carrying value of its investment in timet as it records additional equity in losses 
at december   the company s per share net carrying amount of its investment in timet was per share  compared to a per share market price of at that date 
while generally accepted accounting principles may require an investment in a security accounted for by the equity method to be written down if the market value of that security declines  they do not permit a writeup if the market value subsequently recovers 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate its interests in nl and timet based upon  among other things  their respective results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and business outlook 
in the event tremont determines that any further decline in value of its interests below their net carrying value has occurred which is other than temporary  it would report an appropriate writedown at that time 
timet the company s equity in timet s earnings losses differs from the amount that would be expected by applying tremont s december  ownership percentage to timet s separately reported earnings because of changes in tremont s level of ownership of timet and because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in timet and amortization with respect to the other than temporary impairment charge discussed above 
amortization of such basis differences in timet generally increases earnings  and decreases losses  attributable to timet as reported by tremont 
the information included below relating to the financial position  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of timet has been summarized from reports filed with the commission by timet file no

the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately of us and to of worldwide titanium mill product consumption 
accordingly  the aerospace industry has a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium metals industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
timet estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products peaked in at approximately  metric tons 
industry mill product shipments subsequently declined approximately in to an estimated  metric tons  with a further decline to an estimated  metric tons in and timet expects that worldwide industry mill product shipments will increase in by approximately to about  metric tons 
the expected increase is primarily attributable to stronger demand resulting from an increase in forecasted commercial aircraft build rates as well as a decrease in the amount of excess titanium inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain 
mill product shipments to the aerospace industry in represented about of total industry demand and about of timet s annual mill product shipments 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components ie blades  discs  rings and engine cases and air frame components ie bulkheads  tail sections  landing gears  wing supports and fasteners can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
industry shipments of mill products to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of aerospace demand and of aggregate titanium mill product demand 
timet believes that demand for mill products for the commercial aerospace sector will be the principal driver of the expected increase in industry mill product shipments during demand growth for these markets and sectors is expected to exceed the aggregate growth in titanium mill product shipments while other markets are expected to experience lesser growth 
shipments to the commercial aerospace sector represented approximately of timet s sales volume in accordingly  timet believes its sales volume in may increase more than the expected increase in titanium industry mill product shipments 
the present business environment is substantially different from that in to during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
this resulted in considerable excess inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain 
during  aerospace customers continued to focus on reducing inventories and a significant number of timet s aerospace customers canceled or delayed previously scheduled orders 
the aerospace supply chain is fragmented and decentralized making it difficult to quantify excess inventories 
however  customer actions such as order delays ie pushouts and cancellations combined with other data provide limited visibility 
during  timet experienced no significant customer pushouts or cancellations of deliveries 
late in and early  timet experienced an increase in orders for aerospace quality titanium products and certain customers requested advanced delivery of existing orders and its order backlog increased substantially 
although quantitative information is not readily available  these factors and others lead timet to believe that the excess titanium inventory throughout the supply chain has been substantially reduced and is unlikely to be a significant factor in in most areas 
timet s order backlog increased to approximately million at december  from million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during timet announced selling price increases on new orders for certain grades of titanium products  principally aerospace quality products  late in and early in the announced price increases ranged from to while the announced price increases ranged from to 
the price changes were intended to reflect increases in certain manufacturing costs  including raw materials and energy  as well as timet s need to improve financial performance 
the price increases did not apply to certain industrial products or to orders under ltas and other agreements with customers that contain specific provisions governing selling prices 
accordingly  about of timet s annual sales are expected to be eligible for these price increases 
several other titanium companies have also recently announced price increases  particularly for aerospace quality titanium products 
actual selling price increases are subject to negotiations with customers and may differ materially from announced increases 
outlook 
the outlook section contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
see note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies regarding commitments  contingencies  legal  environmental and other matters of timet  which information is incorporated herein by reference and may affect timet s future results of operations or liquidity 
sales revenue in is expected to approximate million  reflecting the combined effects of increased sales volume  price increases on certain products and changes in product mix 
timet expects its mill products sales volume to increase to in compared to levels  while melted product sales volume is expected to remain near levels 
timet believes its mill products sales volume may grow more than the forecasted increase in titanium industry shipments because the proportion of timet s sales to the commercial aerospace sector approximately of timet s sales exceeds the total industry mill product shipments to that sector approximately of industry mill shipments 
demand growth for the commercial aerospace sector is expected to exceed the aggregate growth in titanium industry shipments of mill products while other markets and sectors are expected to experience lesser growth 
selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual currency exchange rates during the respective periods on aerospace product shipments  while difficult to forecast  are expected to rise gradually during however  the recently announced price increases are expected to principally affect the second half of due to associated product lead times 
average selling prices per kilogram  as reported by timet  reflect the net effects of changes in selling prices  currency exchange rates  customer and product mix 
accordingly  average selling prices are not necessarily indicative of any one factor 
timet s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including  among others  customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor and energy costs 
restructuring  asset impairments and other special charges have occurred in the past and may occur in the future causing operating results to vary from expectations 
gross margins as a percent of sales are presently expected to increase over the year  however  energy and other cost increases could substantially offset expected realized selling price increases in timet is experiencing increases in energy costs as a result of recent increases in natural gas and electricity prices in the us the largest portion of the cost increases are presently associated with electrical power at timet s henderson  nevada facility where titanium sponge is produced and melted 
timet purchases electricity from both hydro and fossil fuel sources with hydropower being substantially less costly 
timet purchases fossil fuel power to supplement its electricity needs above the amount it can buy from hydro sources 
as timet increases production rates during at its nevada facility  more fossil fuel power is required as a percentage of total power consumed 
energy costs in comprised about of timet s cost of sales 
energy costs may fluctuate substantially from period to period and may adversely affect timet s gross margins causing actual results to differ significantly from expected amounts 
in march  timet was notified by one of its customers that a product manufactured from standard grade titanium produced by timet contained what has been confirmed to be a tungsten inclusion 
timet believes that the source of this tungsten was contaminated silicon purchased from an outside vendor in the silicon was used as an alloying addition to the titanium at the melting stage 
timet is currently investigating the possible scope of this problem  including an evaluation of the identities of customers who received material manufactured using this silicon and the applications to which such material has been placed by such customers 
at the present time  timet is aware of only a single ingot that has been demonstrated to contain tungsten inclusions  however  further investigation may identify other material that has been similarly affected 
until this investigation is completed  timet is unable to determine the possible remedial steps that may be required and whether timet might incur any material liability with respect to this matter 
timet currently believes that it is unlikely that its insurance policies will provide coverage for any costs that may be associated with this matter 
however  timet currently intends to seek full recovery from the silicon supplier for any liability timet might incur in this matter  although no assurances can be given that timet will ultimately be able to recover all or any portion of such amounts 
at december   timet had not recorded any liability related to this matter 
the amount of liability timet may ultimately incur related to this matter is not reasonably estimable at this time 
in march  timet was notified that certain workers at cezus plant in ugine  france were engaged in a work slowdown related to wage and benefit issues 
cezus performs certain melting and forging operations on a contract basis for timet savoie 
while this slowdown may adversely impact shipments by timet savoie to its customers in the near term  based upon timet s current understanding of the situation  timet does not presently anticipate that this action will have a material adverse effect on its business or operations 
depreciation and amortization expense for is expected to approximate levels 
timet intends to maintain selling  general  administrative  and development costs relatively constant as a percent of sales  however  this is dependent on  among other things  how the business cycle develops 
interest expense and minority interest expense on timet s convertible preferred securities in is also expected to approximate levels for the full year 
timet s effective consolidated tax benefit rate in should approximate the us statutory rate 
however  timet operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income loss can impact timet s overall effective tax rate 
for financial reporting purposes  timet has recognized the tax benefit of substantially all of its net operating loss carryforwards  and expects that tax benefits to be recognized during will principally be deferred income tax benefits with some cash income tax payments expected in certain foreign jurisdictions 
timet periodically reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets to determine whether future realization is more likely than not 
based on such periodic reviews  timet could record an additional valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets in the future 
timet presently expects to report both an operating loss and a net loss in  however  timet believes the losses in will be substantially reduced from levels 
timet expects to generate positive cash flow from operations in  but at levels substantially reduced from receivables and inventory levels are expected to increase in to support the anticipated increase in sales whereas both receivables and inventories decreased in timet presently intends to continue to defer dividends on its convertible preferred securities during timet may consider resuming the payment of dividends on the convertible preferred securities or purchase the securities if the outlook for timet s operating results improves substantially or a favorable result in the boeing related litigation is achieved  or both 
dividends on timet s common stock are prohibited under timet s us credit agreement 
capital spending for is currently expected to be million  covering principally capacity enhancements  capital maintenance  and safety and environmental projects 
net debt is expected to increase in as compared to year end levels 
at december   timet had approximately million of borrowing availability under its various worldwide credit agreements

year ended december  in millions net sales operating income loss percent change in mill product sales volume mill product selling prices melted product sales volume melted product selling prices change expressed in us dollars net sales and operating loss compared to sales of mill products in declined from million in to million in this decrease is due to a decline in mill product selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  a less than decrease in sales volume  and changes in product mix 
in billing currencies which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation  mill product selling prices declined from melted product sales increased from million in to million in due to the net effects of a increase in melted product sales volume  a decline in melted product selling prices and changes in product mix 
the decrease in the selling prices was principally due to greater price competition in timet s non lta business 
early in  timet implemented a plan to address then current market and operating conditions  which resulted in the recognition of a net million restructuring charge in the restructuring charge is included in the operating loss of the titanium melted and mill products segment and is principally related to personnel severance and benefits for the approximately employees terminated as part of the restructuring 
additionally  timet recorded net special charges of million  consisting of million of equipment related impairment charges  million of environmental remediation charges  a special income item of million related to the termination of timet s agreement to sell titanium sponge to union titanium sponge corporation  and the million gain on the sale of timet s castings joint venture 
total cost of sales in was of sales compared to in the increase in the percentage is principally the result of lower average selling prices and a shift in product mix  partially offset by lower raw material costs and lower operating expenses 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses decreased in compared to principally due to the impact of the restructuring plan implemented in early as well as reduced expenses related to the business enterprise information system project that was completed in early and year computer systems expenses which were incurred in but not equity in earnings losses of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment in decreased by million from principally due to the decline in earnings of valtimet  timet s owned welded tube joint venture 
sales and operating income compared to the titanium melted and mill product segment net sales in decreased compared to primarily due to a decrease in mill products shipment volume resulting primarily from reduced demand in the aerospace market 
mill product selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods for were approximately lower than reflecting both the price effect of long term agreements and increased price competition on non lta business 
in billing currencies  mill product selling prices declined from timet produced approximately million of titanium ingots in  for which the customer was billed but income recognition was deferred 
approximately of this material was shipped in the decrease in net sales of the other segment is a result of timet s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july total cost of sales in was of sales compared to in the increase in the percentage is a result of the lower selling prices  lower production volumes  higher depreciation  and increased reserves for slow moving inventory 
yield  rework and deviated material costs were also higher and plant operating rates were lower 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses in were lower than in dollar terms due in large part to the completion of the implementation of the initial phase of timet s business enterprise system during the first half of these costs as a percentage of sales  however  increased to approximately primarily due to the decline in sales 
in the fourth quarter of  timet recorded million of special charges consisting of million of restructuring charges and million of write downs associated with timet s investment in certain start up joint ventures 
during the same quarter  timet also recorded a million charge to cost of sales for slow moving inventory 
approximately half of the restructuring charges were non cash  primarily related to the disposition of a germany subsidiary  with the cash component relating to the termination of people 
the million charge for slow moving inventory and million of the million of special charges are included in the operating loss of the titanium melted and mill products segment in operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million 
operating losses of the other segment included million and million of special charges in and  respectively 
equity in earnings losses of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment decreased by million from principally due to the decline in earnings of valtimet 
equity in losses of the other segment were higher in due to timet recording a higher share of the losses for a full year in as a result of increased ownership in certain of these ventures in mid other income  net 
other income  net  consists of the following in thousands dividend and interest income    general corporate income expense  net  other  in and  dividends and interest income consisted principally of dividends on million of non voting preferred securities of special metals corporation  which were purchased by timet in october in  the amount represented primarily earnings on corporate cash equivalents 
general corporate income expense consisted principally of currency transaction gains losses 
in  net currency losses of million were offset by a million gain on the sale of timet s castings joint venture 
in  other income consisted principally of million received from utsc in connection with the termination of the sponge purchase agreement between timet and utsc 
european operations 
timet has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom  with smaller operations in france  italy and germany 
titanium is a worldwide market and the factors influencing timet s us and european operations are substantially the same 
approximately of timet s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound and european currencies tied to the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge and alloys  for timet s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of timet s european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  thus  the us dollar value of these subsidiaries sales and costs denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  including sales and costs denominated in us dollars  are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
borrowings of timet s european operations may be in us dollars or in functional currencies 
timet s export sales from the us are denominated in us dollars and as such are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
timet does not use currency contracts to hedge its currency exposures 
net currency transaction gains losses included in earnings were losses of million and million in and  respectively  and a 
million gain in at december   consolidated assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies were approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of u 
s 
dollar cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and borrowings 
exchange rates among european currencies including the french franc  italian lira and german mark  but excluding the british pound became fixed relative to each other as a result of the implementation of the euro effective in costs associated with modifications of systems to handle euro denominated transactions are not expected to be significant 
interest expense 
interest expense for increased over due to the net effect of increased interest rates related to us credit facilities entered into in early  lower average borrowings outstanding during the year and a lower level of capitalized interest 
interest expense for more than doubled from the levels of primarily due to higher levels of average debt and increased interest rates 
also contributing to the higher comparative interest expense was a lower level of interest capitalized in compared to as major capital projects were completed 
income taxes 
timet operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income loss can impact timet s overall effective tax rate 
for financial reporting purposes  timet has recognized the tax benefit of substantially all of its net operating loss carryforwards  and expects that tax benefits to be recognized during will be deferred income tax benefits 
timet expects to make some cash income tax payments in certain foreign jurisdictions in minority interest 
annual dividend expense related to timet s convertible preferred securities approximates million and is reported as minority interest net of allocable income taxes 
other minority interest relates primarily to the interest in timet savoie held by cezus

nl industries the company s interest in nl is reported by the equity method 
valhi and tremont together may be deemed to control nl 
the information included below relating to the financial position  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of nl has been summarized from reports filed with the commission by nl file no 
 which reports contain more detailed information concerning nl  including complete financial statements on nl s historical basis of accounting 
tremont s equity in earnings of nl differs from the amount that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to nl s separately reported earnings  because of changes in tremont s level of ownership of nl in and the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in nl 
amortization of such basis differences generally reduces earnings  and increases losses  attributable to nl as reported by tremont

as discussed below  average tio selling prices in billing currencies increased in and slightly decreased in compared to the prior year 
kronos operating income increased million in and declined million in gross profit margins were in  in and in many factors influence tio pricing levels  including i industry capacity  ii worldwide demand growth  iii customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions and iv relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates

percent change in tio sales volume mt in thousands average selling prices in billing currencies kronos operating income for was higher than due to higher average tio selling prices in billing currencies and higher production and sales volumes 
kronos operating income in was lower than  primarily due to lower average tio selling prices and lower production volume  partially offset by higher sales volume 
average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation during were higher than in with higher prices in all major regions with the greatest improvement being realized in the european and export markets 
pigment prices increased from the preceding quarter during each quarter of  continuing the upward trend that began in the fourth quarter of the rate of price increases slowed in the fourth quarter to over the third quarter of  and prices at the end of the fourth quarter of were slightly lower than the average for the quarter 
since prices began to increase in the fourth quarter of  prices have increased an aggregate of in europe and in north america over the five quarter period 
average tio selling prices in were lower than with higher prices in north america offset by lower prices in europe and export markets 
record sales volume of  metric tons of tio in was higher than  primarily due to higher sales in europe and north america 
kronos sales volume in the fourth quarter of decreased from the record fourth quarter of approximately one half of kronos tio sales volume was attributable to markets in europe with approximately attributable to north america  and the balance to other regions 
sales volume in was higher than with growth in all major regions 
industry wide demand was strong for the first half of  before moderating in the second half of and early demand in the second half of and the first three quarters of was stronger than comparable year earlier periods as a result of  among other things  customers buying in advance of anticipated price increases 
demand softened in the fourth quarter of nl s record production volume of  metric tons in was higher than the  metric tons produced in operating rates were near full capacity in compared to in kronos production volume in was lower than the  metric tons produced in with operating rates near full capacity in production volume was curtailed in the beginning of the first quarter of in order to manage inventory levels 
finished goods inventory levels increased in the fourth quarter of and at the end of represent about two months of sales 
nl s efforts to debottleneck kronos production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
nl expects kronos production capacity of  metric tons at the end of will be increased to approximately  metric tons during  primarily at its chloride facilities  with moderate capital expenditures 
such expectations about nl s future tio production capacity excludes the effect  if any  resulting from a fire that occurred at one of nl s german tio production facilities discussed below 
on march   nl suffered a fire at its leverkusen  germany  metric ton sulfate process tio facility 
no employees were injured nor was there any environmental damage 
due to the fire and the abrupt shutdown  damages to the sulfate plant are expected to be extensive and may require the rebuilding of the sulfate process plant 
the fire did not enter the  metric ton chloride process tio plant at the leverkusen site  but the fire did damage certain support equipment necessary to operate the chloride process plant 
the chloride process plant has been closed while damage to the surrounding support facility is assessed  with start up of the chloride process plant currently estimated to occur in may 
nl anticipates that the loss will be covered by property and business interruption insurance  but the effect on nl s financial results on a quarter to quarter or a year to year basis will depend on the timing and amount of insurance recoveries 
based on the information currently available to nl  nl believes the impact of the fire on its financial results for the entire year of will be small  and should not exceed million to nl 
industry demand in is expected to heavily depend upon worldwide economic conditions 
nl believes sales and production volumes should approximate levels 
the price increase that was originally scheduled for october in north america has not been implemented due to market forces 
nl recently announced a european price increase of euro per metric ton scheduled to be implemented late in the first quarter of nl believes that its average prices will approximate its average prices 
the extent to which kronos can realize these or other price increases in will depend on market conditions 
excluding the effect of a fire discussed above that nl suffered in late march at one of its facilities  kronos expects its operating income in the first quarter of will be comparable to the first quarter of operating income for the balance of will depend on worldwide economic conditions 
if the economy continues to soften  selling prices and sales volume could be lower than expected and full year operating income would likely be below levels factoring in higher anticipated costs  particularly energy 
however  if demand strengthens later in the year nl should be able to realize price increases 
kronos believes this could put its operating income closer to or above the level 
nl s expectations as to the future prospects of nl and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond nl s control  including continued worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the market place  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions  technological advances and the ultimate effect of a fire nl suffered in late march at one of its german tio production facilities as discussed above 
if actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s performance could be unfavorably affected 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which reduced nl s expenses in both and compared to the year earlier periods  kronos cost of sales in was lower than primarily due to lower unit costs  which resulted primarily from higher production levels 
kronos cost of sales in was higher than due to higher sales volume and higher unit costs  which resulted primarily from lower production levels 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of higher average selling prices and lower unit costs  and increased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of lower average selling prices and higher unit costs 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which reduced nl s expense in both and compared to the year earlier periods  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  excluding corporate expenses  increased in from the year earlier period primarily due to higher variable compensation expense and higher selling and distribution expenses associated with higher sales volumes

nl has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  norway  belgium and canada 
nl s non us sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses expressed in us dollars 
a significant amount of nl s sales in are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily a stronger us dollar compared to the euro  decreased sales by million and million during and  respectively  compared to the year earlier period 
when translated to us dollars using currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average selling prices for decreased from kronos average selling prices in us dollars for decreased from the effect of the stronger us dollar on kronos operating costs that are not denominated in us dollars reduced operating costs in and compared to the respective prior year 
in addition  sales to export markets are typically denominated in us dollars and a stronger us dollar improves margins on these sales at nl s non us subsidiaries 
the favorable margin on export sales tends to offset the unfavorable effect of translating local currency profits to us dollars when the dollar is stronger 
as a result  the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income in and  excluding the million foreign currency transaction gain  was not significant when compared to the year earlier periods 
general corporate 
corporate interest and dividend income  including noncash interest income on restricted cash balances  fluctuate in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
average funds invested in were higher than primarily due to the increase in restricted cash related to the million litigation settlement in july average funds invested in were lower than primarily due to the repayment of certain of nl s debt in the last half of securities gains  net in includes a second quarter million securities gain related to common stock received from the demutualization of an insurance company from which nl had purchased certain insurance policies and a fourth quarter million noncash securities loss related to an other than temporary decline in value of certain available for sale securities held by nl

corporate expense in was higher than  primarily as a result of higher legal and environmental expenses 
nl expects corporate expense in will be slightly lower than primarily due to lower legal and environmental expenses 
interest expense in declined compared to primarily due to reduced levels of outstanding euro denominated debt 
interest expense in declined compared to due to the prepayment of nl s former deutsche mark bank credit facility in and prepayments of outstanding indebtedness in  principally the senior secured discount notes  a joint venture term loan and a portion of nl s former dm bank credit facility 
assuming no significant change in interest rates  interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to i lower levels of outstanding indebtedness and ii lower average interest rates as a result of the december refinancing of million of nl s high fixed rate public debt with lower variable rate bank debt

a reduction in the german base income tax rate from to  enacted in october  became effective january  the reduction in the german income tax rate resulted in million of additional deferred income tax expense in the fourth quarter of due to a reduction of nl s deferred income tax asset related to certain german tax attributes 
nl does not expect its future current income tax expense to be affected by the rate change in germany 
certain of nl s tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions are being examined and tax authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies  including interest 
nl has received tax assessments from the norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies including related interest of approximately nok million million at december  relating to and nl is currently litigating the primary issue related to the assessment and in february the norwegian appeals court ruled in favor of the norwegian tax authorities

on a quarterly basis  nl evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant  including sites for which ems has contractually assumed nl s obligation 
nl believes it has adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but nl s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
nl is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and paint litigation is without merit 
nl has not accrued any amounts for such pending litigation

there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
foreign operations 
as discussed above  nl has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar

as of january   the functional currency of nl s german  belgian  dutch and french operations have been converted to the euro from their respective national currencies 
nl has assessed and evaluated the impact of the euro conversion on its business and made the necessary system conversions 
the euro conversion may impact nl s operations including  among other things  changes in product pricing decisions necessitated by cross border price transparencies 
such changes in product pricing decisions could impact both selling prices and purchasing costs and  consequently  favorably or unfavorably impact results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

nl is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december   nl s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings fixed rate and variable rate 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates  for nl s aggregate indebtedness at december  and at december  and  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars  and all outstanding variable rate indebtedness was denominated in either euros or norwegian kroner

the fair value of such equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million and million  respectively 
other 
nl believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical affect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect nl s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for nl s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses nl would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by nl of future events  gains or losses
