overview we are a leading multi jurisdictional gaming company that owns and operates casinos and related hotel  food and beverage  entertainment and other facilities 
on december   we acquired substantially all the assets of two gaming and entertainment facilities located in kansas city  missouri and st 
charles  missouri from subsidiaries of station casinos  inc on january   in a separate transaction  we sold substantially all the assets of the reserve hotel and casino  located in henderson  nevada  to a subsidiary of station casinos

see item business for additional information regarding our operating properties 
certain of the company s operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  in jackpot  the months of march through october are the strongest 
as a result  the second and third calendar quarters typically produce a disproportionate amount of the income from operations of the jackpot properties 
in addition  adverse weather conditions may adversely affect the business of the jackpot properties  and operations during the winter months typically vary from year to year based on the severity of the winter weather conditions in the northwestern united states 
to date  operations in iowa and missouri have experienced some seasonality  with the winter months being the slower periods 
to date  operations at both ameristar vicksburg and the reserve have not experienced any material seasonality 
our quarterly and annual operating results may be affected by competitive pressures  the timing of the commencement of new gaming operations  the amount of preopening costs incurred  charges associated with debt refinancing and or property acquisition and disposition transactions  construction at existing facilities and general weather conditions 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of results to be expected for future periods

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which we will adopt in the first quarter of because of our limited use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on a portion of our variable rate debt  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position

in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives 
eitf requires that discounts which result in a reduction in or refund of the selling price of a product or service in a single exchange transaction be recorded as a reduction of revenues 
we will adopt eitf in the second quarter of  including reclassifying prior period amounts for programs where we offer customers free plays or coupons for gaming activity 
the amount of free plays and coupons to date has not been significant 
our accounting policy related to free or discounted rooms  food and beverage and other services already complies with eitf in february  the eitf reached a partial consensus on eitf  accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future 
the consensus requires that vendors recognize the cash rebate or refund obligation associated with time or volume based cash rebates as a reduction of revenue based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cost of honoring rebates or refunds earned and claimed to each of the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer toward earning the rebate or refund 
the liability for such obligations should be based on the estimated amount of rebates or refunds to be ultimately earned  including an estimation of breakage if it can be reasonably estimated 
the consensus is applicable beginning in the first quarter of our players clubs allow customers to earn certain complimentary services and or cash rebates based on the volume of the customers gaming activity 
we currently account for our players clubs in accordance with eitf  except that we record the charge for progress towards the complimentary services cash rebates as a casino department expense instead of a reduction of revenue 
we will change the classification for these charges  which totaled million in the year ended december   in the first quarter of  including reclassifying prior period amounts
