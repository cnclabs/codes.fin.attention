provision for impairment of long lived assets in the regular course of business the company s restaurants are reviewed on an individual restaurant basis for indicators of impairment  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its restaurants may not be recoverable 
the company s primary test for an indicator of potential impairment is operating losses 
in order to determine whether impairment has occurred  the company estimates the future net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of its restaurants  and compares such estimated future cash flows to the respective carrying amounts 
those restaurants  which have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows  are deemed impaired 
the carrying value of these restaurants is adjusted to an estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows attributable to such restaurants using a discount rate equivalent to the rate of return the company expects to achieve from its investment in newly constructed restaurants 
the excess is charged to expense and cannot be reinstated 
considerable management judgment and certain significant assumptions are necessary to estimate future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions used by the company in evaluating its assets for impairment include  but may not be limited to estimations of future sales levels  costs of sales  direct and indirect costs of operating the assets  the length of time the assets will be utilized and the company s ability to utilize equipment  fixtures and other moveable long lived assets in other existing or future locations 
in addition  such estimates and assumptions include anticipated operating results related to certain profit improvement programs implemented by the company during  and  as well as the possible rent reductions  deferrals  and other negotiated concessions from landlords 
actual results could vary materially from management s estimates and assumptions and such variance could result in a change in the estimated recoverability of the company s long lived assets 
accordingly  the results of the changes in those estimates could have a material impact on the company s future results of operations and financial position 
during  the company recorded a  provision for impairment of long lived assets related to three locations 
during  the company recorded a  provision for impairment of long lived assets related to four locations  and during the company recorded a  provision for impairment of long lived assets related to one location 
in the normal course of business  management performs a regular review of the strength of its operating assets 
it is management s plan to continue to make such decisions to close under performing restaurants and or dispose of other assets it considers in the best long term interest of the company s shareholders

impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food and beverage products  labor and real estate can affect the company s operations 
over the past few years  inflation has had a lesser impact on the company s operations due to the lower rates of inflation in the nation s economy and the economic conditions in the company s market area 
management believes the company has historically been able to pass on increased costs through certain selected menu price increases and increased productivity and purchasing efficiencies  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
management anticipates that the average cost of restaurant real estate leases and construction costs could increase in the future which could affect the company s ability to expand
