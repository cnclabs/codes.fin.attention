this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the ratios and statistics contained elsewhere in the form k 
references will be found in this form k to the following transactions that have impacted or will impact peoples results of operations on april   peoples sold  through pebo capital trust i a newly formed subsidiary million of capital securities capital securities or trust preferred securities 
the proceeds were used by the pebo capital trust i to purchase  from peoples  junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due may  in late april  peoples invested million in peoples bank 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of a portion of peoples outstanding common shares 
on december   peoples announced approval to repurchase  shares or approximately of peoples outstanding common shares from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions stock repurchase program 
during  peoples repurchased approximately  common shares authorized under the stock repurchase program that expired on december  on january   peoples announced approval to repurchase  shares or approximately of peoples outstanding common shares from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions stock repurchase program 
the stock repurchase program will expire on december  the combination of the issuance of capital securities in and the stock repurchase programs has impacted and will continue to impact several key performance indicators of peoples future financial results 
the impact  where significant  is discussed in the applicable sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
overview of the income statement peoples had net income of  in  an increase of  or from  in on a diluted basis  earnings per share reached in  up or compared to the previous year 
peoples core earnings increased due to net interest income growth and non interest revenue enhancements 
return on average equity in totaled compared to in return on average assets was in compared to the previous year 
diluted cash earnings per share for the year ended december   was  up or from in diluted cash earnings per share in cash earnings removes the after tax impact of intangible amortization expense 
return on tangible assets decreased to in compared to in return on tangible assets is defined as cash earnings as a percentage of average total assets minus goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
return on tangible equity improved to in compared to last year 
return on tangible equity is defined as cash earnings as a percentage of average total stockholders equity minus goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
due to earning asset growth  net interest income in increased  or to  the provision for loan losses in totaled  an increase of  compared to as a result of increased loan volume  less favorable loss experience  and general economic slowdowns in peoples markets 
bolstered by growth in deposit account service charges and insurance and investment commissions  non interest income  excluding securities and asset disposal gains  increased  or to  in  peoples reported net gains on securities transactions of  compared to net losses of  in in  non interest expense increased  or to  in part as a result of investments designed to make financial services more convenient  flexible  and speedy for clients 
peoples has grown through acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions which results in the amortization expense related to intangibles and affects earnings per share as well as other performance ratios 
because of the impact of purchase accounting and the related intangible amortization expense on peoples results of operation  management also uses cash earnings  which removes the after tax impact of intangible amortization expense  to evaluate the impact of acquisitions on profitability and peoples return on its investment 
the discussion of cash earnings is also included in financial reporting to facilitate the comparison of peoples results of operations to competitors making acquisitions using pooling of interests accounting 
return on tangible assets and return on tangible equity removes the after tax impact of intangible amortization expense and the balance sheet impact of average intangibles 
in  intangible amortization expense totaled   after taxes compared to   after taxes last year 
due to amortization  average balance sheet intangibles decreased to million in compared to million in interest income and expense net interest income  the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  remains peoples primary source of revenue 
interest earning assets include loans and investment securities while interest bearing liabilities include interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
changes in market interest rates  as well as adjustments in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  impacted net interest income in increased net interest income in resulted from balance sheet growth  due to strong internal loan growth  and was the driving force behind peoples record profits 
net interest income grew to  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
total interest income reached  while interest expense totaled  in  peoples initiated an asset growth strategy to offset the costs to service the trust preferred securities  thereby leveraging peoples increased regulatory capital levels leverage strategy 
the leverage strategy increased peoples earnings asset base approximately million and was funded primarily by fhlb borrowings and other wholesale funding sources 
the leverage strategy was implemented throughout the second quarter of and was completed on june  while total asset levels were maintained and even grown in  most of the principal runoff from the investment portfolio was used to fund loan growth 
average total earning assets reached billion in  a million or increase over average loans  the largest earning asset component on peoples balance sheet  grew million or in due to the impact of peoples leverage strategy  peoples average balances of investment securities increased million from million in to million in included in interest income is  of tax exempt income from investments issued by and loans made to states and political subdivisions 
since these revenues are not taxed  it is more meaningful to analyze net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis 
the fte yield on earning assets was in  compared to in while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets and serves as a measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the mix and pricing of assets and liabilities from peoples balance sheet 
in  net interest margin was compared to in net interest margin decreased in due to interest rate compression between loan pricing and funding source costs  primarily as a result of rising interest rates on short term funding sources 
peoples reliance on short term funding has increased due to recent loan growth 
peoples management anticipates that net interest margin could continue to be pressured in early  although recent interest rate reductions by the federal reserve are expected to result in improved net interest margin later in the increase in peoples earning asset yield  which rose to in compared to in  is primarily attributable to the increase in peoples loan portfolio yield and the mix of loans as a percent of earning assets 
peoples also saw improvement in its investment portfolio yield  which increased basis points to in the largest dollar volume of interest bearing liabilities is deposits where interest costs increased basis points to in the most significant component of interest expense in was interest paid on time deposits certificates of deposits and individual retirement accounts 
in  peoples paid interest of  or  on average time deposit balances of million 
in  the average rate paid on time deposits was on balances of million 
the increased deposit costs in resulted from the upward repricing of the high dollar volume of peoples interest bearing customer funding sources such as certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
management expects deposit pricing to be increasingly competitive and continues to focus its efforts toward increasing balances in non interest bearing demand deposits  which grew  on average  million to million in average balances  and other lower cost deposit products 
in addition to core deposit growth  peoples continued to use a combination of short term and long term borrowings as funding sources to fuel loan growth in the cost of borrowed funds increased basis points to in costs of borrowed funds have increased due to recent rises in market interest rates as well as repricing of certain fhlb borrowings peoples cash management services  offered to a variety of business customers  have provided short term funding in the form of rate sensitive overnight repurchase agreements 
in  peoples average balances of these overnight repurchase agreements excluding balances of national market repurchase agreements available through wholesale funding sources increased million to million 
the average rate paid in on overnight repurchase agreements totaled  up basis points from the prior year s average rate of 
average total overnight repurchase agreements comprised a significant portion of peoples short term borrowings 
in late and continuing in  peoples accessed national market repurchase agreements in an effort to diversify peoples short term funding sources as well as take advantage of marginally attractive short term financing rates 
national market repurchase agreements averaged million in at an average rate of compared to million and an average rate of in peoples also continued to use short term fhlb advances to fund its earning assets in average short term fhlb balances increased from million in to in interest costs on these short term borrowings grew to  at an average rate of  compared to  at an average rate of  in management will continue to use short term fhlb borrowings as a funding source for earning assets when appropriate 
long term borrowing costs  which represent the largest average volume of borrowed fund costs  also increased compared to the rate paid on average long term borrowings totaled in  up basis points compared to in the majority of peoples long term borrowings are fixed rate fhlb borrowings with a call feature 
management plans to maintain access to long term fhlb borrowings  with appropriate repricing characteristics  as a funding source 
provision for loan losses in  peoples recorded a provision for loan losses of  compared to s expense of  the provision is based upon management s continuing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and is reflective of the volume concentrations  quality of the portfolio  and overall management assessment of the inherent credit risk 
as a result of continuing anticipated loan growth  trends in losses and delinquencies  and recent slowdowns affecting the economy  management anticipates that loan loss provision will increase in the first quarter of compared to recent quarterly expense of  loan loss provision after the first quarter of will be dependent on loan delinquencies  portfolio risk  overall loan growth  general economic conditions in peoples markets and other factors management considers in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance 
further information can be found later in this discussion under allowance for loan losses 
non interest income peoples non interest income is generated from four primary sources service charges on deposit accounts  income derived from fiduciary activities  insurance and investment commissions  and electronic banking revenues 
during  peoples connections sales process  aimed at enhancing client service through integrated  relationship based selling initiatives  continued as the focal point of the consolidated marketing activity to targeted customers and prospects 
this focus has led to loan and deposit growth  as well as increases in non interest income 
non interest income from operations excluding securities and asset disposal transactions reached new levels in  totaling  an increase of  or compared to peoples service charge income on deposit accounts is based on the recovery of costs associated with services provided 
fee income generated from deposit accounts totaled  in  an increase of  or compared to  in most of the increases are attributable to increases in the volume of overdrafts and non sufficient fund fees  as well as growth in income generated from deposit services for business customers 
income from fiduciary activities  which is based primarily on the market value of assets being managed  totaled  in  down  or from s total of  at december   peoples bank s investment and trust division managed assets with a market value of approximately million down from million at year end due primarily to the us stock market correction in peoples continues to focus on strengthening its position in its core markets in order to increase the number of clients served 
management believes fiduciary revenues will continue to be significant contributors to peoples non interest income in the future 
in addition to traditional sources of non interest income  peoples also offers a complete line of insurance and investment products through peoples insurance and peoples investments 
management believes these services are integral to peoples relationship and needs based sales philosophy 
commissions on insurance and securities sales generated revenues of  in  a  or increase over the previous year 
peoples life insurance and annuity sales accounted for a majority of the revenue growth with property and casualty insurance commission revenues also increasing during the last half of as peoples insurance client service teams continue to expand the number of clients served 
peoples offers credit life and disability insurance  as well as life and property insurance to consumers in ohio and west virginia 
insurance products are underwritten by various insurance companies and are made available through licensed insurance agency affiliates of peoples 
peoples investments offers clients asset management services  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  portfolio evaluation  asset allocation  tax shelters  unit trusts  common preferred stocks  government securities  mutual funds  retirement planning  estate planning  tax exempt securities  annuities  and financial planning services 
securities are offered exclusively through raymond james financial services  member nasd sipc and an independent broker dealer  located at many of peoples sales offices 
electronic banking  which includes atm and debit card services  direct deposit services  and internet banking  is one of the many delivery channels offered by peoples to provide products and services to customers 
in  electronic banking revenues totaled  an increase of  or compared to the same period last year 
the increased revenues are due primarily to growth in the number of debit card users as well as corresponding volume increases in debit card usage 
management will continue to focus on electronic banking as a source of revenue as the financial services industry develops additional e commerce capabilities 
management believes the recent growth in non interest income reflects the success of peoples associates in professionally and quickly serving client needs 
management expects non interest income will increase modestly in due to sustained insurance and investment revenue growth 
other traditional and non traditional financial service products and delivery channels are evaluated regularly for potential inclusion in peoples product mix as management continues to explore new methods of enhancing non interest income 
gain loss on securities transactions peoples recorded net gains on securities transactions of  in compared to net losses of  the previous year 
the net gains in were the result of normal portfolio management while the net losses in were due to peoples repositioning its investment portfolio to improve pledging capabilities 
loss gain on asset disposals in  losses on asset disposals  net of disposal gains  totaled  compared to net gains of  last year 
in mid  peoples invested in a larger central processing unit  causing the increased net losses on asset disposals 
management believes the investment will enhance peoples processing capabilities  better support the integrated sales processes  and improve client service though speedier delivery of information  products  and services 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled  in  up  or compared to peoples implemented several strategic initiatives that increased current operating expenses 
in early  peoples merged its three banking subsidiaries into a single national charter  which has enhanced abilities to meet financial needs of clients 
while the internal merger caused increased expense in the near term  particularly professional fees and regulatory costs  management believes the merger will result in greater efficiencies in the long term 
when comparing s non interest expense information to s results  a portion of the increase is due to the costs associated with the trust preferred securities combination of debt service expenses and amortization of associated capitalized issuance costs and the timing of its issuance in costs relating to the trust preferred securities totaled  in  an increase of  or compared to salaries and benefits expense represents the largest component of non interest expense 
in  salaries and benefits totaled  in  up  or compared to a year ago  accounting for a majority of the overall increase in non interest expense 
the increase in wages and benefits is due to commissions paid to insurance and investment associates  wage increases necessary to retain key personnel in the competitive labor market and corresponding increases in benefits  as well as modest increases in the number of peoples customer service associates 
at december   peoples had full time equivalent employees versus at december  management will continue to leverage its resources while retaining key associates  effectively optimizing customer service and return to shareholders 
acquisitions and investments designed to enhance client service processes also affected net occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses  in particular depreciation expense 
these expenses totaled  an increase of  or compared to  in these increases can be attributed primarily to the depreciation of assets acquired through recent market expansion and construction projects at several of peoples bank s financial service centers specifically three wal mart financial service centers opened in and  as well as other banking center refurbishments  and increased depreciation of additional expenditures on technology 
peoples increased investment in technology and other customer service enhancements  designed to add convenience and speed to product delivery  will also impact depreciation expense in the future 
management believes that peoples ability to serve a core sector of its markets in a cost effective manner is tied to its technology based delivery channels 
maintaining acceptable levels of non interest expense and operating efficiency are key performance indicators for peoples in its strategic initiatives 
the financial services industry uses the efficiency ratio total non interest expense less amortization of intangibles and non recurring items as a percentage of the aggregate of fully tax equivalent net interest income and non interest income as an important indicator of performance 
gains and losses on sales of investment securities  as well as other nonrecurring charges  are not included in the calculation of peoples efficiency ratio 
management also compares non interest income as a percentage of operational non interest expense  which totaled in compared to in in  peoples efficiency ratio was compared to s ratio of 
the combination of compressed net interest margins and increased levels of non interest expense have negatively affected peoples efficiency ratio 
management believes current investments in and expansion of client service efforts helps peoples accomplish its goal of improving convenience  flexibility  and speed for clients 
in  management will focus on reducing non interest expense growth rates without sacrificing client service levels or slowing peoples expansion into non traditional products and services 
return on equity after removing the impact of intangibles and corresponding amortization  return on tangible equity increased to in compared to in peoples return on average stockholders equity roe was in compared to a year earlier 
using a portion of the proceeds from the trust preferred securities issuance  peoples implemented stock repurchase programs that have favorably impacted roe through the reduction in the number of outstanding common shares and the corresponding reduction in equity 
similar capital management enhancements to roe will depend on the timing of common share repurchases and the availability of peoples common shares through the recently announced stock repurchase program 
peoples and its banking subsidiaries are considered well capitalized under regulatory and industry standards of risk based capital as discussed in note of the notes to peoples consolidated financial statements and such ratios grew stronger in return on assets after removing the impact of intangibles and corresponding amortization  return on tangible assets was in versus in return on average assets roa was in compared to a year ago 
the leverage strategy implemented in significantly increased the peoples asset base and caused a reduction in peoples tangible return on assets and roa 
additional net interest income from the leverage strategy was offset primarily by the trust preferred securities costs  resulting in lower roa levels than previous periods 
management anticipates that roa will remain relatively unchanged through the first part of peoples will be challenged to employ its asset base in a manner that will produce higher returns on assets 
management intends to continue peoples strategic focus on ratios such as return on tangible equity  return on equity  cash earnings per share  and earnings per share 
income tax expense peoples has implemented tax reduction strategies  including investments in low income housing and historic tax credits  to reduce tax burden and lower effective tax rate 
in  peoples effective tax rate was versus in reflecting the success of these strategies 
at december   peoples cumulative investment in these types of projects approximated million 
peoples plans to make additional investments in various tax credit pools over the next several years with the total investment not expected to exceed million 
these investments are expected to benefit peoples future results of operations by reducing peoples effective tax rate 
management anticipates a similar effective tax rate in due to these investments and continues to explore other ways to reduce peoples tax burden 
overview of the balance sheet total assets were billion at december   an increase of million or compared to year end loan volume increased million or to million  with most of the growth occurring in real estate and commercial loans 
total liabilities increased million or since year end to billion at december  due to growth of peoples interest bearing deposits  particularly money market accounts  peoples total deposits increased million or to million in peoples total short term borrowings increased million or to million at december  the april issuance of the trust preferred securities is presented as guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in junior subordinated debentures 
peoples has classified the trust preferred securities as mezzanine equity on its balance sheet  net of issuance costs of approximately million  which are amortized over the term of the security indebtedness 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   an increase of million or since december  at december   peoples had million of net unrealized losses on available for sale securities compared to million of unrealized losses on available for sale securities at december  peoples had a treasury share balance of million at year end  compared to million at december  in the first quarter of  peoples reissued treasury shares in connection with a stock dividend to shareholders 
peoples expects to purchase treasury shares through the stock repurchase plan  as appropriate and the stock benefit plans repurchase program as well as the deferred compensation plan that permits peoples directors to acquire common shares through deferral of director fees 
cash and cash equivalents peoples cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   a decrease of million compared to at year end  peoples retained additional cash reserves for potential customer withdrawals related to the yk date change 
since peoples did not experience any significant withdrawals  management redeployed the excess cash into earning assets in january normally  management directs liquid funds into higher yielding assets such as loans to meet loan demand in its markets and enhance profitability 
management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents  readily available access to traditional and non traditional funding sources  and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year adequately serve peoples liquidity and performance needs 
while total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate on a daily basis due to transactions in process and other liquidity needs  these other sources of funds should enable peoples to meet cash obligations and off balance sheet commitments as they occur 
investment securities investment securities totaled million at year end  up million or compared to december   as a result of modest increases in the market value of the investment portfolio 
all of peoples investment securities are classified as available for sale 
management believes the available for sale classification provides flexibility for peoples in terms of selling securities as well as interest rate risk management opportunities 
at december   the amortized cost of peoples investment securities totaled million  resulting in unrealized depreciation in the investment portfolio of million and a corresponding decrease in equity of million 
investments in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies and corporations increased million to million at december  in  investments in mortgage backed securities decreased million to million and represented the largest segment of peoples investment securities portfolio 
peoples balances in investment obligations of states and political subdivisions totaled million at december   an increase of million since year end corporate and other investments at december   totaled million  a decrease of million since year end management may reduce investment securities in future periods as a mechanism to fund higher yielding assets such as loans 
management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through asset liability committee alco meetings 
the group also monitors net interest income  sets pricing guidelines  and manages interest rate risk for the company 
through active balance sheet management and analysis of the investment securities portfolio  the company maintains sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor requirements and the various credit needs of its customers 
management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable based on these parameters 
loans peoples lending is primarily focused in central and southeastern ohio  northern west virginia  and northeastern kentucky markets  and consists principally of retail lending  which includes single family residential mortgages and other consumer loans 
gross loans totaled million at december   an increase of million or since year end retail loan growth occurred primarily in peoples existing markets  while some commercial lending growth came from selected customers outside peoples primary geographic markets 
peoples experienced significant loan growth during in commercial  financial  and agricultural loans commercial loans  which increased million or to million 
at december   commercial loans comprised of peoples total loan portfolio and represented the largest portion of the loan portfolio 
economic conditions in peoples markets have provided quality credit opportunities  in particular  in southeastern and central ohio 
management will continue to focus on the enhancement and growth of the commercial loan portfolio while maintaining appropriate underwriting standards and risk price balance 
management expects commercial loan demand to moderate somewhat in in addition to the anticipated additional in market penetration  peoples will continue to selectively lend to customers outside its primary markets 
real estate loans to peoples retail customers including real estate construction loans account for the second largest portion of the loan portfolio  comprising of peoples total loan portfolio 
real estate mortgage loans totaled million at december   up million or since year end included in real estate loans are home equity credit lines equilines  which totaled million at december   compared to million at december  during  peoples offered a specially priced equiline product to qualifying customers  which contributed to the equiline balance increase 
management believes the equiline loans are a competitive product with an acceptable return on investment after risk considerations 
residential real estate lending continues to represent a major focus of peoples lending due to the lower risk factors associated with this type of loan and the opportunity to provide additional products and services to these consumers at reasonable yields to peoples 
consumer lending continues to be a vital part of peoples core lending 
in  consumer loan balances excluding credit card loans increased million or to million 
the majority of peoples consumer loans are in the indirect lending area  which had loan balances of million at december   compared to million at december  peoples credit card balances at december   totaled million  up million or since year end while management continues to explore new opportunities to serve credit card customers  those plans do not include the assumption of additional unnecessary risk merely for the sake of growth 
management is pleased with the performance and quality of peoples consumer loan portfolio  which can be attributed to peoples commitment to a high level of customer service and the continued demand for indirect loans in the markets served by peoples 
lenders use a tiered pricing system that enables peoples to apply interest rates based on the corresponding risk associated with the indirect loan 
although consumer debt delinquency has increased in the financial services industry due mostly to credit card debt  management s actions to reinforce peoples pricing system and underwriting criteria have tempered indirect lending delinquencies 
management plans to continue its focus on the use of this tiered pricing system in the future  combined with controlled growth of the indirect lending portfolio if economic conditions remain strong 
loan concentration peoples largest concentration of commercial loans is in credits to assisted living facilities nursing homes  which comprised approximately of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   compared to at year end these lending opportunities have arisen due to recent industry growth in certain markets or contiguous areas 
management believes peoples loans to assisted living facilities nursing homes do not present more than the normal amount of risk assumed in other types of lending 
while loans to assisted living facilities nursing homes comprise the largest portion  loans to lodging and lodging related companies also represent a significant portion of peoples commercial loans 
at december   lodging and lodging related loans accounted for of peoples outstanding commercial loans  compared to at year end allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio analysis on pages and of this form k presents in detail an analysis of peoples loan portfolio  the allowance for loan losses  loan chargeoffs and recoveries by type of loan  and an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan type 
management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its loan review department and loan loss committee to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this formal analysis determines the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  allocation of the allowance among loan types and the adequacy of the unallocated component of the allowance 
the portion of the allowance allocated among the various loan types represents management s estimate of expected losses based upon specific allocations for individual lending relationships  historical loss experience for each category of loans  and other economic factors 
the individual loan reviews are based upon specific qualitative and quantitative criteria  including the size of the loan and loan grades below a predetermined level 
the historical experience factor is based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets and industries  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
allowances for homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans  credit cards  personal loans  etc 
are collectively evaluated upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based upon management s assessment of qualitative risk factors that may not be evident in peoples historical experience  such as  but not limited to  changes in specific markets in both competition for loans and local economies 
this assessment involves a high degree of management judgment as well as higher amounts of uncertainty 
assessment of the adequacy of the allowance is a dynamic process that requires management to continually refine the process as markets  economic conditions  and the company change 
differences between actual loss experiences and estimated events are compared on a quarterly basis  allowing management to regularly modify loss provisions as deemed appropriate based on market conditions and other factors previously described 
the results of this analysis at december   indicated an increase in the amount allocated to the commercial category resulting from recent increases in peoples commercial loans outstanding and recent loss trends 
the amount allocated to the remaining categories and the unallocated portion reflect the growth in the portfolios and changes in economic conditions 
management expects continued loan growth in and believes that the provision for losses will increase in the first quarter of compared to the recent quarterly expense of peoples consumer loan net chargeoffs continue to comprise the largest portion of total net chargeoffs  reaching  in and accounting for of total net chargeoffs 
in comparison to  consumer loan net chargeoffs increased  or due to increased indirect loan chargeoffs 
commercial loan net chargeoffs totaled  in  an increase of  over although commercial loan net chargeoffs in grew significantly higher in comparison to  management believes s results are more reflective of peoples historical commercial loan chargeoff experience 
credit card net chargeoffs decreased  in comparison to to  in real estate loan net chargeoffs were insignificant in  demonstrating the quality of the portfolio 
management evaluates peoples loan portfolio quality by monitoring the amount of nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans 
nonperforming loans include loans days or more past due  renegotiated loans  and loans classified as nonaccrual 
at december   nonperforming loans totaled  compared to  in or and of total outstanding loans  respectively 
the increase in nonperforming loans is due primarily to approximately million of commercial loans from several different industries being placed on nonaccrual status in late management considered these loans in establishing the allowance for loan losses at december  peoples has taken aggressive steps to deal with the nonperforming loans 
despite the increase  management believes the current level of nonperforming loans is below peer group levels and is a reflection of the overall quality of peoples loan portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that peoples will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of potential impaired loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s historical effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  impairment loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired under statement of financial standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 was million of which million was accruing interest  and million was nonaccrual loans 
included in this amount is million of impaired loans for which the related allowance for loan losses is million 
the remaining impaired loan balances of million do not have a related allocation of the allowance for loan losses as a result of write downs  being well secured  or possessing characteristics demonstrating ability to repay the loan 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans in was approximately million 
in  peoples recognized interest income on impaired loans of  or of peoples total interest income in the same period 
funding sources peoples considers a number of alternatives  including but not limited to deposits  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings when evaluating funding sources 
traditional deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for peoples  totaling million  or of peoples funding sources at december  non interest bearing deposits are core funding sources for peoples 
at december   non interest bearing balances totaled million  a million or increase compared to year end management intends to continue to focus on maintaining its base of lower costing funding sources through product offerings that benefit customers who enhance their relationship with peoples by using multiple products and services 
interest bearing deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million or compared to year end interest bearing transaction accounts were the largest growth component of peoples deposits  increasing million or to million at december   due primarily to growth in peoples money market account balances 
peoples money market accounts offer variable  competitive rates that allow clients some flexibility of transactions and the opportunity to earn higher investment yields 
in addition to growth of balances in money market accounts  peoples offered a month cd special throughout this product provided an attractive rate of return for customers  increased peoples competitive position to retain and grow deposits and helped fund loan growth 
in early  peoples replaced the month cd special with a month cd special 
management will continue to emphasize deposit gathering in the future by offering special relationship accounts both non interest bearing and interest bearing based on other products and services offered while balancing deposit growth with adequate net interest margin to meet peoples strategic goals 
while traditional deposits serve as core funding sources  peoples also accesses both short term and long term borrowings to fund its operations and investments 
peoples short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  commercial deposits held in overnight repurchase agreements  wholesale funds such as term repurchase agreements  and various fhlb borrowings 
at december   short term borrowings totaled million  an increase of million or over year end the largest component of peoples short term borrowing at december   was fhlb advances of million  an increase of million or  of which million of the increase can be attributed to repayments of certain long term  callable fhlb advances using short term  repo based fhlb advances 
growth in borrowings  such as fhlb advances  was due primarily to fund loan growth 
in addition to short term fhlb advances  peoples had total short term  national market repurchase agreement balances of million at december   a decrease of million or compared to year end peoples also had million of commercial overnight repurchase agreement balances with its customers at december   down million or from a year ago 
short term fhlb advances and national market repurchase agreements were accessed heavily at the end of to fund peoples yk cash reserves for potentially large customer deposit withdrawals 
those borrowings were repaid in early january  however  peoples continued to access these funding sources at various times during the year to balance liquidity needs and fund loan growth 
peoples also maintains long term borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
long term fhlb advances decreased million or since year end  totaling million at december  peoples long term fhlb advances are primarily year borrowings  with fixed rate features for periods of two  three  or four years  depending on the specific advance 
each advance  at the discretion of the fhlb  may reprice after its initial fixed rate period  and peoples has the option to repay any repriced advance without penalty  or allow the borrowing to reprice to a libor based  variable product 
in june  management opted to repay long term fhlb advances that would have repriced to current market rates of interest to take advantage of potential cost savings using other available short term advances 
management plans to maintain access to long term fhlb borrowings as an appropriate funding source 
peoples also has a variable rate  long term note with an unaffiliated financial institution 
the original principal balance of the note was million and was used to finance an acquisition in early principal payments began in and continue semiannually over the next three years 
at december   the balance was million  a decrease of million since year end capital stockholders equity during the year ended december   stockholders equity increased approximately million or to million 
in  peoples had net income of million and paid dividends of million  a dividend payout ratio of of earnings  compared to a ratio of in management believes recent dividends represent an acceptable payout ratio for peoples and anticipates similar payout ratios in future periods through quarterly dividends 
at december   the adjustment for the net unrealized holding loss on available for sale securities  net of deferred income taxes  totaled million  a change of million since year end since all the investment securities in peoples portfolio are classified as available for sale  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments 
the changes in market value of peoples investment portfolio directly impacted peoples stockholders equity 
management believes peoples capital continues to provide a strong base for profitable growth 
banking regulators have established risk based capital requirements designed to measure capital adequacy and the relative risks of various assets banks hold in their portfolios through risk based capital ratios 
as part of these requirements  each asset is assigned a risk weight category of lowest risk assets    or highest risk assets 
peoples and peoples bank have complied with these requirements 
detailed information concerning peoples risk based capital ratios can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   peoples and peoples bank s risk based capital ratios were above the minimum standards for a well capitalized institution 
peoples risk based capital ratio of at december   is well above the well capitalized standard of 
peoples tier capital ratio of also exceeded the well capitalized minimum of 
the leverage ratio at year end was and was also above the well capitalized standard of 
since april  peoples has repurchased common shares through the and stock repurchase programs 
during  peoples purchased  shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions at a weighted average price of per share 
peoples is authorized to purchase up to  shares or of outstanding shares in as part of the stock repurchased program 
the timing of the purchases and the actual number of common shares purchased have depended and will continue to depend on market conditions 
in june  peoples implemented a formal plan to purchase treasury shares for use in its stock option plans 
the formal plan serves as the basis for treasury purchases in anticipation of peoples projected stock option exercises and is based upon specific criteria related to market prices  as well as the number of common shares expected to be reissued under peoples stock option plans 
under the plan  peoples is currently authorized to repurchase  common shares each quarter 
during  peoples purchased  treasury shares at a weighted average price of per share  totaling million 
management expects to purchase similar share amounts in future quarters for use in its stock option plans 
future changes  if any  to peoples systematic share repurchase program may be necessary to respond to the number of common shares expected to be reissued for peoples stock option plans 
management intends to continue its systematic quarterly treasury share program 
peoples also maintains the peoples bancorp inc deferred compensation plan deferred compensation plan for the directors of peoples and its subsidiaries 
the deferred compensation plan is designed to recognize the value to peoples of the past and present service of its directors and encourage their continued service through implementation of a deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows directors to direct the fees earned for their services into deferred accounts that are invested either in peoples common shares or in time deposits  at the specific director s discretion at the time of entering the plan 
as a result and in accordance with accounting regulations  the account balances invested in peoples common shares are reported as treasury stock in peoples financial statements 
at december   the deferred compensation plan and its participants were entitled to million of peoples common shares  which is a reduction to the equity balance of peoples 
management does not expect the deferred compensation plan to have a material impact on future financial statements or results of operations of peoples 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the objective of peoples asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within peoples policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through management of peoples balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposure based on changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels  and customer preferences 
interest rate risk the most significant risk resulting from peoples normal business of extending loans and accepting deposits  is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk irr is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes which can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples management has charged the alco with the overall management of peoples and its subsidiary bank s balance sheet and off balance sheet transactions related to the management of irr 
the alco strives to keep peoples focused on the future  anticipating and exploring alternatives  rather than simply reacting to change after the fact 
to this end  the alco has established an interest rate risk management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and controlling the level and amount of interest rate risk 
the objective of the interest rate risk policy is to encourage management to adhere to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovations necessary to meet the challenges of changing markets 
the ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity  and safety 
peoples alco relies on different methods of assessing interest rate risk including simulating net interest income  monitoring the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity  and monitoring the difference or gap between maturing or rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
the alco places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of interest rate risk because it is a dynamic measure 
by employing a simulation process that measures the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures and by establishing limits on changes in net income and net market value  the alco is better able to evaluate the possible risks associated with alternative strategies 
the simulation process starts with a base case simulation that represents projections of current balance sheet growth trends 
base case simulation results are prepared under an assumed flat interest rate scenario and at least two alternative interest rate scenarios  one rising and one declining  assuming parallel yield curve shifts 
comparisons showing the earnings variance from the flat rate forecast illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet strategy 
when necessary  additional balance sheet strategies are developed and simulations prepared 
these additional simulations are run with the same interest rate scenarios used with the base case simulation and or using different yield curves 
the additional strategies are used to measure yield curve risk  prepayment risk  basis risk  and index lag risk inherent in the balance sheet 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case provide the alco with information concerning the risks associated with implementing the alternative strategies 
the results from model simulations are reviewed for indications of whether current interest rate risk strategies are accomplishing their goal and  if not  the alco evaluates alternative strategies 
the alco periodically reviews the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the modeling and the overall techniques employed 
peoples monitors interest rate risk for both the short and long term 
therefore  to effectively evaluate results from model simulations  limits on changes in net interest income and the value of the balance sheet have been established 
to monitor the short term exposure to interest rate risk  the alco limited the earnings at risk of the bank to or less from base case for each shift in interest rates 
to monitor the long term exposure to interest rate risk  management has limited the negative impact on net equity value to or less when interest rates shift and when rates shift  respectively 
for an assessment of the current interest rate risk position  the alco reviews static gap measures for specific time periods focusing on one year cumulative gap 
based on historical trends and performance  the alco has determined that the ratio of the one year cumulative gap should be within of earning assets 
the following table is provided to show the estimated earnings at risk and value at risk positions of peoples at december  dollars in thousands immediate interest rate estimated estimated increase decrease in decrease increase decrease increase in basis points in net interest income economic value of equity the interest risk analysis shows that peoples is moderately liability sensitive 
this means that downward moving interest rates should favorably impact net interest income and upward moving interest rates should negatively impact net interest income 
the analysis also shows that for all simulations and all scenarios  peoples is within the interest rate risk limits that the alco has established in the policy 
peoples was within the policy limits at all measured points during the preceding year 
the liability sensitivity increased in the past twelve months due to the loan growth peoples experienced in to protect earnings streams should there be an increase in interest rates or hedge the liability sensitivity  the alco authorized the purchase of interest rate options  termed caps  that will provide additional income if there is a significant increase in interest rates 
liquidity maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity is a primary objective of the alco 
liquidity  as defined by the alco  is the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand  and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
the alco s policy for liquidity management sets limits on the net liquidity position of peoples and the concentration of non core funding sources 
the main source of liquidity for peoples is deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided from cash generated from assets such as maturities  principal payments and income from loans and investment securities 
in  cash provided by financing activities totaled million due to the growth of short term borrowings and interest bearing deposit growth  while outflows from investing activity totaled million 
the majority of the increase in cash outflows from investing activities occurred as a result of the growth in peoples loan portfolio 
peoples  when appropriate  takes advantage of external sources of funds such as advances from the federal home loan bank  national market repurchase agreements  and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that enable peoples to match funding dates with contractual maturity dates of assets 
securities in the investment portfolio that are available for sale can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity 
the net liquidity position of peoples is calculated by subtracting volatile liabilities  non core deposits and brokered funds  from liquid assets  short term investments and unpledged available for sale securities 
as of december   the net liquidity position of peoples was million or of total assets 
as of december   the net liquidity position of peoples was million or of total assets 
the decrease in is the result of maturities in available for sale securities  which were used to fund loan growth 
the liquidity position as of year end was within peoples policy limit of negative of total assets 
the alco believes peoples has sufficient liquidity to meet current obligations to borrowers  depositors  debt holders  and others 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of the company s assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
therefore  they are not impacted by inflation to the same degree as companies in capital intensive industries in a replacement cost environment 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
in the banking industry  typically monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities 
therefore  as prices have recently increased  financial institutions experienced a decline in the purchasing power of their net assets 
future outlook despite recent challenges facing the financial services industry  peoples attained several key financial goals in including double digit growth in earnings per share  enhanced return on shareholders equity  growth in loan balances  increased non interest revenues  and continued expansion of peoples integrated  needs based sales process using its connections theme to successfully grow client relationships 
part of the reason for peoples financial success in was the execution of the stock repurchase programs  which helped to enhance return on shareholders equity and earnings per share 
peoples ability to achieve similar success in will be influenced by potential stock purchases under the stock repurchase program  as well as numerous factors that affect the financial services industry such as interest rate changes 
peoples experienced growth in net interest income in even though rising interest rates  which negatively impacted peoples interest bearing liabilities  were a continuing challenge 
management continues to refine and update its asset liability simulation modeling process  most recently in response to interest rate reductions by the federal reserve in early despite these reductions  net interest income and margins will be challenged in early as pricing pressure from other competitors further compresses margins  a challenge facing the entire financial services industry 
management has already taken steps to reduce longer term interest rate exposure by lowering cd and ira rates and terms from a month special offered throughout to a month special 
while this change should result in improved net interest income  any improvement will be at least partially offset by decreases in prime based commercial loans resulting from the federal reserve s recent basis point decrease in rates 
in early  peoples merged its three banking subsidiaries into a single national charter and incurred additional expenses  such as professional fees and regulatory costs  for first year integration costs 
the consolidation gives peoples clients access to all sales offices  atms  and internet banking in addition to connecting the northeastern kentucky markets with contiguous ohio and west virginia markets 
while the merger has already produced many positive results in  including enhanced ability to meet all the financial needs of peoples clients and reduced regulatory burden  peoples focus in will be further product integration and market penetration 
the start of has already been marked by expansion with the opening of peoples emerson avenue financial services center  peoples fourth banking center in wood county  west virginia 
the office includes some unique features compared to peoples other sales offices such as a home resource center  an investment resource center and an internet cafe 
since opening on january in parkersburg  the emerson avenue financial services center has been featured in americanbanker 
com  local and regional newspapares  and other media outlets  for its creative layout and inviting customer service areas 
management believes the emerson avenue financial services center is a model that can be duplicated in some of peoples existing sales office 
in addition to the opening of the emerson avenue financial services center  peoples bank opened its th sales office with the completion of the merger acquisition of lower salem commercial bank of lower salem  ohio  on february   lower salem represents an opportunity for peoples to expand its presence in northern washington county 
management s focus now shifts to the integration of non traditional products  such as investments and insurance  with the traditional products lower salem currently offers 
peoples personal relationships and electronic access connect clients with peoples in ways not available a decade ago 
e commerce has generated much hype in recent years  however  peoples has approached the e world with the same progressively conservative attitude that has proven successful in its banking model 
while technology such as the internet  peoples online connection and peoples telebank continue to be areas of focus  peoples does not plan to supplant the personal contact that peoples traditional banking centers currently offer 
management believes such technology provides peoples with new ways of enhancing product and service delivery and strengthening client relationships 
in  peoples will continue to focus on increasing its fee based business since the margin based business is dependent on the unpredictable interest rate environment 
one of peoples main goals is the complete integration of its traditional products with newer  non traditional products  such as investments and insurance 
through this integration and continued focus  peoples clients will have access to a world of financial products through their preferred delivery channel 
management anticipates that a significant portion of future earnings growth will be derived from the expanded fee base business 
mergers and acquisitions remain a viable strategic option for continuing growth of operations and scope of client service as well as a viable method of enhancing peoples earnings potential 
management will continue to pursue appropriate business opportunities that complement existing company locations and revenue growth strategies through a variety of means including mergers and acquisitions 
future acquisitions  if they occur  may not be limited to specific geographic location or proximity to current market  but ultimately will depend upon opportunities that complement peoples core competencies and strategic intent 
management believes peoples is positioned for continued revenue growth in and beyond 
although competition for loans and deposits  as well as short term borrowing costs  continue to impact peoples short term profitability due to challenges to net interest income levels  management will continue to analyze and implement strategies designed to enhance the long term value of peoples 
peoples many sales associates are firmly committed to client service and long term stakeholder success 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this form k which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the interest rate environment  the effect of federal and state banking and tax regulations  the effect of technological changes  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  and other risks detailed in peoples securities and exchange commission filings 
although management believe that the expectations in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of management s knowledge of peoples business and operations  it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these projections

net interest margin decreased in to from in yield on earning assets totaled in  compared to the prior year 
a significant contributor to this decline was the decrease in peoples loan portfolio yield  which dropped basis points to in as a result of increased demand for loans in the markets peoples serves 
compared to  cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in deposit costs decreased due to a combination of lowering time deposit rates and the acquisition of lower interest cost funding sources from the west virginia banking center acquisition 
peoples provision for loan losses totaled  in  down  compared to  a decrease of 
overall improvement in the loan portfolio s quality and associated credit risk combined with an adequate allowance for loan losses provided the basis to reduce the provision for loan losses during at december   peoples allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was  compared to a year end ratio of non interest income from operations excluding securities transactions totaled  in  an increase of compared to in  deposit account service charge income increased  or to  a primary cause for this increase was a full year s impact of the west virginia banking center acquisition and its associated million in deposits  which provided the base for increased fee income 
income from fiduciary activities totaled  an increase of compared to electronic banking income totaled  in  up  or over the prior year 
electronic banking income increased primarily due to growth in the number of debit card users and the associated volume increases in debit card usage

compared to  salaries and benefits expense increased  or to  in furniture and equipment expenses totaled  in  up  or  and net occupancy expense totaled  in  an increase of  or compared to the previous year 
these increases can be attributed primarily to the depreciation of the assets purchased in business acquisitions in particular the west virginia banking center acquisition  and the completion of various branch banking office construction projects during non operational items also contributed to the increase in non interest expense 
in particular  amortization of intangibles totaled  up  or compared to  with most of the increase due to the west virginia banking center acquisition in total assets reached billion at december   up million compared to year end asset growth can be attributed primarily to the leverage strategy implemented during the second quarter of with the largest growth occurring in the investment securities portfolio  which increased million or from year end to million at december  loans continued to be the largest earning asset component for peoples totaling million at year end  an increase of million or compared to year end due to continued loan demand in peoples established markets
