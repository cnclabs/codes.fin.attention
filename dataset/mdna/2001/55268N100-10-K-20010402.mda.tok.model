overview mdsi develops  markets  implements and supports mobile workforce management and wireless connectivity software for use by a wide variety of companies that have substantial mobile workforces  such as utilities  telecommunications companies  cable companies and insurance companies 
mdsi s products are used by such companies in conjunction with public and private wireless data communications networks to provide comprehensive solutions for the automation of business processes associated with the scheduling  dispatching and management of a mobile workforce 
the company s products are designed to provide a cost effective method for companies with mobile workers to utilize data communications to communicate with such workers  and for such workers to interface on a real time basis with their corporate information systems 
mdsi also provides hosting and related professional services 
the company s revenue is derived from i software and services  consisting of the licensing of software and provision of related services  including project management  installation  integration  customization and training  ii e business services such as the provision of consulting and hosting services  the provision of application services  and provision of online service management solutions  iii third party products and services  consisting of the provision of non mdsi products and services as part of the total contract and iv maintenance and support  consisting of the provision of after sale support services as well as hourly  annual or extended maintenance contracts 
the company believes that recent economic developments and trends have adversely affected and may continue to affect levels of capital spending by companies in a variety of industries  including companies in the vertical markets that the company serves 
in addition  current economic conditions and developments in the energy markets may have an adverse affect on the financial condition of energy and utility companies in certain geographic areas of north america 
the company anticipates that such economic conditions and regulatory trends may affect demand in for the products and services offered by the company 
a decline in demand for mdsi s products in these markets as a result of economic conditions  or otherwise  may have a material adverse effect on mdsi s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
in order to address the potential uncertainties caused by these economic trends  mdsi has taken measures to reduce its operating expenses through workforce reductions and other measures 
in connection with this restructuring  on march   mdsi terminated employee and contractor positions in canada and the united states and will record a one time charge of approximately million in the first quarter of see forward looking statements 
field service business the implementation of a complete mobile data solution requires a wireless data communications network  a land based data communications network  mobile computing devices integrated with wireless data communication modems  host computer equipment  industry specific application software such as mdsi s advantex products  wireless connectivity software and a variety of services to manage and install these components  integrate them with an organization s existing computer systems and configure or customize the software to meet customer requirements 
frequently  in the company s larger contracts only a limited number of the mobile computing devices and in vehicle equipment are installed initially  with the balance implemented over a rollout period that may extend up to one year or more 
where increases in mobile work forces require  or where additional departments of mobile workers are added  additional mobile computing devices may be installed 
revenue for software and services has historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenue 
typically  the company enters into a fixed price contract with a customer for the licensing of selected software products and the provision of specific services that are generally performed within six to twelve months 
pricing for these contracts includes license fees as well as a fee for professional services 
the company generally recognizes total revenue for software and services associated with a contract using a percentage of completion method based on the total costs incurred over the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
the company s customers typically enter into ongoing maintenance agreements that provide for maintenance and technical support services for a period commencing after expiration of the initial warranty period 
maintenance agreements typically have a term of twelve months and are invoiced either annually or monthly 
revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the company is periodically called on to provide  in addition to mdsi products and services  certain third party products  such as host computer hardware and operating system software  and mobile computing 
the company recognizes revenue of the supply on third party hardware upon transfer of title to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue on the supply on third party services using a percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred over the total estimated cost to complete the third party services contract 
the company believes that it will often supply some portion of third party products and services to customers where it is successful in selling its own products and services 
there can be no assurance  however  that any contracts entered into by the company to supply third party software and products in the future will represent a substantial portion of revenue in any future period 
since the revenue generated from the supply of third party products and services may represent a significant portion of certain contracts and the installation and rollout of third party products is generally at the discretion of the customer  the company may  depending on the level of third party products and services provided during a period  experience large quarterly fluctuations in revenue 
the company s revenue is dependent  in large part  on significant contracts from a limited number of customers 
as a result  any substantial delay in the company s completion of a contract  the inability of the company to obtain new contracts or the cancellation of an existing contract by a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
some of the company s contracts are cancelable upon notice by the customer 
the loss of certain contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from period to period 
during the second quarter of  the company announced version r of its advantex product  and it is currently in the implementation phase of its first contracts using version r the increased time required for the initial implementation and field testing of a new version of software has resulted in delays in commencement of additional installations of the advantex r product 
such delays have increased the company s costs of completing advantex r installations and have affected the timing of the company s recognition of revenue from such contracts 
the company completed its first r installation in the first quarter of  and anticipates that it will complete its second installation of the advantex r product in the second quarter of e business the company launched its e business division in february to develop internet based business solutions for companies of varying sizes  in the general services market 
like the company s other advantex mobile workforce management applications  the company s e business solutions will allow companies to empower mobile workers by providing a reliable wireless link to enterprise or internet applications 
customers of service providers that use the company s e business solutions will be able to purchase  schedule  confirm and track service appointments online without human intervention  providing convenience and flexibility hours a day  days a week 
the company intends to offer its e business solutions through four channels sites that aggregate service providers  wireless carriers  major vertical focused asps application service providers  and directly to service providers 
on june   the company acquired connectria corporation  based in st 
louis  missouri  which currently provides consulting and internet hosting services for third party applications 
the company has announced several alliances that are expected to further its e business strategy 
the company launched its scheduling and dispatch application  eservicemanager formerly serveclick  on an asp basis to service providers in the fourth quarter of the company s e business model is expected to allow companies to use mdsi products and services on a subscription or transaction fee basis  rather than license and host these mdsi products themselves 
the company believes that its e business solutions subscription and transaction fee programs is an attractive solution for small or medium sized companies that can benefit from mdsi s workforce management and scheduling applications  without the financial or information technology investment required to license and implement mdsi s on site solutions 
currently  the company s e business revenue is derived from providing managed services  which include managed application services  managed network services  managed data center services  and managed hosting services 
the company also earns revenues by providing ebusiness consulting services 
the future success of the company s e business development strategy will depend on the company s ability to develop and implement the technology related to its e business solutions  the company s ability to enter into contracts with service providers  service portals and asp s  and the adoption of the company s e business solutions by service providers and their customers 
growth in the company s e business revenue is anticipated to be derived primarily from transaction fees generated by customer and service provider use of the e business scheduling solutions 
the company has not generated material revenues from fees associated with its e business scheduling solutions and there can be no assurance that the company s e business division will generate material revenues from these solutions in future periods 
effects of acquisitions on june   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of connectria  an asp and provider of online service management solutions for service companies 
the company issued  common shares and assumed  employee stock options in exchange for all of the outstanding stock and options of connectria
