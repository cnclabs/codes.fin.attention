item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant events all six of the company s vlccs operating in the spot market are trading in the tankers international ti pool 
ti  which commenced operations in february  was established by the company and five other leading tanker companies to meet the global transportation requirements of international oil companies and other major charterers 
the ti pool of modern vlccs has been able to improve vessel utilization through backhauls  contracts of affreightment and other efficiencies facilitated by the size and quality of its modern vlcc fleet 
in addition to the six osg vlccs currently trading in the spot market through the ti pool  osg has four vlcc newbuildings scheduled for delivery within the next two years  all of which will be operated in the ti pool 
in the first quarter of  the company s two foreign flag dry bulk carriers joined a pool consisting of modern capesize dry bulk carriers 
operations income from vessel operations revenues and results of vessel operations of the company are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the types and sizes owned and operated by the company and the markets in which those vessels operate 
freight rates  expressed as time charter equivalents tce defined as voyage revenues less voyage expenses divided by round trip voyage days  for major bulk commodities are determined by market forces such as local and worldwide demand for the commodities carried  volumes of trade  distances that the commodities must be transported  and the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over periods of projected requirements 
available tonnage is affected  over time  by the volume of newbuilding deliveries and removal of existing tonnage from service 
revenues for particular periods are also affected by such factors as the mix between voyage and time charters  the prevailing rates at the time when charters that are currently being performed were negotiated  the levels of applicable rates and the business available as particular vessels come off existing charters  and the timing of drydocking of vessels 
during  opec increased oil production by nearly four million barrels per day in response to rising world oil demand  low oil stock levels and the need of major oil consuming nations to replenish depleted oil stocks 
the resulting increases in demand for vlccs were reflected in a substantial improvement in vlcc rates 
time charter equivalent rates for modern vlccs in for routes on which the company s vessels typically trade averaged  per day  above the average result 
rates showed substantial gains in each of the four quarters 
beginning the year at  per day  rates on the middle east west route rose to average close to  per day in the first quarter   per day in the second quarter   per day in the third quarter and  per day in the fourth quarter 
rates reached a peak on this route of  per day in the first week in december  then trended lower as iraq substantially reduced crude exports and opec gave notice that it was contemplating an oil production cut in early following four increases in rates slipped to  per day as of late january  still well above the average annual tce rates that prevailed during the last years 
the middle east west route  by combining voyages from the middle east to western destinations with voyages from west africa to far eastern destinations  provides opportunities for triangulation that substantially improve tce returns 
china and india  in particular  recorded large increases in their crude oil imports 
as a member of ti  osg benefited substantially from china s sizable increase in crude oil purchases from such long haul origins as the middle east and west africa 
the vlcc market predominantly entails longer haul voyages 
accordingly  in a rising rate environment  such as that which prevailed in  there is typically a lag before an increase in rates is fully reflected in actual vessel results 
rates for aframax tankers in the caribbean climbed dramatically throughout the year to average  per day  higher than that achieved in while average aframax tce rates moved successively higher in each quarter  they were more volatile than vlcc rates 
aframax tce rates began the year in a sharp decline to almost  per day  followed by a strong rise through the end of march to  per day  reflecting heavy spot liftings of north sea output 
as seasonal refinery maintenance in europe took effect in april and competing supplies from the middle east increased  rates declined to  per day 
rates then rose to  per day by late july as large tanker utilization rates approached historically high levels and aframaxes were increasingly employed to lighter vlccs in the us gulf 
an easing in tanker supply tightness by mid august and renewed north sea maintenance pushed rates down to  per day by early september 
a strong recovery ensued  however  fueled by an active lightering program in the us gulf coinciding with rising production in key aframax load regions  lifting rates to approximately  per day by late october 
changes in mexican crude production contributed to volatility in rates in the fourth quarter of rates dropped in late december in anticipation of seasonal refinery turnarounds in the us gulf and opec output reductions in and as of late january  rates dropped to  per day 
the company s aframax tanker pool with pdv marina continues to complement its base of venezuelan cargoes with backhauls and contracts of affreightment  resulting in increased operating efficiencies and reduced idle time for osg s pool vessels 
in  tces for products carriers in the caribbean averaged  per day compared with  per day in tce rates began to rise into the second quarter  from a low of  per day in mid january to  per day in april 
this strengthening in rates was due to a lack of suitable clean tonnage  much of which was drawn to the middle east where loadings to the far east were heavy 
rates continued to rise into the third quarter  reaching  per day by late september as consumers in the us and europe attempted to secure heating oil supplies ahead of winter as inventories remained historically low  particularly in the us northeast 
the announcement of the release of million barrels of crude from the strategic petroleum reserves in late september contributed to a weakening in tce rates to  per day by early november 
however  colder than normal temperatures in the us and continued lack of available suitable tonnage due to strong products demand in the far east lifted tce rates to  by the end of the year 
rates were near  in late january  little affected by opec s announcement of a cutback in crude output 
the average rate for larger panamax products carriers trading to the far east in was  twice as high as the previous year 
strong asian oil demand growth in the face of unscheduled refinery maintenance and startup problems  supported a rise in tce rates from  per day at the start of the year to  per day by the end of the first quarter 
increases in products carriers activity on the middle east to japan route and in the movement of gasoline cargoes from asia to the us west coast  where certain blends were in scarce supply  supported a steady increase in rates to  per day by late november 
continued rising oil product demand in the far east led to an increasing scarcity of large products carriers  pushing rates in december through late january to a high of  per day 
the switching of clean petroleum tankers into the dirty trades  to take advantage of strong crude tanker demand  earlier in the year contributed to the shortage of products carriers in the fourth quarter 
tce rates for large modern capesize vessels about  dwt averaged  in  double the level attained in a sharp year over year pickup in iron and steel output in asia and europe stimulated a corresponding increase in iron ore imports  providing a significant boost for capesize employment 
an uptrend in tce rates that began in the summer of sustained itself well into the fourth quarter of when it became evident that steel production growth was slowing down 
rates declined to  per day by late january from the november high of  per day 
the company s two foreign flag bulk carriers participate in a pool consisting of approximately modern capesize dry bulk carriers 
as one indication of recent trends in various charter markets  set forth below are selected average daily spot market rates for various types and sizes of vessels in both and based on the published reports of clarkson research studies  a well known industry research organization 
it is important to note that rates tend to fluctuate significantly over the course of time  and can vary widely based on factors such as the age  condition and position of a particular vessel 
furthermore  the conversion of worldscale rates to representative time charter equivalent rates per day requires the assumption of certain parameters for brokerage commissions  waiting time  port costs  speed and fuel consumption  all of which vary in actual usage 
accordingly  the rates shown are not necessarily indicative of rates achieved by the company s vessels during either year 
average market tce rates by vessel type tankers modern vlccs   aframaxes caribbean market   products carriers worldwide   dry bulk carriers capesize   for routes on which the company s modern vlccs typically trade 
income from vessel operations of approximately  in increased by  from the results for the improvement resulted from significant increases in time charter equivalent rates achieved by all classes of the company s foreign flag tonnage 
vlccs and modern aframaxes accounted for  or of the improvement in foreign flag vessel operations  as tces improved by approximately  and  per day  respectively  compared with because six of its vlccs and all of its aframaxes traded in the spot market  the company benefited significantly from the most attractive vlcc and aframax rate environment in more than years 
foreign flag products carriers and the two capesize bulk carriers contributed  and  to the improvement in results  as tces rose by approximately  and  per day  respectively 
with tce rates for such products carriers improving dramatically   of the  improvement for this vessel class was achieved in the fourth quarter of weaker results from the four us flag vessels participating in the us grain trades reduced income from vessel operations by approximately  in compared with the impact of the conversion of long term time charters on five us flag crude carriers to bareboat charters is discussed below 
operating results for reflect a decline of approximately revenue days from such decline  the substantial portion of which occurred in the first quarter of  was attributable to the sale of the company s three older suezmaxes in late and an increase in idle days for us flag tonnage participating in the us grain trades  partially offset by the delivery of two vlccs in the first half of the results for benefited from further fleet wide reductions in running expenses in excess of per day  per vessel 
significantly higher average bunker prices in partially offset the benefit of increases in freight rates  average bunker prices paid in rose more than from this increase came on top of a increase in average bunker prices in compared with the conversion of long term time charters on five us flag crude carriers in the second quarter of to bareboat charters  with bp amoco guarantees  resulted in reductions in tce revenues in all in the first half of of approximately  vessel running expenses  however  attributable to these five vessels decreased by approximately the same amount as the reduction in tce revenues since under the bareboat charters such expenses are the responsibility of the charterer 
accordingly  these reductions in revenue had no material effect on income from vessel operations 
the increased time charter hire expense in principally reflects the august sale and leaseback of the five vessels referred to in the preceding paragraph one of which was sold in october and is net of amortization of the related deferred gain 
such increase in shipping expenses is partially offset by a reduction in depreciation in of  resulting from the removal of these five vessels from the consolidated balance sheet 
the net reduction in results from vessel operations for of approximately  is offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the application of the net proceeds received from the sale and leaseback transaction of approximately  to reduce outstanding debt 
the balance of the increase in time charter hire expense in was attributable to the company s share approximately  of the cost of short term time charters in entered into by participants in the capesize bulk carriers pool 
income from vessel operations for of approximately  decreased by approximately  from the results for results from vessel operations for benefited from both reductions in corporate overhead of approximately  and a fleet wide reduction in running expenses in excess of per day  per vessel 
the results  however  were adversely affected by lower rates and significantly higher bunker prices  average bunker prices of approximately per ton in exceeded the average for by over 
income from foreign flag vessel operations decreased by approximately  from the results for  reflecting a  per day average tce rate decline for the company s foreign flag tankers 
the decrease in vlcc rates represented the majority of the reduction in income from foreign flag vessel operations  with tce rates for this vessel class averaging  per day below those obtained in during the fourth quarter  vlcc rates declined to their lowest level for the year 
tce rates for the company s aframaxes averaged  per day below those obtained in foreign flag operating results for were also negatively affected by a decline of approximately revenue days  attributable to the sale of two older tankers in the first quarter of and a significant increase in the number of days in drydock 
results from vessel operations for benefited from a reduction in depreciation of  attributable to the sale of certain older and less efficient tankers held for disposal at year end income from operations of the company s us flag fleet for improved by approximately  from this was partially attributable to improved results of two small dry cargo ships that had been laid up for substantial portions of the total number of revenue days for the us flag fleet in was not significantly different from the second quarter conversion of long term time charters on five us flag crude carriers to bareboat charters resulted in reductions in tce revenue of  in vessel running expenses  however  attributable to these five vessels decreased by approximately the same amount 
accordingly  this reduction in revenue had no material effect on income from vessel operations 
results from vessel operations in benefited from reduced depreciation of approximately  principally resulting from both the extension of the depreciable lives of four of these us flag crude carriers whose underlying charters were extended to their opa expiry dates in  and the sale and leaseback transaction 
since late december  the company s us flag car carrier has received  per year under the us maritime security program  which continues through  subject to annual congressional appropriations 
equity in results of bulk shipping joint ventures the improvement in the results of bulk shipping joint ventures in compared with was attributable to the inclusion of the results of a interest in a built vlcc and a interest in a built aframax tanker that were acquired during  and an increase in the company s share of incentive hire earned by alaska tanker company  llc 
as part of the reserve taken in connection with planned vessel dispositions  the company recorded a provision of approximately   after tax to reduce to estimated realizable value its proportionate share of the carrying amounts of certain vessels that were held in joint ventures and scheduled for disposal in  this provision was reflected in the results of bulk shipping joint ventures 
all of these vessels were sold in  resulting in an aggregate gain of approximately  the company s share of such gain  approximately  on a pre tax basis  is reflected in the results of bulk shipping joint ventures 
other income interest income in includes approximately  related to a federal income tax refund  which covered open years through interest expense interest expense increased by approximately  in compared with principally as a result of an increase of basis points in the average rate paid on floating rate debt approximately for 
the impact of such rate increase was substantially offset by increased amounts capitalized in connection with vessel construction   in compared with  in the average amount of debt outstanding in was relatively unchanged from despite payments in connection with the construction of vessels exceeding  during interest expense decreased by approximately  in compared with approximately  of this decrease was attributable to a reduction in the average amount of debt outstanding that was achieved despite  of progress payments made in in connection with the company s vessel construction program 
such reduction reflects the application of the proceeds of approximately  from a sale and leaseback transaction and  net of taxes  from the sale of  shares of royal caribbean cruises ltd 
rccl common stock in the first quarter of and gross proceeds of approximately   in and  in from the sale of eight older tankers held for disposal at year end and the vessels included in the dry cargo disposal program 
interest expense is net of amounts capitalized in connection with vessel construction of  in and  in in addition  during  the company repurchased debentures and notes  with an aggregate principal amount of  and  in the fourth quarter of  refinanced  of unsecured senior notes with coupons averaging  by borrowing under its revolving credit agreement 
such refinancing and repurchases of senior notes reduced annual interest costs by approximately  based on amounts outstanding and effective interest rates at the time of the respective transactions  which accounted for the balance of the expense decrease 
interest expense in  and reflects   and  respectively  of net benefits from the interest rate swaps referred to in liquidity and sources of capital 
provision for federal income taxes the income tax provisions in and and the tax credit in were based on pre tax income or loss  adjusted to reflect items that are not subject to tax and the dividends received deduction 
the tax provision in reflects the release of approximately  of reserves in connection with the settlement of federal tax audits covering open years through the credit for federal income taxes includes approximately  of tax on previously untaxed cruise earnings 
cumulative effect of accounting change the company changed its accounting policy effective january  for the recognition of net voyage revenues of vessels operating on voyage charters to the percentage of completion method 
prior years financial statements have not been restated 
net income for includes  net of related income taxes  from the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
assuming the above percentage of completion method had been applied retroactively  the pro forma income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for would have been reduced by  to  or 
per basic and diluted share 
the pro forma loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for would have been increased by  to  or per basic and diluted share 
new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as amended  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the company will adopt the new statement effective january  fas will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the portion of a derivative s change in fair value that is deemed not to constitute a hedge will be immediately recognized in earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedges  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against changes in fair value of the hedged items and reflected in earnings  or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is reflected in earnings 
the company believes that the adoption of fas will not have a material effect on its earnings and financial position 
liquidity and sources of capital working capital at december  was approximately  compared with  at year end and  at year end current assets are highly liquid  consisting principally of cash  interest bearing deposits  investments in marketable securities and receivables 
in addition  the company maintains a capital construction fund with a market value of approximately  at december  net cash provided by operating activities approximated  in   in and  in current financial resources  together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations  are expected to be adequate to meet financial requirements in the next year 
in april  the company concluded an unsecured revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings of up to  on a revolving credit basis  through april in connection therewith  the company s existing long term credit facility was reduced from  to  this resulted in a net increase in long term credit availability to  of which  was used at december  the company also has an unsecured short term credit facility of  all of which was unused at december  the company finances vessel additions primarily with cash provided by operating activities and long term borrowings 
long term borrowings incurred in  and aggregated approximately   and  respectively 
the company has used interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of its debt  including capital lease obligations  either from a fixed to floating rate basis or from floating to fixed rate  reflecting management s interest rate outlook at various times 
these agreements contain no leverage features and have various maturity dates from mid to the company has hedged its exchange rate risk with respect to contracted future charter revenues receivable in japanese yen to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on reported income by entering into currency swaps with a major financial institution to deliver such foreign currency at fixed rates that will result in the company receiving approximately  for such foreign currency from through in  and  cash used for vessel additions approximated   and  respectively  excluding additions financed by long term borrowings 
as of february   the company has commitments for the construction of nine double hulled foreign flag tankers for delivery between late february and early january  with an aggregate unpaid cost of approximately  unpaid costs are net of progress payments and prepayments  which are covered by refundment guaranties  principally from major us insurance companies 
a foreign flag aframax tanker with an unpaid cost of approximately  as of december  was delivered in early february risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages this exposure to market risk through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that reflects management s interest rate outlook at various times 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements  in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts 
the company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage exposure to nonperformance on such instruments by the counterparties 
the following tables provide information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
