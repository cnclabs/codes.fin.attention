item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page for a chart of hotel operating data for and how boykin applies its business strategies a 
internal growth from strong management  renovation  and development and repositioning strong management performance we believe that the revenue and cash flow from our hotels will be maximized by intensive management and marketing 
we intend to derive increased cash flow through the application of our lessees operating strategies  which include active hotel revenue maximization also referred to as effective yield management 
we believe that our lessees commitment to customer service and the experience of their management teams positions us to capitalize on the expected continuing demand in our markets 
we also believe that  based on our historical operating results  the location of our hotels  and the strength of our own and our lessees management teams  the portfolio should provide us with the opportunity for cash flow growth through the percentage leases 
capital expenditure and renovation strategy we believe that our regular program of capital improvements at our hotels  including replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures  and equipment  helps maintain and enhance their competitiveness and maximizes revenue growth under the percentage leases 
consistent with this strategy  we have made significant renovations at several of our hotels since our ipo 
in   and we spent million  million  and million  respectively on renovations 
this represented percent  percent  and percent of   and hotel revenues  respectively  significantly above the hotel industry standard of percent 
development  expansion and repositioning strategy we may develop additional full service or upscale limited service hotels on land that we acquire in our current geographic markets or on land contiguous to our hotels 
we believe that selective development of hotels in our existing geographic markets could enable us to take advantage of operating efficiencies to generate attractive returns on our investment 
we may also expand our existing hotels and or reposition under performing hotels by changing the franchise brand affiliation 
since our ipo  we have reflagged repositioned three hotels and expect to reposition our newly acquired southfield doubletree suites as an embassy suites after an approximate million renovation in in the fall of  we also expect to commence an approximate million renovation of the executive plaza hotel in chicago  illinois  which would reposition this property to the quality of a four star hotel 
we are currently 
table of contents evaluating a potential expansion opportunity at our melbourne beach hilton  which  if we proceed  would commence in over the past two years  we have perfected zoning rights to expand our pink shell beach resort by rooms 
if we proceed with the project  our plan is to demolish cottage units  or about of the rooms at the resort 
we would then construct a unit tower that would significantly upgrade the character of the resort 
the plan is for the units in the new tower to be sold as condominiums  with the expectation that the owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort by contract 
as with any renovation  the shorter term effects may be a lower revpar and revenues  due to the demolition of the cottage units 
we plan to make the decision to proceed with this project when we have pre sold a significant portion of condominiums and  although we are very encouraged by the preliminary interest we have seen  we don t expect to know that until late second quarter early third quarter of b 
acquisitions we believe that the upscale and moderate market segments of the hospitality industry will present attractive acquisition opportunities 
our acquisition strategy focuses on the following categories product type full service commercial hotels  airport hotels  major tourist hotels and destination resorts in major markets and business centers 
market repositioning opportunities undervalued hotels whose occupancy  daily rates and overall revenues can be significantly enhanced through new brand affiliations and or implementation of new marketing strategies which will maximize revenues and profitability 
redevelopment and renovation opportunities hotels with sound operational fundamentals that  because of a lack of capital  require physical renovation to achieve their full performance potential  and other properties which can benefit from total redevelopment and market repositioning 
portfolio acquisitions portfolios of hotels which result in geographic economies of scale or which may be leased back to proven hotel operators as additional lessees  and that may benefit from our repositioning and redevelopment experience and access to capital 
we intend to maintain a geographically diversified hotel portfolio and may also cluster hotels within certain primary markets in order to take advantage of operational and managerial economies of scale 
we will acquire or develop additional hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise  and will not undertake acquisition or development of properties unless adequate sources of capital and financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from capital obtained from borrowings under our credit facility or other borrowings  from the proceeds of the sale of non strategic hotels  from additional issuances of common shares or other securities and from cash flows from operations 
c 
strategic alliances and relationships our strategic alliances and relationships fall into two primary areas franchise brand strategy operator and joint venture strategy franchise brand strategy we focus on owning hotel properties that are  or can be  associated with brands that will lead the hospitality industry in revpar  such as marriott  radisson  hilton  doubletree  holiday inn  hampton inns  quality suites  hyatt  renaissance  omni  and embassy suites 
we believe that we can maximize our market share and revenue by taking advantage of our orientation toward sales and marketing to identify the most effective branding and to leverage our brands with effective direct sales strategies 
we expect to continue to affiliate with a number of different franchisors in order to maximize the performance of our hotels by providing greater access to a broad base of national marketing and reservation 
table of contents systems  and to mitigate the risks of franchise loss and franchise overlap 
we believe that our relationships with certain franchisors facilitate finding acquisition opportunities and completing acquisitions on attractive terms 
operator and joint venture strategy we lease our properties to established hotel operators pursuant to percentage lease agreements  which provide us with the greater of a base rental income or a percentage of revenues from operations 
in selecting operators  we seek hotel managers with demonstrated full service hotel expertise  a stable operating and financial performance history  an excellent reputation in the hospitality industry  an ability to introduce additional acquisition opportunities to us  and to lease additional hotels from us

table of contents terms of the percentage lease agreements the following summary of the material terms of the percentage leases is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of percentage lease  which was filed as an exhibit to our registration statement on form s registration statement no 
 filed on june   as amended 
the percentage lease agreements have the material terms described below duration 
non cancelable remaining terms ranging from less than one year to eight years  subject to earlier termination on the occurrence of certain contingencies described in the percentage leases 
the majority of the percentage leases do not contain renewal terms and those with renewal options are subject to agreement between the parties regarding market terms 
amounts payable under the percentage leases 
lessees are obligated to pay to boykin i the higher of minimum rent or percentage rent  except for the french lick springs resort  for which both minimum rent and percentage rent are required to be paid 
minimum rent is a fixed amount determined by negotiation between us and the applicable lessee and is payable monthly 
percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room and other revenue and gross food and beverage revenue  over specified threshold amounts 
percentage rent is payable quarterly 
both the threshold gross room and other revenue amounts used in computing percentage rent and minimum rent are adjusted annually for changes in the united states consumer price index 
ii certain other amounts  including interest accrued on any late payment or charge 
each lease also requires the lessee to pay all costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the hotel 
the lessee is required to maintain the hotel in good order and repair and to make necessary nonstructural repairs 
we fund capital expenditures as we consider necessary and as required by our franchisors 
insurance and property taxes 
we pay  or cause the lessee to pay  real estate and personal property taxes and maintain  or cause the lessee to maintain  property insurance  including casualty insurance  on our hotels 
the lessee maintains comprehensive general public liability  workers compensation  month rental interruption and any other insurance customary for properties similar to the hotel or required by any relevant franchisor and must have us named as an additional insured 
we believe that the insurance coverage carried by each hotel is adequate in scope and amount

the lessee indemnifies us against all liabilities  costs and expenses incurred by  imposed on or asserted against us  on account of  among other things accidents or injury to persons or property on or about the hotel  negligence by the lessee or any of its agents  certain environmental liabilities resulting from conditions existing at the time of the lease execution  taxes and assessments in respect of the hotel other than our real estate taxes and income taxes on income attributable to the hotel  the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages on the hotel property  and any breach of the lease by the lessee

table of contents termination of the franchise agreement covering any hotel leased to the lessee  and with respect to bmc  any failure to comply with bmc s covenants  as described on page bmc  westboy and chiboy 
in the event of default under any lease with bmc  we may terminate the lease and any or all of the other percentage leases with bmc  and bmc will be required to surrender possession of the affected hotels 
if an event of default under any lease with any other lessee occurs  we may terminate the lease and the lessee will be required to surrender possession of the affected hotel 
recent reit legislation congress recently enacted legislation which will dramatically change the tax rules applicable to hotel reits 
effective in  reits will be able to operate certain businesses through a taxable reit subsidiary trs  which  in the past  would have jeopardized their tax free status 
for hotel reits  this means that starting in  our hotel properties can be leased to a trs we own  as long as the trs hires an independent hotel operator to manage the properties 
our board of directors has appointed a special committee to evaluate how a trs could benefit our shareholders 
we believe that we will be in a position to announce specific plans later in franchise agreements our hotels are operated under franchise license agreements with premier nationally recognized hotel chains  including doubletree marriott radisson hilton holiday inn quality suites hampton inns our french lick springs resort in french lick  indiana operates as an independent hotel 
we expect that most of the additional hotel properties that we acquire will be operated under franchise agreements 
we believe that the public s perception of quality associated with a franchisor can be an important feature in the operation of a hotel 
franchisors provide a variety of benefits for franchisees  including national advertising  publicity and other marketing programs designed to increase brand awareness  training of personnel  continuous review of quality standards and centralized reservation systems 
the expiration dates for the hotels franchise agreements range from august  to september   which  in some cases  may be extended for additional terms 
the franchise agreements generally impose certain management  operational  record keeping  accounting  reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchised operator must comply 
some of the key provisions of the franchise agreements include the following each franchise agreement gives the lessee operator the right to operate the franchised hotel under a franchise for a period of years specified in that agreement 
the franchise agreements provide for early termination at the franchisor s option on the occurrence of certain events of default  such as the failure to properly maintain the hotel 
the lessees operators are responsible to pay franchise fees ranging from to of gross room sales and advertising or marketing and reservation fees generally ranging from to of gross room sales 
notification must be given to the franchisor upon the sale of a hotel giving the franchisor rights  as defined in its franchise agreement  ranging from consent to the transfer of ownership  the franchisor s ability to match an offer for sale  or the right to terminate the franchise agreement 
several of the franchise agreements can be terminated upon sale by the franchisee 

table of contents employees we currently have eighteen employees 
these employees perform  directly or through the partnership  various acquisition  development  redevelopment and corporate management functions 
inventory working capital assets required in the operation of our hotels are generally provided by the lessees at their expense 
environmental matters under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances  and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum on  under or in the property 
this liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the substances 
other federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations and the common law impose on owners and operators certain requirements regarding conditions and activities that may affect human health or the environment 
failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in difficulty in the lease or sale of any affected property or the imposition of monetary penalties  in addition to the costs required to achieve compliance and potential liability to third parties 
we may be potentially liable for such costs or claims in connection with the ownership and operation of the current hotels and hotels we may acquire in the future 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  nor are we otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or to other environmental matters in connection with any of our hotels 
nonetheless  it is possible that material environmental contamination or conditions exist  or could arise in the future  in the hotels or on the land upon which they are located which could create a material environmental liability 
further  there can be no assurance that the hotels that we may acquire will not give rise to any material environmental liability 
competition the principal methods of competition for each of our hotels are i brand affiliation  ii room rates  iii customer service  iv location  and v the condition and upkeep of each hotel in general and in relation to other hotels in its local market 
we believe that we are well positioned in each category 
we have affiliated with a network of high quality franchisors 
we believe that our lessees emphasis on customer service and their strong and active yield management enables us to maximize revenues at each hotel 
while new hotels in certain of our markets have caused us to experience lower than expected lease revenues from some of our hotels  our hotels are generally located in areas that generate demand such as airport hotels  major tourist locations  and major cities or business centers 
we also believe our strong commitment to regular capital improvements  including the replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment  helps improve our competitive position 
each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties 
the occupancy  adr and revpar of any hotel or any hotel property acquired in the future could be materially and adversely affected by the number of competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition for potential acquisitions may generally reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell 
seasonality the operations at our hotels historically have been seasonal 
twenty eight of the hotels maintain higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
our four hotels in florida experience their highest occupancy in the first quarter 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease payments received under the percentage leases

we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating  financing and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and fund other cash needs 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the nareit definition differently than us 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

boykin lodging company currently has a ownership interest in  is the sole general partner of and does all its business through the partnership 
since the ipo  we have acquired hotels including the ten hotel portfolio discussed below by raising capital through a combination of common share issuances  various debt financings  capital from strategic joint venture partners and cash flow generated from operations 
in  we raised net proceeds of approximately million in a follow on public equity offering of million common shares 
in the same year  we acquired a portfolio of ten doubletree licensed hotels through a merger with red lion inns limited partnership valued at million 
in the transaction  we issued million common shares  paid million in cash to the red lion partners and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
at the end of  we had million of debt outstanding under various debt instruments 
we currently have strategic alliances with three hotel operators and own four hotels with them through joint venture structures 
in  we also formed a joint venture with aew partners iii  lp aew and  through that joint venture  we purchased a hotel located in downtown chicago 
at the end of  we owned interests in hotels containing a total of  guest rooms located in different states 
we sold one hotel in january our principal source of revenue is lease payments from lessees pursuant to percentage lease agreements 
percentage lease revenue is based upon the room  food and beverage and other revenues of our hotels 
the lessees ability to make payments to us pursuant to the percentage leases is dependent primarily upon the operations of the hotels 

table of contents results of operations the following discusses our results of operations for compared to and compared to because the rent we collect from bmc and its subsidiaries constitutes a significant portion of our lease revenues  we believe that a discussion of the historical and pro forma operations of bmc is also important to understand our business 
the pro forma information of bmc is presented as if our march acquisitions of two hotels leased by bmc and our august acquisition of the executive plaza hotel leased by chiboy  a wholly owned subsidiary of bmc  were consummated as of january  boykin lodging company results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended our percentage lease revenue increased to million in from million in this increase was due to increased percentage lease revenues from our lessees of million  offset by a million decrease in percentage lease revenue attributable to our foreclosure of the radisson hotel mt 
laurel lease in february from the prior lessee 
instead of percentage lease revenues  the hotel s revenues of million and hotel operating expenses of million are reflected in the results of operations in the overall impact of the foreclosure was a decrease in net income of 
million in percentage lease revenue payable by bmc is million  or of total percentage lease revenue in  compared to million  or of percentage lease revenues the main driver of our percentage lease revenues is the hotel s revenues  which are driven by adr  occupancy  and revpar 
during  the adr at our comparable hotels including the executive plaza hotel acquired in but not consolidated in boykin s results of operations increased to compared to in the weighted average occupancy decreased to from in this resulted in a increase in revpar to in  compared to in the following table sets forth the pro forma operating data of the hotels owned by us as of december   without regard to when we acquired the hotels

the initial term 
table of contents of westboy s percentage lease agreement expires december  westboy has the option  but not the obligation  to renew the lease for additional five year terms  or may negotiate new terms acceptable to both westboy and olp 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of bmc included in this form k for selected financial information related to westboy 
for the year ended december   westboy recognized a net loss of million 
in the opinion of management  westboy should be able to continue making its percentage lease payments over the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that westboy will be able to continue making percentage lease payments at the current rate over the long term 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the new lease terms with westboy  or any other party  after will be made at the current rate 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and million of restricted cash for the payment of capital expenditures  real estate tax and insurance 
we had outstanding borrowings totaling million and million against our credit facility and term notes payable  respectively 
in january and february  we repaid a net million on our line of credit  thus reducing our current outstanding borrowings to million 
in july  we refinanced our million credit facility with a new million credit facility and a million secured term loan 
we currently have million outstanding under the new credit facility  with the unused amount available to fund hotel acquisitions  renovations  capital expenditures  and working capital needs  as limited under terms of the credit agreements 
for information relating to the terms of our new credit facility and our million  million and million term notes payable  see notes and  respectively  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of boykin lodging company included in this form k 
we may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate  and be subject to such other terms as the board of directors considers prudent 
the availability of borrowings under the credit facility is restrained by borrowing base and loan to value limits  as well as other financial performance covenants contained in the agreement 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available in anticipated amounts from the credit facility 
we have an active shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million in securities 
securities issued under this registration statement may be preferred shares  depository shares  common shares or any combination thereof  and may be issued at different times  depending on market conditions 
warrants to purchase these securities may also be issued 
the terms of issuance of any securities covered by this registration statement would be determined at the time of their offering 
effective with our third quarter dividend  we reduced our quarterly dividend rate from to per share 
the reduced dividend rate may improve our liquidity by allowing us to retain additional funds for reinvestment 
in this capital constrained environment  we believe it is critical to retain some cash to keep our properties in excellent competitive condition and to take advantage of high yield internal growth opportunities 
no assurance can be given that we will make distributions in the future at the current rate  or at all 
in  we expect to spend approximately million in renovations at our hotels  excluding the pink shell and chicago executive plaza projects discussed below 
this includes renovating the guestrooms and public space at our newly acquired doubletree guest suites in southfield  michigan at a cost of approximately million  which will be reflagged as an embassy suites 
it also includes completing guestroom renovations at our berkeley marina radisson  hunt valley marriott and columbus marriott 
we expect to use cash available from operations and restricted capital expenditure reserves  as well as borrowings under our line of credit  to fund our renovations 
over the past two years  we have perfected zoning rights to expand our pink shell beach resort by rooms 
if we proceed with the project  our plan is to demolish cottage units  or about of the rooms at the resort 
we would then construct a unit tower that would significantly upgrade the character of the resort and sell these units as condos  with the expectation that the condo owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort 
we would to use our line of credit to fund the approximate mid million project cost  and use the proceeds from the condo sales to pay back the line of credit 
we would also expect to reap a significant gain on the sale of the condos  and ultimately increase our bottom line at the resort 
as with any renovation  the 
table of contents shorter term effects may be a lower revpar and revenues  due to the demolition of the cottage units 
we plan to make the decision to proceed with this project when we have pre sold a significant portion of condos and  although we are very encouraged by the preliminary interest we have seen  we don t expect to know that until late second quarter early third quarter of in the fall of  we expect to commence the renovation of the executive plaza hotel in chicago  illinois  of which we would provide approximately million of equity funding utilizing availability under our line of credit 
inflation our revenues are from percentage leases  which can change based on changes in the revenues of our hotels  as well as from cpi adjustments in the percentage lease rent formulas which are adjusted each year accordingly with the cpi 
therefore  we rely entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees ability to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and our lessees  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees ability to raise rates to keep pace with inflation 
our general and administrative costs as well as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent are subject to inflation 
seasonality our hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
twenty eight of our hotels maintain higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
the four currently owned hotels located in florida experience their highest occupancy in the first quarter 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease payments received under the percentage leases 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient to make distributions during any quarter because of temporary or seasonal fluctuations in percentage lease revenue  we expect to utilize cash on hand or borrowings to make those distributions 
no assurance can be given that we will make distributions in the future at the current rate  or at all 
competition and other economic factors our hotels are located in developed areas that contain other hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr and revpar of any hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number of or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area  specifically  reducing our percentage lease revenues 
because of competition from newly constructed hotels in certain markets  we have recently experienced lower than expected percentage lease revenues from our hotels in these markets and we expect this trend to continue into competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities  or our ability to sell existing properties 
as a portion of the lodging industry s sales are based upon business  commercial and leisure travel  changes in general economic conditions  demographics  or changes in local business economics  could affect these and other travel segments 
this may affect demand for rooms  which would affect hotel revenues and therefore percentage lease revenues 
new accounting pronouncements effective january  we will adopt the provisions of sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
these debt instruments include our new million secured credit facility  our million secured term loan  our million term loan and our share of boykin chicago s million term note payable 
we have entered into both variable and fixed rate debt arrangements to allow us to optimize the balance of using variable rate debt versus fixed rate debt 
our variable rate debt allows us to maximize financial flexibility when selling properties and minimize potential prepayment penalties on fixed rate loans 
our million  fixed rate term note allows us to minimize our interest rate risk exposure 
in march  we also purchased interest protection on million of our floating rate debt that fixes the overall interest rate on this debt at no more than 
based on the new interest protection  approximately of our outstanding debt at december  is fixed rate in nature  compared with at the end of the weighted average interest rate of our variable rate debt was for the year ended december  we review interest rate exposure quarterly in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
it is our policy to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates on our borrowings  through the use of fixed rate debt instruments  to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements  and after considering the need for financial flexibility related to our debt arrangements 
we may enter into forward interest rate agreements  or similar agreements  to hedge our variable rate debt instruments where we believe the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  we would be entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  we would make payments in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
other than the interest protection agreement discussed above  we do not have any other material market sensitive financial instruments 
we do not believe that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on the performance or fair value of our hotel portfolio as the value of our hotel portfolio is based primarily on the operating cash flow of the hotels  before interest expense charges 
however  a change of in the index rate to which our variable rate debt is tied would change our annual interest incurred by 
million  based upon the balances outstanding on our variable rate instruments at december
