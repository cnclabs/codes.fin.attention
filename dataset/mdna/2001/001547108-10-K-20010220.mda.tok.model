item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is set forth in item ak steel s other operations consist of sawhill tubular products  douglas dynamics  llc and greens port industrial park 
sawhill tubular  with three plants located in ohio and pennsylvania  manufactures a wide range of steel pipe and tubing products for the non residential construction  industrial  plumbing and heating markets 
douglas dynamics manufactures snowplows and ice control products for four wheel drive light trucks at plants in maine  tennessee and wisconsin 
its products are sold under the brand names western and fisher through independent distributors in the united states and canada 
greens port industrial park  which consists of approximately acres on the houston  texas ship channel  leases land  buildings and rail car storage facilities to third parties and operates a deep water loading dock on the channel 
customers ak steel s flat rolled carbon steel products are sold primarily to automotive manufacturers and to customers in the appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  consisting principally of manufacturers of home appliances  heating  ventilation and air conditioning equipment and lighting products 
hot rolled  cold rolled and semi finished steel products are also sold to distributors  service centers and convertors who may further process these products or resell them without further processing 
ak steel sells its stainless steel products primarily to customers in the automotive industry  as well as to manufacturers of food handling  chemical processing  pollution control and medical and health equipment 
electrical steels  which are iron silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties  are sold primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers  electrical motors and generators  and lighting ballasts 
in conducting its steel operations  ak steel s marketing efforts are principally directed toward those customers  such as automotive manufacturers  who require precise on time delivery  technical support and the highest quality flat rolled steel 
management believes that ak steel s enhanced product quality and delivery capabilities  and its emphasis on customer technical support and product planning  are critical factors in its ability to serve this segment of the market 
the following table sets forth the percentage of the steel operations net sales attributable to various markets years ended december  automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and convertors between and  ak steel s steel operations sales increased 
while automotive market sales dollars remained flat between and  they declined as a percentage of total sales as sales to other markets continued to increase 
the steel operations segment is a major supplier to general motors  ford motor company and daimlerchrysler ag 
shipments to general motors  ak steel s largest customer  accounted for approximately  and of steel operations net sales in  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales for any of these years 
ak steel is party to agreements with all of its major automotive and most appliance industry customers with terms that range from one to three years 
these agreements  which are typically finalized late in the year  set forth prices to be paid for each product category during each year of their term 
except for nickel and chrome  where surcharges may be passed on to the customer  these agreements do not permit adjustment to reflect changes in prevailing market conditions or raw material costs 
during most periods  approximately of ak steel s sales of flat rolled steel products are made pursuant to these agreements  with the balance being made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale 
however  due to a reduction in demand from contract customers during the fourth quarter of  contract sales in the quarter were approximately of total flat rolled sales  resulting in a higher percentage of shipments to the depressed spot market 
raw materials the principal raw materials required for ak steel s steel manufacturing operations are carbon and stainless steel scrap  iron ore  coal  electricity  natural gas  oxygen  chrome  nickel  silicon  molybdenum  zinc  limestone and other commodity materials 
in addition  ak steel purchases carbon steel slabs from other steel producers to supplement the production from its own steelmaking facilities 
purchases of coal  iron ore and limestone  as well as transportation services  are made at negotiated prices under multi year agreements 
purchases of carbon steel slabs  stainless steel scrap  natural gas and other raw materials are made at prevailing market prices  which are subject to price fluctuations in accordance with supply and demand 
during  ak steel incurred substantially higher costs for natural gas  as well as for steel slabs and scrap 
while prices for natural gas are likely to remain high and may even increase further  ak steel believes that adequate sources of supply exist for all of its raw material and energy requirements 
employees as of december   the company had approximately  employees 
approximately  employees at seven of ak steel s thirteen plants are represented by international  national or independent unions  under contracts with expiration dates extending through labor contracts covering employees at the following plant locations expire in of total contract location union employees expiration date ashland works paper  allied industrial  chemical and energy workers april  butler works butler armco independent union hourly september  ak steel s mansfield works was one of the facilities owned and operated by armco prior to its merger with ak steel on september  on september   the contract between armco and the united steelworkers of america covering approximately hourly workers  including on layoff status  at the mansfield works expired 
because of production slowdowns  vandalism and threats of violence on the part of union members  armco informed the union  and the company understood  that it would lock out represented employees while it continued to bargain with the union 
since september  the mansfield works has been operated by salaried employees and temporary replacement workers 
competition ak steel competes with domestic and foreign flat rolled carbon  stainless and electrical steel producers and producers of plastics  aluminum and other materials that can be used in lieu of flat rolled steels in manufactured products 
price  service  quality and delivery are the primary competitive factors and vary in relative importance according to the category of product and customer requirements 
domestic steel producers face significant competition from foreign producers who typically have lower labor costs 
in addition  many foreign steel producers are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments and their decisions with respect to production and sales may be influenced more by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions 
environmental matters domestic steel producers  including ak steel  are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
over the past three years  ak steel has expended the following for environmental related capital investments and environmental compliance costs years ended december  in millions environmental related capital investments environmental compliance costs management does not anticipate any material impact on ak steel s recurring operating costs or future profitability as a result of its compliance with current environmental regulations 
moreover  because all domestic steel producers operate under the same set of federal environmental regulations  management believes that ak steel is not competitively disadvantaged by its need to comply with these regulations 
environmental remediation ak steel and its predecessors have been conducting steel manufacturing and related operations for approximately years 
although their operating practices are believed to have been consistent with prevailing industry standards during this time  hazardous materials may have been released at one or more operating sites  including sites that are no longer owned by ak steel 
potential remediation expenditures have been estimated for those sites where future remediation efforts are probable based on identified conditions  regulatory requirements or contractual obligations arising from the sale of a business 
pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  handling and disposal of hazardous waste  the united states environmental protection agency epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there have been releases of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into the environment and order the facilities to take corrective action to remediate such releases 
the company s major steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra inspections by environmental regulators 
while the company cannot predict the future actions of these regulators  the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities 
under authority conferred by the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the epa and state environmental authorities have conducted site investigations at certain of ak steel s facilities  portions of which previously had been used for disposal of materials that are currently subject to regulation 
while the results of these investigations are still pending  in the future ak steel could be directed to expend funds for remedial activities at the former disposal areas 
given the uncertain status of these investigations  however  management is unable to predict if and when such expenditures might be required or their magnitude 
environmental proceedings federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the clean water act impose categorical pretreatment limits on the concentrations of various constituents in coke plant wastewater prior to discharge into publicly owned treatment works potw 
due to concentrations of ammonia and phenol in excess of these limits in wastewater from the middletown works  ak steel  through the middletown potw  petitioned the epa for removal credits  a type of compliance exemption  based on the middletown potw s satisfactory treatment of the wastewater for ammonia and phenol 
the epa declined to review the petition on the grounds that it had not yet promulgated new sludge management rules 
ak steel thereupon sought and obtained from the united states district court for the southern district of ohio an injunction prohibiting the epa from instituting enforcement action against ak steel for noncompliance with the pretreatment limitations  pending the epa s promulgation of the applicable sludge management regulations 
management is unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
however  if the epa eventually refuses to grant the petition for removal credits  ak steel could incur additional costs to construct pretreatment facilities at the middletown works 
on february   the ohio environmental protection agency oepa issued a notice of violation nov with respect to the zanesville works alleging noncompliance with both a order and various state regulations regarding hazardous waste management 
ak steel is continuing to work with the oepa and the ohio attorney general s office to achieve final resolution of this matter 
subsequent to a multi media inspection of middletown works during the fall of  the epa region v notified ak steel that legal proceedings had been initiated alleging violations of clean air act and clean water act regulations 
on june   the epa filed a complaint against ak steel in the u 
s 
district court for the southern district of ohio  for alleged violations of the clean air act  the clean water act and the rcra 
on the same date  ak steel filed a verified complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the court of common pleas for butler county  ohio against the state of ohio and the oepa seeking a declaration that a ak steel is in compliance with its operating permits for the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces at its middletown works  which would preclude the state of ohio and the oepa from taking any action to order or enforce obligations on ak steel with respect to those facilities  and b that any emissions from the middletown works do not cause  or otherwise contribute to  a public nuisance 
on june   the state of ohio moved to intervene in the epa action 
ak steel intends to vigorously contest this matter 
on september   armco received an order from the epa under section of rcra requiring armco to develop a plan for investigation of eight areas of the mansfield works that allegedly could be sources of contamination 
on october   armco filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio seeking pre enforcement review 
on april   the court dismissed the complaint on the basis that the statute did not allow pre enforcement review of agency orders 
thereafter  armco filed a motion for reconsideration  which was denied on october  the site investigation began in november and is continuing 
on june   the epa region iii issued to ak steel s butler works an emergency order order pursuant to the safe drinking water act  concerning discharge of nitrate nitrite compounds to the connoquenessing creek  an occasional water source for the borough of zelienople 
the order was issued without any prior notice to ak steel 
on june   ak steel filed a petition for review and a motion for emergency stay with the sixth circuit court of appeals 
on june   the sixth circuit issued an order denying ak steel s motion for emergency stay 
ak steel and the epa region iii are currently engaged in discussions in an effort to reach a settlement of this matter 
in addition to the foregoing matters  the company is or may be involved in proceedings with various regulatory authorities that may require the company to pay fines  comply with more rigorous standards or other requirements or incur capital and operating expenses for environmental compliance 
management believes that the ultimate disposition of the foregoing proceedings will not have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

in management s opinion  the ultimate liability resulting from all claims  individually or in the aggregate  will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on april   a purported class action was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio by bernard fidel against ak steel holding corporation and certain of its directors and officers  alleging material misstatements and omissions in the company s public disclosure about its business and operations 
the defendants intend to vigorously defend this action 
ak steel has filed a motion to dismiss the action  which currently is pending 
a number of lawsuits regarding asbestos exposure are pending and continue to be filed arising out of the operations of former armco facilities 
the majority of these lawsuits are filed in texas and arise out of armco s former houston works facility 
such cases typically involve a large number of plaintiffs claiming against a large number of defendants 
armco is normally named as a defendant by a small percentage of the overall plaintiffs who are typically frequenters independent contractors  delivery personnel  etc 
claiming that armco exposed them to asbestos while they were on the premises 
ak steel is actively and vigorously defending these cases

operations overview ak steel s principal business focus is its steel operations  which consist of seven steelmaking and finishing plants that produce flat rolled carbon steels  including premium quality coated cold rolled and hot rolled products  and specialty stainless and electrical steels that are sold in slab  hot band  and sheet and strip form 
these products are sold primarily to the domestic automotive  appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  as well as to distributors  service centers and convertors 
the company s other operations include sawhill tubular products  a manufacturer of a wide range of steel pipe and tubing products  douglas dynamics  llc  the largest north american manufacturer of snowplows and ice control products for four wheel drive light trucks  and an industrial park on the houston  texas ship channel 
compared to during  net sales were  an increase of from the  reported for steel operations contributed  to total net sales  compared to  for  an increase of 
these increases were due primarily to continued growth in the percentage of total shipments attributable to value added products  consisting primarily of stainless and electrical steels and coated and cold rolled carbon steels 
for the year  value added products  including tubular products  comprised approximately of total shipments  compared to for partly offsetting the improved product mix were significantly lower prices in the spot market 
during most periods  approximately of ak steel s sales of flat rolled steel products are made pursuant to multi year sales contracts  with the balance being made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale 
however  due to a reduction in demand from contract customers during the fourth quarter of  contract sales were approximately of total flat rolled sales in that quarter  resulting in a higher percentage of shipments to the depressed spot market 
total steel shipments during  inclusive of tubular products  declined slightly to  tons from the  tons shipped in  reflecting the company s closure  in january  of a redundant galvanizing facility in dover  ohio  which accounted for shipments of almost  tons in during  an increase in value added steel shipments was a result of the company s move toward a richer product mix 
steel operations shipments of  in were below shipments due to the dover closure 
operating profit in totaled  or per ton shipped  compared to the reported for excluding the merger related special charges  operating profit was  or per ton shipped 
steel operations operating profit was in and excluding the special charge in the slight decrease in operating profit in was due primarily to substantially higher costs in comparison to for steel scrap  purchased carbon steel slabs and  most particularly  natural gas and  to a lesser extent  to the significant decline in spot market prices and the increase in the percentage of the company s sales to the spot market during the fourth quarter of these negative factors were partly offset by increased shipments of value added products  which carry higher margins  higher than expected merger synergies and other cost savings achieved through more efficient utilization of production facilities 
interest expense increased in by over the prior year  due primarily to an reduction in the amount of interest that the company capitalized as a result of the completion of construction of its rockport works in the second half of this was partially offset by the retirement of certain debt in connection with the armco merger 
other income  consisting primarily of interest earned on cash balances  declined in due to lower average cash balances compared to during  the company incurred in income tax expense  a book tax rate of 
this amount included a noncash deferred tax provision of  primarily attributable to accelerated tax depreciation in excess of book  book pension credits in excess of actual funding of the pension plans  utilization or expiration of tax loss carryovers and related changes in the deferred tax asset valuation reserve 
partially offsetting the deferred tax provision was a credit for current taxes of  which included a federal tax refund that resulted from the carryback of a tax net operating loss generated in the income tax provision for is net of an recycling tax credit received from the commonwealth of kentucky in that year  but which related to prior years 
income from continuing operations for was  or per share  compared to  or per share  reported for excluding the special charge  minority interest  and certain other merger related adjustments  net of tax  income from continuing operations was from this amount  income from continuing operations decreased in  reflecting the lower adjusted operating income  higher interest expense and the decline in other income 
certain of armco s former businesses included operations in foreign countries 
at the time of their sale or closure  some of these operations had outstanding tax issues 
following consultation with advisors in those countries in  armco determined that it had resolved most of these issues and reversed a majority of the related reserves  recognizing income from discontinued operations of  or per share 
during  the company recorded a combined after tax extraordinary loss of  or per share  due to the early redemption of ak steel s senior notes due and armco s senior notes due net income in was  or per share  compared to the  or per share  reported for excluding the special charge  minority interest  and certain other merger related adjustments  as well as the income from discontinued operations and extraordinary loss  net of tax  income was from this amount  income decreased in  reflecting the lower adjusted operating income  higher interest expense and the decline in other income 
compared to net sales totaled  in versus  in shipments totaling  tons in were  tons above levels 
steel operations contributed  and  to the company s net sales in and  respectively  and  tons and  tons of its shipments in the same years 
the year to year increases reflect stronger demand for the company s products  particularly from the automotive industry 
shipments of value added products  including tubular products  constituted of total shipments  compared to in operating profit in  excluding special charges  was  or per ton shipped  compared to operating profit of  or per ton  in excluding the same special charges  steel operations contributed operating profit of and in and  respectively 
the decrease in operating profit is primarily due to higher depreciation at the rockport works and excess costs related to the mansfield labor dispute  partially offset by the improved product mix 
interest expense totaled in  an increase of over the increase was due  for the most part  to a reduction in the amount of interest that was capitalized as a result of the completion of construction of the rockport works 
following the merger of ak steel and armco  but effective as of january   the company conformed the ak steel and armco methods of amortizing unrecognized net gains and losses related to their obligations for pensions and other postretirement benefits  including conforming the measurement dates for actuarial valuations 
under the conformed method  the company recognizes immediately into income unrecognized net gains and losses that exceed of the larger of benefit obligations or plan assets the corridor  and amortizes amounts inside the corridor over the average remaining service life of active participants approximately years 
this method accelerates the recognition into income of events that have occurred and  therefore  may increase the sensitivity of the company s results of operations to external market volatility 
in  the company recognized net of tax income of  or per share per diluted share for the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
net income for totaled  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share per diluted share 
excluding the special charges and other merger related items  discontinued operations and extraordinary loss  net of tax  and the cumulative effect of an accounting change  income of was lower than income of  primarily due to higher depreciation and interest charges partially offset by a richer product mix and lower income tax provision 
outlook the company expects shipments to be approximately  tons  in spite of softening demand in the automotive and appliance markets 
value added products are expected to remain above of total shipments for the year 
however  pricing under long term contracts is expected to be lower across all steel product lines and spot market pricing is expected to remain significantly depressed through at least the first quarter 
steel scrap and slab prices are expected to be lower in than in  potentially reducing costs in the year 
while the prices paid for a portion of the company s natural gas purchases have been set  these costs are expected to be at least higher than in in addition  the company expects to undertake two outages for blast furnace maintenance in  costing approximately each 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  net of used to support letters of credit  the company had of availability under its accounts receivable purchase credit facility 
during  cash flow from operations generated  attributed primarily to of income excluding noncash charges for depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  offset by the impact of working capital items and a improvement in the funded status of the company s pension plans 
working capital cash usage included for inventories  primarily due to increases in stainless steel required by the rockport works  growth of hold for release inventory for contract sales  and higher than targeted slab inventories 
in addition  a cash usage in current liabilities was partially due to a reduction in incentive accruals 
cash flows used in investing totaled capital investments totaled  including in capitalized interest 
in addition  the company used for the purchase of long term investments 
cash flows from financing activities resulted in a net use of  including for dividends on common and preferred stock and for the purchase of common and preferred stock

forward looking statements certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this form k  or made in press releases or in oral presentations made by company employees  reflect management s estimates and beliefs and are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in particular  these include statements in the forgoing paragraphs entitled  raw materials  competition  environmental matters  legal proceedings  outlook  liquidity and capital resources  and new accounting standard 
in addition  these include statements in the paragraph entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the paragraphs entitled  fair value of financial instruments  new accounting standards  concentrations of credit risk  income taxes  commitments  and legal  environmental matters and contingencies 
the company cautions readers that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently expected by management 
in addition to those noted in the statements themselves  these factors include  but are not limited to  the following risks of a downturn in the general economy or in the domestic automotive industry  or continuing depressed conditions in the highly cyclical steel industry  volatility in financial markets  which may affect invested pension plan assets and the calculation of benefit plan liabilities and expenses  changes in demand for the company s products  including the possible need to shift shipments to the spot market from the contract market  unplanned plant outages  equipment failures or labor difficulties  actions by the company s foreign and domestic competitors  unexpected outcomes of major litigation and contingencies  changes in united states trade policy and actions with respect to imports  unanticipated increases in the prices for  or disruptions in the supply of  energy  particularly natural gas  and raw materials  adverse developments within the afsg insurance companies and resulting actions by insurance regulators  and changes in application or scope of environmental regulations applicable to the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company s market risk is limited to changes in a interest rates  b the prices of raw materials and energy sources  and c foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages interest rate risk by issuing substantially all fixed rate debt as a source of financing operations 
the fair value of this debt as of december  is  million 
a reduction in prevailing interest rates of would result in an increase in the total fair value of long term debt of approximately million 
the fair value was determined primarily from quoted prices 
the increase in total fair value due to an assumed decline in interest rates was calculated based on a change in the rate used to discount total future principal and interest payments 
an unfavorable effect on the company s results and cash flows from exposure to interest rate declines and a corresponding increase in the fair value of its debt would result only if the company elected to repurchase its debt at market prices 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in the price of certain commodities 
since to of steel sales are under long term contracts where the company may not be able to change its selling price in response to changes in the prices it pays for raw materials and energy  a rise in the price of natural gas or other commodities is for  the most part  absorbed by the company rather than passed on to the customer 
however  except in a small number of transactions where stainless steel prices assume a fixed nickel content value  nickel prices are recovered in price surcharges passed on to customers 
the company uses cash settled commodity futures contracts to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum  and zinc requirements 
the resulting gains and losses from the use of these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
based on the futures contracts outstanding at december   the following table presents the amount of a negative affect on pre tax income in millions of dollars of a hypothetical and decrease in the market price of each of the indicated commodities 
commodity derivative decrease decrease natural gas nickel aluminum zinc since these derivatives are structured as hedges  virtually all of the losses realized would be offset by the benefit of lower commodity prices 
the company does not enter into derivatives for trading purposes 
the company is also subject to risks of exchange rate fluctuations on receivables denominated in foreign currencies and forward currency contracts are used to manage exposures to certain of these currency price fluctuations 
the company has outstanding  at december   forward currency contracts with a total nominal value of million for the sale of euros 
based on the contracts outstanding at the end of  a increase in the euro to dollar rate would result in a million loss in value  which would offset the income generated by translation of the receivables collected
