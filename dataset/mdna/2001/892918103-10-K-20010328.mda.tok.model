foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s future results of operations or cash flow
