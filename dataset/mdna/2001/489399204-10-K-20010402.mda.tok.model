in  the company had substantially used up the net operating loss carryforward  which resulted in a significantly higher tax liability in liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources requirements include expenditures for real estate held for sale  distressed notes pools  joint venture fund investments and working capital needs 
historically  we have not required significant capital resources to support our brokerage and property management operations 
we finance our operations with internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit 
our investments in real estate are typically financed by mortgage loans secured primarily by that real estate 
these mortgage loans are generally nonrecourse in that  in the event of default  recourse will be limited to the mortgaged property serving as collateral

to the extent that we engage in additional strategic investments  including real estate  note portfolio  or acquisitions of other property management companies  we may need to obtain third party financing which could include bank financing or the public sale or private placement of debt or equity securities 
we believe that existing cash  plus capital generated from property management and leasing  brokerage  sales of real estate owned  collections from notes receivable  as well as our current lines of credit with east west bank and tokai bank of california  will provide us with sufficient capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our need  if any  to raise additional funds to meet our working capital and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success and pace of the implementation of our strategy for growth 
we regularly monitor capital raising alternatives to be able to take advantage of other available avenues to support our working capital and investment needs  including strategic partnerships and other alliances  bank borrowings  and the sale of equity or debt securities 
we intend to retain earnings to finance our growth and  therefore  do not anticipate paying dividends 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its results from operations 
such provisions include escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the respective agreements 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases and management agreements are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents and fees at market rates if they are below then existing market rates 
many of our leases require the tenants to pay a pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
