no assurance can be given that the actual future results will not differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we intend to continue focusing on increasing revenues and improving net income by developing our significant land holding and by expanding our real estate development activities 
we are currently working to take advantage of existing resources and market conditions as well as to anticipate and create future market trends and demand 
part of this effort includes evaluating our land and water resources to ensure that the resources essential for growing the core businesses are available when and where needed 
in the future  we will continue to assess the feasibility of entering into complementary new related lines of business and refining or reconfiguring current core businesses to take advantage of opportunities presented and changing market conditions 
results of operations as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  there was a net loss of  in and net income was  in and  in net income for declined when compared to due primarily to reduced operating profits from farming  increased real estate expenses and higher interest expenses 
net income for declined when compared to due primarily to lower farming revenues and increased real estate expenses 
real estate 
real estate segment profit of  in is  less than segment profit 
the decline in segment profit is due to increased revenues being more than offset by higher real estate expenses 
revenues grew  when compared to this growth is due to higher oil and mineral revenues of  the sale of land to ikea for  an increase in revenues from enron of  settlement of an easement transaction for  and an improvement in leasing revenues 
these revenue improvements were partially offset by revenues in of  related to the sale of a fiber optic communications easement 
real estate expenses increased  during when compared to the increase in expenses are due to higher professional service fees of  an increase in fixed water costs of  and commissions and cost of sales totaling  related to the ikea land sale 
these costs were partially offset by a  improvement in our share of the net loss at the petro travel plaza joint venture 
the increase in professional service fees continue to be related to our increased real estate development and entitlement activities 
the loss at the petro travel plaza joint venture declined during due to higher fuel sales  increased volume at its convenience store  and higher restaurant revenues 
these improvements  however  could not offset the higher cost of sales during the year due to the significant increase in oil and gas prices 
even though a loss was shown for the year  cash flows continued to improve and expectations are for continued growth in the future as more travelers and trucking professionals place petro on their refueling schedules 
in future years  as in  the real estate division will continue to see an increase in costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  planning costs  entitlement costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
these types of real estate development activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land  outside of tejon industrial complex as in  are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial  industrial  and residential programs 
real estate segment profits of  in were  less than segment profits 
this decrease in segment profits during was due to increases in staffing costs of  professional service fees of  increased depreciation costs of  and our share of losses related to the start up  training  opening  and first year operations of the petro travel plaza joint venture of  partially offsetting these increases in costs  were higher revenues during when compared to during  the qwest easement sale proceeds of  payments from enron of  related to land use and real estate services  a net increase in leasing income of  a  improvement in oil and mineral income  and improved communications revenues were more than offset by the sale of land in for a gain of  the increases in staffing costs and professional service fees are directly related to the increased real estate development activities of the company 
the increase in depreciation is primarily related to the purchase of four commercial office buildings during  which were purchased through a like kind property exchange to defer taxes on gains from the sale of land in and the qwest easement sale in see part i  item business commercial and land use for a further discussion of and future planning activities 
livestock 
livestock segment profits of  in are an increase of  when compared to segment profits 
the improvement in segment profits is primarily due to an increase in cattle sales of  and increased feedlot revenue of  cattle sales grew due to  additional head of cattle being sold at higher average prices than in feedlot revenues increased due to an increase in the average occupancy rate of outside customers during these improvements in revenues are partially offset by higher cost of sales on cattle sold of approximately  due to more cattle being sold and increases in feed cost of approximately  at the feedlot and year end drought conditions on the ranch 
in order to provide additional working capital for our real estate development activities  we are exploring the sale of our livestock assets 
on december  we sold a portion of our cattle assets to echeverria cattle company  llc  which is owned by matthew j 
echeverria  our former senior vice president  livestock and ranch operations 
the transaction involved the sale of approximately  cows  bulls and certain personal property for a purchase price of  as well as a grazing lease over approximately  acres of our land 
the lease has a term of ten years with two five year options to extend the term and would provide for rent at the rate of  per year  subject to adjustment based upon the extent to which we exercise our right to use portions of the land for other purposes 
the rent would also be subject to adjustment for the two five year extension periods based upon changes in the price of calves between the date the lease commences and the date any such extension term commences 
the sale involved approximately of our breeding herd and approximately of the total amount of our cattle 
mr 
echeverria continues to render services to the company on a part time basis 
in a separate transaction we have also sold an additional  head of stocker cattle to mr 
echeverria in the normal course of our sales of stocker cattle 
at december  the livestock division accounted for approximately million in book value of our identifiable assets representing approximately of the book value of our total assets 
the book value of the livestock division assets is not necessarily indicative of their fair market value 
for the fiscal years ended december    and  the livestock division accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
the completed sale and any possible future sales may include substantially all the assets of the livestock division 
while the sale of livestock assets would likely provide significant working capital  it would also result in a loss of significant revenues and income even after taking into account the revenue stream from the grazing leases that we expect to enter into in connection with the sales 
we continued to use the futures and options markets to protect the future selling prices of cattle and purchase prices of feed throughout during  due to the increase in future cattle prices related to anticipated sales in  we recognized approximately  in losses on closed hedge positions 
these losses on closed hedge positions are anticipated to be partially offset in as cattle are sold at higher prices 
our goal in managing cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allow us to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
the risk in managing cattle prices is that in those years that prices increase the hedge may limit or cap potential gains from the increase in price  and the risk in managing feed costs is that it can add additional costs for feed if grain prices fall dramatically 
cattle prices strengthened during when compared to due primarily to increases in demand for beef products and the anticipation of lower future supplies of cattle 
this improvement in cattle prices stalled during the fourth quarter of but began again for as inventory levels have declined 
we believe that overall for  cattle prices should continue to improve due to demand for product and lower inventories of cattle 
at this time the us cattle market has not been impacted significantly by widespread publicity regarding mad cow disease or foot and mouth disease 
as we sell our cattle during  we do not believe this concern will affect the prices we receive or the cattle market in general 
livestock operating profits of  in increased  when compared to operating profits 
this increase in operating profits was primarily due to an increase in cattle sales revenues and the continuing profits of our feedlot operations 
cattle sales revenues increased approximately million during due to  additional head of cattle being sold during this increase in cattle sold is the result of the growth in the cattle herd over the last three years 
our cattle herd at the end of was approximately  head compared to approximately  at the end of this increase in cattle sales revenues was partially offset by an increase in costs of sales on cattle sold of approximately million due to the increase in cattle sold 
the increase in combined livestock and feedlot revenues of million is due to the increase in cattle sales described above partially offset by a decrease in revenues of million at our feedlot in texas 
this significant reduction in feedlot revenues is primarily attributable to the fact that we elected to have a substantial number of our own cattle fed at the feedlot during  which resulted in a significant portion of the feedlot s revenues  when compared to  being eliminated as an intercompany transaction 
feedlot operations were also impacted  but to a lesser degree  by lower outside customer occupancy levels during the summer months and by lower prices charged to outside customers 
the decrease in revenues at the feedlot was more than offset by lower costs of sales due to lower prices for feed ingredients such as corn and milo when compared to the prior year 
overall for  our feedlot produced million in net operating profits  which is comparable to the prior year 
see part i  item business livestock operations for a further discussion of the company s livestock operations for and future expectations 
farming 
segment profits within the farming division during were  a decrease of  when compared to segment profits 
the decrease in segment profits is due primarily to lower grape revenues of  lower walnut revenues of  and higher cultural costs of  these unfavorable variances were partially offset by the net profits from the almond processing plant of  increased almond revenues of  higher pistachio revenues of  and lower fixed water costs of  the decrease in grape revenues is due to receiving lower prices for grapes than in prices for our grapes declined approximately during when compared to this decline in prices is due to increased grape production throughout california 
this growth in production could continue to impact grape prices for the next three to four years 
improved prices will be realized only if there is increased demand for wine and grape products and or there is a significant reduction in the number of acres used for grape production in california 
was the final year of a multi year purchase contract for our grape production 
we have been in discussions with several wineries regarding production contracts for and future years  but due to the pricing pressure on grapes  the wineries are currently not interested in a contract for our grapes 
if we have no grape contracts for  we will market our grapes to various wineries and the prices received will be driven by the wineries expectations regarding demand for their products and grape production 
during our discussions with the wineries we have learned that there is little interest in purchasing the cabernet grapes that we currently grow 
based on this information  we have begun the process of removing acres of fully depreciated cabernet grape acreage in order to save the cultural costs associated with growing the grapes 
almond revenues in increased due to a increase in prices resulting from lower crop production within california 
pistachio revenues were higher due to an increase in production as prices remained comparable to the prior year 
walnut revenues declined due to a decrease in production and the reversal of revenue associated with the crop because estimated prices for were less than we were actually paid 
farming segment profits included results from our almond processing plant that we purchased in january this plant processes  hulls  and shells almonds for ourselves and outside customers 
our almond s processed by the plant have been sold to third parties 
cultural costs grew during when compared to due to new acreage coming into production  costs no longer being capitalized and to fewer costs being inventoried that are related to the crop year 
industry expectations are that statewide nut crop yields should continue to improve  which may negatively impact prices 
we continue to expect pricing pressure on our almonds over the next couple of years due to new statewide plantings beginning to produce higher volumes of almonds 
this increase in production will positively impact our almond processing operation because of more almonds being available to process 
all of our crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
for a further discussion of the farming year refer to part i  item i business farming operations 
farming segment profits of  in were  less than segment profits 
the decrease in segment profits was primarily due to reduced almond revenues of  and reduced revenues from pistachios of  these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased walnut revenues of  and lower cultural costs of  the decrease in almond revenues during was due primarily to lower sales prices for almonds during the price of almonds declined approximately during when compared to the decline in prices was due to a record statewide crop for almonds 
during our production increased nearly million pounds when compared to due to improved weather conditions and to an increase in production from young almond orchards 
the significant increase in almond production across the state of california led the almond board of california to request an almond marketing reserve that was approved by the secretary of agriculture for approximately of the state s almond crop 
this means that only of our almond crop could be sold until the almond marketing order was lifted 
during the summer of the marketing order was lifted and our remaining almond crop was sold 
the combination of lower prices  which also impacted payments received in related to the almond crop  and the impact of the almond marketing order resulted in almond revenues declining as shown above 
the decline in pistachio revenues during was due to a fall in production because of the alternate bearing cycle of pistachios 
the increase in walnut revenues was due to an increase in production that was partially offset by a per pound reduction in walnut prices 
there was no significant variance in revenues related to grapes during as compared to due to production and pricing levels remaining constant between the years 
interest 
interest income for was  or  less than interest income 
income remained stable due to the average funds being invested remaining fairly flat when compared to interest income declined to  during from  in due primarily to a  reduction in average funds invested 
invested funds continued to decline during due to the growth of the cattle herd  capital expenditures  payment of dividends  and the financing of higher inventory balances 
interest expense during was  compared to  during this growth in interest expense was due to an increase in borrowings related to livestock operations and real estate entitlement and infrastructure costs 
total interest incurred and paid in was  compared to  in of which  and  was capitalized  respectively 
interest incurred and expensed continued to grow during due to increased borrowing used to fund the growth of livestock operations  infrastructure development costs  the purchase of an almond processing plant  and real estate planning and entitlement activities 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of short term and long term debt 
interest expense during was  a decrease of  when compared to interest expense 
the decrease in interest cost was due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased real estate infrastructure costs 
total interest paid including capitalized interest in was  which was an increase of  over total interest increased due to the funding of the growth in the cattle herd  infrastructure development and costs related to the development of the tejon industrial complex  an increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of commercial buildings  and the real estate planning and entitlement activities 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses during were  a decline of  when compared to corporate expenses 
when compared to  reductions in insurance  director s fees and shareholder expenses were partially offset by increased staffing costs 
staffing costs increased primarily due to deferred stock compensation and to management information systems mis personnel being hired for all of compared to a partial year in corporate expenses for were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase during was due to higher staffing costs  increased director and shareholder expense  and to increases in donations 
the increase in staffing costs  was due to increases in the accounting and mis departments  increased incentive compensation accruals  and increases in retirement plan costs 
higher director and shareholder expense  was primarily due to costs associated with the transfer of the trading of our stock from the american stock exchange to the new york stock exchange 
donations increased approximately  primarily due to us committing to donate funds to help a local university build a new building for its business school 
inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on our operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
impact of accounting change 
effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas standardizes accounting for all derivative contracts and requires that all derivative contracts be reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives meeting certain specific requirements can be designated as hedges and the special accounting rules of sfas applied 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december  and  we recognized losses of  and  related to sfas and recognized  in gains during related to sfas these amounts are included in livestock cost of sales 
management has elected to not designate its futures and option contracts as hedges 
accordingly  for we reported a gain of  net of tax of  resulting from the cumulative effect of the change required by sfas in the consolidated statements of operations 
financial condition 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   an increase of  from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is  greater than working capital at the end of we have a revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of  bearing interest at a rate which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
at our option the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed for a period of time at over a selected libor rate or float at 
less than the bank s prime lending rate 
our feedlot also has a short term revolving line of credit for the feedlot with a local bank for  with an outstanding balance at december  of  bearing interest at a rate of  which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
the revolving line of credit at the feedlot is used as a short term cash management tool and for the financing of cattle and feed receivables at the feedlot 
overall  the use of short term credit has grown due to increases in inventories as a result of the growth of our business lines and of the funding of infrastructure construction costs on a short term basis 
our outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  increased  to  at the end of when compared to long term debt is being used to fund real estate development infrastructure and farming assets on our land  commercial buildings in phoenix  arizona that were purchased in  our feedlot in texas  and the almond processing plant purchased in january the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents during   and consisted of capital expenditures  expansion of the cattle herd  purchase of land  purchases of commercial buildings  purchase of an almond processing plant  payments of long term debt  the payment of dividends and the financing of higher receivables and inventories 
the accurate forecasting of cash flows is made difficult due to the fact that commodity markets set the prices for the majority of our products and the fact that the cost of water changes significantly from year to year as a result of changes in its availability 
based on our past experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures  which includes nearly  for infrastructure at the tejon industrial complex and  for real estate projects in los angeles county and the mountain lake area of our land 
other items included in the capital expenditure budget are equipment  improvements to existing facilities  and a potential new pistachio planting 
one of the sources of funding for the above capital expenditures and ongoing operations during will be the proceeds of the million rights offering that was completed on january  proceeds from this offering were designated to be used to further develop the tejon industrial complex and for costs related to constraints and feasibility analyses  early phase and detailed planning  and preparing applications for entitlements in the mountain lake area of our land 
additional funds for capital expenditures and operations are expected to come from lines of credit with banks  reimbursement of infrastructure costs related to the tejon industrial complex through bond proceeds from a local government agency  and from operating cash flows 
we continue to expect that substantial investments will need to be made in future years  in our land assets to secure entitlements and develop the land 
in order to fund this growth  we expect to use various financing alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  increases in lines of credit with banks  sales of assets  and the issuance of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to its own outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields while prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years with an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poors 
see note  marketable securities  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short term working capital line of credit and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the short term line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
a portion of the long term debt  has a fixed interest rate  and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the remaining long term debt  can either be fixed for periods of time to a libor rate or float with the lending bank s prime rate 
the floating rate obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense also decreases 
we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
it is our objective to hedge between and of its variable rate interest payments 
to meet this objective we entered into an interest rate swap to manage the potential fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
see note notes to consolidated financial statements 
credit and market risks related to our inventories and receivables ultimately depends on the value of the cattle  almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure

commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories  gross margins  accounts receivable  and certain anticipated transactions in our livestock and farming divisions 
commodities such as corn and cattle are purchased and sold at market prices that are subject to volatility 
in order to manage the risk of market price fluctuations  we enter into various exchange traded futures and option contracts 
we closely monitor and manage our exposure to market price risk on a daily basis in accordance with formal policies established for this activity 
these policies limit the duration to maturity of contracts entered into as well as the level of exposure to be hedged 
our goal in managing our cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allow us to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
see note  commodity contracts used to manage risk  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a futures contract is an obligation to make or take delivery at a specific future time of a specifically defined  standardized unit of a commodity at a price determined when the contract is executed 
options are contracts that give their owners the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell a specified item at a set price on or before a specified date 
losses on futures contracts and options as of december  were  as compared to the approximately  in losses at december  the increase in hedge losses is primarily due to an increase in cattle prices during  and an increase in prices related to the future delivery of cattle  which caused futures contracts and options to be repriced  creating losses on the derivative positions 
these losses are expected to be offset by the increase in prices received on the sale of cattle 
inventories consist primarily of cattle for sale  and price fluctuations are managed with futures and options contracts 
see the table below for contracts outstanding at year end 
we are at risk with respect to changes in market prices with respect to cattle held for sale that are not protected by futures and options contracts 
at december  approximately of the cattle held in inventory or  head of cattle were not protected by futures and options for price movement 
this compares to  head of cattle at december  the number of head of cattle equates to approximately million pounds of beef 
for each 
per pound change in price  we have a potential exposure of  in future value 
although the price which the cattle will ultimately be sold is unknown  over the last three years the market price has ranged from 
per pound to 
per pound and the current market price at march  was 
per pound

these receivables are recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known until the third or fourth quarter of the following year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december   only  is at risk to changing prices 
of the amount at risk to changing prices   is attributable to almonds   to pistachios   to walnuts  and  to grapes 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  related to almonds and  related to pistachios   to walnuts  and  to grapes 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every 
change in the price of almonds our receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years the final prices have ranged from

the price estimated for recording accounts receivable for walnuts was 
per pound 
for every 
change in the price of walnuts  our receivable increases or decreases by  the final price for walnuts has averaged from 
to 
over the last three years 
the prices used to estimate accounts receivable related to grapes is based on the variety of wine grape and the market for that grape 
at year end the average price used for recording the accounts receivable was per ton 
for every change in the price  our receivables related to grapes can increase or decrease approximately  the average price for grapes has averaged between per ton to per ton over the last three years
