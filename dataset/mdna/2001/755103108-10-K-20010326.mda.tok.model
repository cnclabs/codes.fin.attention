the company s operations are categorized into three business segments wet friction  dry friction and aftermarket 
additional information on these business segments is presented in note k segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared with the most significant event that occurred in the year for raytech corporation was the confirmation by the bankruptcy court of raytech s second amended plan of reorganization plan  which confirmation was affirmed by the us district court on september  the plan and the confirmation process are discussed more fully in note a to the consolidated financial statements herein 
during fiscal  the company recorded certain charges and related liabilities as liabilities subject to compromise in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
the charges and related liabilities discussed above included an estimate of the asbestos related personal injury liability of billion and an estimate of the government s claim for certain environmental liabilities of million 
as part of the bankruptcy proceedings with respect to successor liability  raytech has recorded a charge of million to reflect its liability for funding the raymark pension plan as well as a charge for million for certain other raymark retiree liabilities 
when the plan becomes effective  substantially all the liabilities subject to compromise will be discharged in exchange for of stock of reorganized raytech  while the current equity holders will retain a ownership position 
the bankruptcy court has not yet determined if the pension and retiree claims will be discharged as part of the exchange for of stock of reorganized raytech or whether they will be addressed as a priority claim  which would require raytech to fund the liabilities out of current operations 
there are several conditions and other matters that must be resolved in order to have the plan become effective 
accordingly  it is difficult to predict with certainty when it will become effective 
raytech corporation s revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in net loss for the year ended december  was billion or  basic loss per share  as compared to net income of million or basic earnings per share in net sales worldwide net sales were million  compared with million in  a reduction of million or 
the wet friction segment sales decreased million primarily due to weak sales in the light duty component of the wet friction segment 
the decline in sales volume was partially due to the much anticipated slowing in the us economy and the loss of certain sales to a major customer due to foreign competition 
the impact on the automotive original equipment manufacturers has resulted in slow movement of inventory 
however  decreases were partially offset by improvements in the heavy duty and agricultural markets as the demand for certain items increased 
aftermarket sales decreased million compared with the prior year as a result of aggressive inventory management at certain of our customers 
in general  the aftermarket was slower in as compared to the dry friction segment sales decreased million year over year due to an adverse foreign currency fluctuation million  offset by an increase in sales of million 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales for the period ended december  is as compared to for the same period one year ago 
the improved gross profit of 
percentage points was due primarily to the improved performance at the sterling heights  michigan  manufacturing facility 
during the fiscal year  management changes and related cost savings programs at this facility provided for the improved performance 
manufacturing costs were further controlled through reductions in the number of employees during the year  as well as benefits derived through improved efficiencies from capital investment 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased 
to million as compared to one year earlier 
the cost decrease is attributable to reduced administrative staff and reductions in selling costs 
interest expense interest expense  excluding the raymark note  is down slightly as compared to the prior year 
during  raybestos products company and raytech automotive components company terminated their loan and security agreements with bank of america and entered into a new loan and security agreement agreement with congress financial corporation 
the new agreement provides for raybestos products company  raytech automotive components company and automotive composites company to borrow up to million in the aggregate 
the agreement consists of a million revolving line of credit and a term loan of million 
the revolving line of credit is limited through a formula which provides availability based on qualified accounts receivable and inventory 
the debt refinancing lowered the interest rate basis points on all domestic borrowing 
additionally  lower capital expenditures year over year provided funds to lower the overall debt position of the company 
in connection with the january bankruptcy court decision to require raytech to halt payments on its promissory note payable to raymark  management has concluded that interest should not be accrued during the cease payment period 
accordingly  no interest has been accrued in fiscal  and the ultimate resolution of interest to be paid on the note is subject to the uncertainties inherent in reorganization proceedings under the bankruptcy code 
other income  net other income  net consists of miscellaneous items of which the most significant is interest income in the amount of thousand 
income taxes in  the company recorded an additional deferred tax asset of billion relating to the tax effects of the liabilities subject to compromise 
based on its historical taxable income  the company expects to realize approximately million of the total deferred tax asset through the ten year carryback of the previously paid taxes and the expected tax benefits during the twenty year carryforward period 
accordingly  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of billion against the gross deferred tax asset to state it at its expected net realizable value 
when the plan becomes effective  and the liabilities subject to compromise are settled for less than the recorded amount of allowed claims  the net deferred tax asset will be adjusted accordingly 
the company s effective tax rate  excluding the deferred tax benefit referred to above  for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the prior year 
the company s effective tax rate of differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign taxes 
in the prior periods  the tax rate was reduced by the effect of certain legal and other costs deducted for tax purposes but offset for financial reporting purposes against the principal balance of the raymark note payable in connection with an indemnification agreement with raymark see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the offset against the principal balance of the raymark note has been substantially utilized and this tax benefit is no longer available 
this issue accounts for substantially all of the increase in the effective tax rate 
the company has in process an internal revenue service tax audit for the through fiscal years 
the irs has proposed disallowance of million of bankruptcy related costs relating to through  which are included in the indemnification agreement with raymark 
the company has deducted approximately million of such costs through december  and continues to believe these costs are deductible 
the ultimate resolution of the company s liability  if any  is dependent on the interpretation of a complex set of facts and applicable legal precedents 
while the company and its advisors believe the company s position is supported by the facts and the weight of the legal precedents  it is reasonably possible  through a different factual analysis and application of countervailing legal authority  that a final determination could be adverse to the company 
as such  the company intends to contest the proposed disallowance and has not recorded any related provisions 
should the irs ultimately prevail in its claim  an adjustment related to prior year tax accruals would be required

operating profit is income before income taxes and minority interest 
net sales by business segment wet friction aftermarket dry friction wet friction segment in millions net sales operating profit wet friction segment revenues decreased percent to million as compared with million in the decline was the result of slowing demand in the light duty original equipment market  which includes automotive original equipment and light duty or highway original equipment 
new products totaling million were introduced through the automotive original equipment section of the wet friction segment 
the increases were offset by slower demand in the fourth quarter of as the automobile manufacturers reduced orders for our products 
additionally  the loss to foreign competitors of certain parts to one of our customers further reduced sales 
the heavy duty market showed improvement over as demand for certain agricultural products increased 
the agricultural market increased approximately million as compared to operating profit was equal to the prior year at million 
the ability to retain the operating profits at the same level as with million less in sales is due primarily to improved profitability at the michigan manufacturing facility and other cost containment programs throughout the company

market conditions and outlook the company s wet friction segment expects to continue to face an increasingly competitive automotive environment and a continued slowdown for the demand in certain agricultural machine products 
our major customers in the automotive industry face an increased competitive automotive environment which is likely to continue to limit raytech s pricing flexibility in the near term 
in addition  the weakness of the japanese yen and other asian currencies against the us dollar and the uncertain future of the asian economies could result in substantial increases in imports from asia to the us and canada 
the asian economic difficulties could have an unfavorable effect on overall economic conditions in the us and canada  where our major customers sales are concentrated 
with regard to the company s agricultural equipment operations  worldwide farm commodity prices remain low as a result of prospects for increased global supplies of grains and oilseeds  as well as fears about the asian economic issues 
accordingly  retail demand for agricultural equipment in is now projected to remain at levels in north america  europe  latin america and australia 
in light of this outlook and the company s continuing commitment to aggressive asset management  production schedules are being reviewed for to ensure the company s production meets demand 
the aftermarket segment is expected to remain constant compared to results for the competition in this market continues to increase as mergers continue to occur between suppliers 
the sales in this segment have been driven by new product introductions in filters  dry friction clutch facings and planetary gears over the past years 
introducing new products for this market is a key element in the strategy 
the dry friction segment continues to operate in a sluggish european environment with unemployment remaining at high levels and economic growth improving only marginally 
the development of new market opportunities in asia is supported through the new production facility in china 
this facility improved sales substantially over  growing from million in sales to million in  an increase of 
million 
the overall asian economy continues to be negatively affected by the weakened economies of japan and other asian countries 
therefore  growth in will be at a slower pace compared to the company s outlook for anticipates modest reduction in sales with lower operating income compared to results 
maintaining market share in the automotive original equipment market and the continued introduction of new products for aftermarket distribution are expected to be the drivers for performance 
further  it is anticipated that the dry friction operation in china will improve the performance of this segment 
euro conversion the company is well advanced in the process of identification  implementation and testing of its systems to adopt the euro currency in its operations affected by this change 
the company s affected suppliers  distribution network and financial institutions have been contacted and the company does not believe the currency change will significantly impact these relationships

the amount of exposure which could be created by increases in rates is not considered significant by management 
the local currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries have been designated as the functional currencies 
accordingly  financial statements of foreign operations are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities  historical exchange rates for elements of stockholders equity and an average exchange rate in effect during the year for revenues and expenses 
where possible  the company attempts to mitigate foreign currency translation effects by borrowing in local currencies to fund operations 
the company does not believe that the fluctuation in foreign currency will have a material adverse effect on the company s overall financial condition
