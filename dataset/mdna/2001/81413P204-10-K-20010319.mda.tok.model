the results of operations for these segments  are discussed below 
these two sections are followed by a discussion of security capital s liquidity and capital resources 
all three of these sections should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
results of operations capital division earnings from security capital are primarily generated by its strategic investments 
the majority of these investments are not consolidated and security capital reports its share of their respective earnings 
the consolidated investments during included homestead which is the largest consolidated investment  belmont and european real estate shares 
beginning in  security capital will consolidate additional investees due to the acquisition of sc us realty s assets described below 
cash flow for the capital division is generated through receipt of dividends and interest payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail of dividends received 
results for were significantly impacted by changes in the equity in earnings from strategic investees and the levels of investment in strategic investees 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees the equity in earnings of security capital s unconsolidated investees included changes in unrealized gains or losses for sc us realty and sc preferred growth 
these changes were generated as a result of fluctuating market prices for the shares in their underlying investments and were reflected in earnings due to sc us realty s and sc preferred growth s use of fair value accounting 
fluctuations in market prices do not have an impact on cash flow  but the general increase in real estate equity security prices in and general decline in and had a material impact on security capital s equity in earnings of sc us realty  and therefore on security capital s earnings 
subsequent to january   security capital will no longer experience the earnings volatility associated with sc us realty due to the acquisition of that company s assets by security capital and the discontinued use of fair value accounting 
presented below is security capital s equity in earnings loss for the years ended december    and dollar amounts in millions and security capital s common share ownership interest in unconsolidated affiliates as of december    and explanations of earnings changes at the investee level which materially impacted security capital s equity in earnings follow the table 
equity in earnings loss year ended ownership as of december  december  archstone prologis sc european realty sc preferred growth sc us sc us sc us real estate shares strategic hotel archstone archstone s increase in earnings for compared to was due primarily to an increase in rental rates and improvement in operating margins 
security capital s ownership position in archstone decreased from as of december  to as of december  as a result of security capital selling portions of its archstone stock in three separate stock sales transactions 
accordingly  security capital group s equity in earnings for archstone also decreased during on february   security capital sold substantially all of its remaining shares of archstone stock in an underwritten public offering and a sale of shares back to archstone 
proceeds of the sale were used to pay off debt 
atlantic was merged into archstone in july for purposes of this table  the results of archstone and atlantic are combined for the year ended december  prologis increases in prologis earnings were a result of further expansion of services provided through its corporate distribution facilities business  which consists of the development of distribution facilities for sales or fees 
income for this business segment increased by more than in  but growing or sustaining this level of sales cannot be assured 
prologis operating properties also provided solid performance 
this increase was partially offset by results in prologis refrigerated logistics business which declined from prologis also recognized million of transactional gains from completing million in asset optimization dispositions during in march  prologis merged with meridian industrial trust 
the shares issued by prologis to complete the merger reduced security capital s ownership position from at year end to at year end security capital continues to be prologis largest shareholder 
prologis increase in earnings for over was primarily due to an increase in income generated by prologis unconsolidated subsidiaries which provide temperature controlled storage and build to suit services and a increase in the square footage of distribution facilities owned primarily due to the meridian merger 
sc european realty sc european realty earnings included gains on sale of development redevelopment assets from the office business sector during additionally  its subsidiary  interparking  experienced strong same store sales growth and performance of acquired businesses in sc european realty commenced operations in april therefore  the primary reason for its improved results in compared to was a full year of operations in security capital s weighted average investment increased to million in from million in sc european realty s current investments are primarily in operating and development companies with pre stabilized assets at december  it is expected that recurring earnings for sc european realty will continue to increase as additional properties reach stabilization 
however  there will be variability in sc european realty s earnings since a portion of earnings are derived from asset sales  and earnings may decrease in some years 
sc european realty will focus on three core businesses self storage  suburban office and parking 
sc preferred growth sc preferred growth s change in earnings for the years ended   and was due primarily to changes in market prices for the shares in its underlying investments and increases in sc preferred growth s weighted average net assets at fair value 
the market value of sc preferred growth s investments increased by million in  declined by million in  and declined million in sc preferred growth s weighted average net assets at fair value were billion in  million in  and million in sc us realty sc us realty s net income in was due primarily to an increase in market prices for the shares of its underlying investments  partially offset when one investee experienced realized losses on sales of a portion of its real estate investments 
sc us realty also sold its investments in security capital common stock and convertible debentures for a loss of million in march because of security capital s ownership position in sc us realty  security capital recorded its pro rata portion of the loss on the sale of common stock as a reduction of additional paid in capital and its pro rata portion of the loss on the convertible debentures as a discount to convertible debentures 
sc us realty experienced losses for the years ended and primarily from the overall decrease in market prices for the shares in its underlying investments 
the portfolio of strategic long term investments experienced a million market value decline in which included a million loss on the sale of its special opportunity investment portfolio  and a million market value decline in net investment income defined as dividends and other investment income net of administrative expenses  advisor fees  taxes and interest was million  million  and million for the years ended   and respectively 
the increase in net investment income during compared to is due to decreased interest expense on its line of credit 
the decline in net investment income during compared to is primarily related to decreased dividend income from the special opportunity investment portfolio due to the sale of this portfolio throughout during  security capital s ownership position in sc us realty increased from to as sc us realty repurchased approximately of its outstanding shares 
security capital made an additional investment in sc us realty of million in on january   a security capital subsidiary purchased all assets of sc us realty for shares and cash  resulting in the net issuance of million class b shares and the payment of million in cash 
in addition  security capital funded million to repay indebtedness of sc us realty existing on the date of acquisition by borrowing million on a transaction loan 
the loan bore interest at libor and matured in one year 
in february  security capital fully repaid the loan with proceeds from the sales of archstone shares 
the purchase of sc us realty s assets gives security capital the ability to control or influence those investments directly and reduce expenses significantly 
offsetting these benefits is the loss of advisory fees million in and the issuance of million class b shares which will be partially offset by share repurchases 
see the pro forma financial statements at sc us realty acquisition and sale of archstone stock 
strategic hotel in september  security capital sold its entire ownership in strategic hotel for net proceeds of approximately million  generating a loss of million 
the sale proceeds were used to reduce security capital s line of credit balance and to fund share and debenture repurchases 
as a result of the sale  equity in earnings from strategic hotel were not recorded after the second quarter of consolidated investments homestead homestead s results were positively impacted as a result of accomplishing three primary objectives established in reduction of debt through land sales  reduction in operating costs  and improved property level operating margins 
the following table sets forth the results of homestead s operations in   and homestead total portfolio operating properties average occupancy average weekly rate weekly revpar property operating margin all amounts are annual averages except operating properties  which are as of year end 
management targets an operating margin of to but there are no assurances that such margins will be achieved 
overall property level results for homestead are summarized below for   and in millions total property revenue total property expense net operating income property level operating margins increased by basis points as weekly revenue per available room revpar increased by 
net income  before a million provision for loss on properties held for sale recorded in and a million special charge recorded in described below  increased by million from to net operating income increased over due to an increase in occupancy as well as the impact of restructuring operations in the increase in net operating income from to was due to an increase in the number of operating facilities as well as the restructuring of operations 
the increase in operating properties from to  was the primary reason for security capital s consolidated increase in depreciation from million in to million in during  homestead made a decision to end its development program for all projects that were in the planning stages 
a special charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of for primarily write downs of land held for sale  write offs of costs of pursuing other land parcels and the costs of severance of personnel 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the special charge 
as of the end of february  homestead had sold million of the original million of land held for sale 
in  operating properties were classified as held for sale and a provision for loss of million was recorded to reduce the properties carrying value to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  homestead sold of these properties at the reduced carrying value for proceeds of approximately million which were primarily used to reduce debt 
homestead s net operating income in future periods will be lower due to these sales but the remaining assets are newer 
homestead was not in operation during the last significant us economic slowdown 
if a recession or significant reduction in us economic growth occurs and persists  homestead property performance may suffer 
in aggregate  homestead properties were ahead of comparable results through february belmont belmont s activities involve the operation and development of assisted living facilities 
as of december   belmont had four operating communities  one of which was stabilized in construction is underway on five additional sites with three additional properties in the planning process 
belmont s net loss of million for the year ended december  was an improvement from s net loss of approximately million  due to non recurring start up expenses incurred in and positive net income from the first four communities in as they became operational 
as of february  belmont s operating properties had the following occupancies location opening date occupancy west university houston  tx december  green hills nashville  tn october  st

interest expense consolidated interest expense was million in  million in  and million in the decrease from to was due to the reduction of line of credit balances from operating cash flow and asset sales and the elimination of interest on the homestead convertible mortgages which were purchased from archstone in july the increase from to was due to an increase in average long term debt outstanding from million in to million in and higher interest expense at homestead as no interest was capitalized after the curtailment of development activity during the second quarter of preferred share dividends preferred share dividends for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in was due to a million non cash dividend incurred in in conjunction with the exchange of series a preferred shares and certain class b shares for series b preferred shares 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
financial services division the primary components of the financial services division are the capital markets group and the global capital management group 
these two groups were the financial services division s primary earnings generators 
in addition  the corporate services group and the real estate research group enable security capital and its affiliates to combine certain activities with affiliates and achieve economies of scale 
revenues for the financial services division are presented in the following table for the years ended december   and in millions revenues global capital management group corporate services group capital markets group real estate research group sub total less amounts eliminated in consolidation total during the latter half of  the global capital management group became increasingly successful in adding new investment management clients  which has continued throughout and resulted in higher revenues 
assets under management for the global capital management group as of december   and  are presented in the following table in millions sc european realty    sc preferred growth  sc us realty sc us    mutual funds other excludes investments in security capital held by sc us realty which were sold in the first quarter although real estate security prices rose in  the decline in real estate security prices in and made it more difficult to execute capital markets transactions in those years 
in addition  in there were fewer equity transactions among security capital s investees in which the capital markets group participated  thus impacting revenues for capital markets group 
in order to expand the base of potential clients for the capital markets group  security capital contributed this subsidiary s assets to macquarie capital partners llc 
security capital now owns of this entity  with macquarie bank of australia owning  and the entity s management owning the other 
no gain or loss was recognized on this contribution 
beginning in  security capital will recognize its share of macquarie capital partners llc s net earnings or losses 
other items general  administrative and other expenses general  administrative and other expenses for  and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the continued decreases from each year resulted primarily from personnel reductions and other cost controls by security capital and homestead 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate of on gaap pre tax income for was lower than the expected corporate tax rate of primarily due to use of capital and operating loss carry forwards at consolidated subsidiaries and non taxable earnings of a foreign subsidiary 
the effective income tax benefit was of loss from operations for  which is less than the us statutory tax rate of due to losses at consolidated subsidiaries which were not consolidated for tax purposes that can only be recognized when the subsidiary is sold or through taxable income generated by the subsidiary  and capital losses generated from the sale of strategic hotel were used to offset capital gains in the effective tax rate in was of the operating loss  which approximates the statutory tax rate 
security capital expects its future effective tax rate to be closer to the statutory rate because net operating loss carryforwards were substantially utilized in  which is expected to impact net earnings 
security capital s tax basis in investees is generally equal to its original cost basis for such assets  reduced by the portion of the cumulative dividends received from investees which may have been characterized for tax purposes as return of capital 
security capital s basis on which taxes would be calculated upon a sale of the investments in its strategic investees at december   was as follows in thousands archstone  prologis  sc european realty  sc us sc us  homestead  belmont  carramerica  city center retail  cws communities  urban growth  regency  storage usa  investments acquired from sc us realty on january  reflects security capital s basis as a result of that transaction 
extraordinary items in  there were extraordinary gains on early extinguishments of debt  totaling million 
during the second quarter  security capital exchanged with an unaffiliated party approximately million shares of archstone for million face value of convertible debentures  resulting in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax 
the second extraordinary gain  amounting to million  net of tax  related to the in substance extinguishment of the homestead convertible mortgages acquired by security capital as partial consideration for approximately million archstone shares sold to archstone 
in there were extraordinary gains on early extinguishments of debt  net of minority interest  totaling million 
the first  amounting to million  related to the repurchase of million principal amount of convertible debentures by security capital 
the second  amounting to million  related to full settlement of a finders fee liability by homestead 
the million extraordinary loss in on the early extinguishment of debt  net of minority interest  relates to the extinguishment of homestead mortgage notes with atlantic 
ebdadt earnings before depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  or ebdadt  is considered by management to be an additional measure of operating performance for security capital and its affiliates  supplementing net earnings as measured by gaap 
among other things  gaap net earnings includes the impact of real estate depreciation 
the value of the real estate assets generally changes in response to existing market conditions and does not necessarily diminish in value predictably over time  as historical cost depreciation implies 
therefore  consistent with real estate industry practice  ebdadt adjusts gaap net earnings by eliminating real estate related depreciation 
ebdadt also involves certain other adjustments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the most material being the omission of changes in unrealized gains and losses on real estate securities due to fluctuations in market prices 
ebdadt should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other gaap measurement of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or as a measure of security capital s liquidity 
capital division ebdadt reflects equity in ebdadt before special items from investees  less allocated general and administrative expenses  interest expense  taxes and non real estate related depreciation 
financial services division ebdadt reflects allocations of general and administrative expenses  taxes and non real estate related depreciation 
ebdadt results before special items for the years ended december    and were as follows in millions capital division financial services division ebdadt before special items ebdadt results for the financial services division for all years can be attributed to the same factors that impacted financial services division revenues and expenses  as discussed above 
due to changes in strategic focus see part  business and related re allocations of capital  the capital division also incurred the following special items for the years ended   and amounts in millions 
management does not believe these items relate to continuing operating performance 
realized gains losses extraordinary gain on retirement of debt  net of tax gain on sale of archstone stock  net of tax homestead s special charges related to land write downs  employee severance and other expenses related to curtailing its development program loss on sale of strategic hotel security capital s special charge related to overhead reductions sc us realty acquisition and sale of archstone stock as discussed in significant developments during  security capital completed the purchase of all of sc us realty s assets on january  and the sale of its remaining archstone shares on february  the following pro forma financial information has been prepared as if the transactions occurred on december  for balance sheet purposes and prior to january  for statement of operations purposes

the purchase price was computed as follows issuance of security capital class b shares  cash payments to sc us realty dissenting shareholders 
 cash payment to sc us realty for redemption of the convertible debentures  assumption of sc us realty s liabilities at estimated fair value  costs incurred by security capital  assumed purchase price  represents the value of  security capital class b shares that were exchanged for the  outstanding shares of sc us realty not owned by security capital and its subsidiaries or by shareholders who voted against the transaction and chose cash 
the value of the class b shares is based on the closing price of the class b shares for the three business days before the transaction was completed on january  per share 
the outstanding shares of sc us realty are calculated as follows sc us realty shares outstanding as of january  sc us  less sc us realty shares owned by security sc us  less sc us realty shares to be purchased for sc us  outstanding shares of sc us sc us  represents the cash payment to cash electing sc us realty shareholders of per share based upon the average of the high and low per share sales prices of class b shares during the fifteen day trading period ending on january   as defined in the transaction agreement

b represents the reduction in basis of sc us realty s noncurrent assets in accordance with the purchase method of accounting based on the purchase price see note a 
prior to its acquisition by security capital  sc us realty reported its assets using the fair value method of accounting 
therefore  the information reflected in sc us realty s historical column represents the values determined by sc us realty under fair value accounting consistent with its past practice 
because the acquisition by security capital is at a price that is less than such value of the assets  there is approximately  of negative goodwill  which must be allocated to the long lived assets acquired 
security capital group incorporated notes to unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements continued a summary of the recorded values of sc us realty s assets  the calculation of negative goodwill and the calculation of the adjustment for the reduction in basis of sc us realty s noncurrent assets are as follows recorded value of investments in operating companies  book value of sc us realty s other sc us  adjustment to recorded value of other assets see note c  less purchase price see note a  less existing security capital investment in sc us realty  less existing deferred tax liability on investment in sc us us  less capital loss carryforward generated in transaction  negative goodwill  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the negative goodwill is applied pro rata to sc us realty s long lived assets  which are its investments in operating companies

a net deferred tax asset of  is created based on the difference between the tax basis and carrying value of the assets purchased in the transaction 
because the realizability of the net deferred tax asset is uncertain  a valuation allowance has been established in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fully offsetting this asset 
f adjustment of sc us realty s shareholders equity based on the fair value of the shares to be received from security capital as calculated below  shares of class b shares at per share the per share value of the class b shares to be issued to us realty holders on a to one basis as described in note a  existing security capital investment in sc us sc us  cash paid to sc us realty cash electing sc us  transaction costs incurred by security capital  sc us realty s shareholders equity as of december  total adjustment  security capital group incorporated notes to unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements continued g the components of the acquisition to be financed are sc us realty convertible debentures  principal and interest  purchase price plus transaction costs  total financed  less transaction loan financing  net increase in lines of credit outstanding  h represents i the to one exchange of  shares of sc us realty shares for  shares of class b shares  ii the par value of shares issued at par value which results in  of additional paid in capital  iii the payment of  million to sc us realty s cash electing shareholders  and iv the elimination of the remainder of sc us realty s shareholders equity 
i subsequent to the acquisition  security capital intends to continue operating former sc us realty s assets as part of a real estate operating company 
as a result  security capital will not use fair value accounting as sc us realty did  but rather will continue to use historical cost accounting for those assets 
in addition  the former investments in real estate companies of sc us realty investments in real estate companies will now be consolidated where security capital can vote more than of the shares of an entity or reported utilizing the equity method of accounting where security capital does not have control  yet owns greater than 
thus  purchase accounting adjustments are required for sc us realty s consolidated subsidiaries city center retail trust  cws communities trust and urban growth properties trust  collectively the consolidated entities 
since the value of the consolidated entities assets exceeds security capital s new basis in them  negative goodwill is created which is then allocated to the consolidated entities long lived assets  namely their real estate

cash received in will increase because of dividends received from former sc us realty investees partially offset by the sale of archstone shares  the sale of homestead properties and the loss of advisory fees from sc us realty 
due to higher average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates  consolidated interest expense increased from million in to million in as discussed previously 
this increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in dividends received from prologis from to the net increase  along with reduced capital markets fees  was the primary cause for the decrease in consolidated cash from operations from million in to million in stock and debenture repurchase programs as of march   security capital had repurchased million shares of class b common stock equivalents for a purchase price of million comprised of thousand class a shares and million class b shares since august when the share repurchase program was announced

in the longer term  security capital intends to finance its business activities through the selective sale of assets  internally generated cash flow  its line of credit  and future issuance of equity and debt securities 
the business activities to be financed may include investments in new business initiatives  additional investments in certain existing affiliates and additional potential repurchases of security capital securities

security capital will finance the purchase with available cash and borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
risk factors the following matters may affect security capital s future financial performance 
reliance on dividends and earnings of investees most of security capital s cash flow and earnings comes from real estate operating companies in which it owns shares 
security capital is partially dependent on dividends and fees it receives from these companies to meet its operating expense needs and to pay principal and interest on its debt 
although security capital has influence over these real estate operating companies because of its significant ownership interest and contractual rights  it has a non majority ownership interest and the right to designate nominees for fewer than a majority of the board seats  and does not have unilateral control in several of these companies 
decisions or actions of investee management could adversely affect security capital 
conflicts of interest transactions with affiliates have occurred and may occur in the future 
several of security capital s directors or senior officers are directors or trustees of its affiliates  or own shares of its affiliates 
those persons may have conflicts of interest in affiliate transactions 
where security capital engages in these types of transactions it has or will obtain disinterested director approval or shareholder approval  when necessary  for transactions in which directors may have a conflict of interest 
neither security capital s charter nor its bylaws contain any restrictions on interested party transactions 
real estate risks security capital is subject to the following risks unique to the real estate business 
changes in specific economic conditions or commercial patterns that reduce demand for real estate for example  a recession or change in technology that reduces demand for real estate facilities or which results in bankruptcy of tenants 

changes in tax laws or market conditions that make real estate investment less attractive relative to other investment opportunities 
such changes would reduce the number of buyers for real estate and adversely affect real estate asset values 
selling real estate assets typically takes longer than selling other types of assets  so it is more difficult to mitigate the effect of unfavorable changes by selling the affected assets before the change 

changes in tax laws or capital markets  which result in excess capital flowing into new real estate development and excess real estate supply 

when equity and or debt capital is unavailable or expensive for real estate companies as has been the case for equity securities since mid  security capital is adversely affected  primarily because fee earning capital markets transaction volume suffers  the value of assets under management  on which fees are based  is lower  and the ability to pursue attractive investment opportunities  including new start up companies  is limited and investees in the start up phase may need to reduce activities and incur related charges 
risks of changes in investments security capital intends to sell some of its investments and redeploy the capital into increasing its ownership in other affiliates which it believes will generate better returns over time as a result of operating performance and consolidation synergies 
these disposition and acquisition transactions may involve significant transaction expenses and market friction or price negotiations 
no assurance can be given that the improved operating performance and synergies contemplated by security capital will offset the expenses and pricing frictions these transactions may involve 
investment company act risk security capital is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act of  in reliance on an exemption provided by rule a issued under the investment company act 
the investment company act does not require security capital to register as an investment company because security capital is principally engaged in the real estate business through companies that it primarily controls 
to the extent security capital and its affiliates dispose of some of their equity interests or do not elect to participate in future equity offerings by its investees or those investees issue substantial additional equity securities in a business combination to unaffiliated parties  security capital s ownership interest in and control over those investees could diminish 
under those circumstances  security capital could potentially be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act 
security capital would suffer additional regulatory costs and expenses  and might be required to discontinue certain operations or investments  if the investment company act required it to register as an investment company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk security capital s exposure to market risks consists of interest rate risk related to its own borrowings and those of its consolidated investments and equity price risk related to its investments in marketable equity securities and its investments in sc preferred growth  sc us real estate shares  and sc european real estate shares which use fair value accounting 
security capital s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to mitigate interest rate risk  security capital borrows on a long term basis  primarily at fixed rates and staggered maturities  therefore  security capital s primary interest rate risk is related to its variable rate line of credit loc 
security capital occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments as hedges in anticipation of future long term debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk exposure 
security capital had no outstanding interest rate hedges as of december  or during  a consolidated subsidiary entered into two interest rate swap agreements 
at december   the notional amount under these swaps was million 
security capital manages its equity price risks by limiting the percentage of its assets invested in marketable equity securities for trading purposes 
as of december  and  less than and less than  respectively  of total assets were invested in marketable equity securities that were available for sale 
sensitivity analysis the table below represents the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on security capital and its consolidated affiliates in millions variable average hypothetical interest rate interest rate impact on exposure balance change earnings security capital loc homestead loc belmont mortgage notes security capital s investments in sc preferred growth  sc us real estate shares and sc european real estate shares all use fair value accounting and are subject to equity price risk 
a hypothetical change in the market value of these investments would amount to a million change in security capital s earnings
