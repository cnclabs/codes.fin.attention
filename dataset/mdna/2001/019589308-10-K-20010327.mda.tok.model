item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
introduction we have experienced significant growth  primarily resulting from the acquisition of solid waste businesses 
since january   we have completed acquisitions including acquisitions in the results of operations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for business combinations are included in our financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  we believe our historical results of operations for the periods presented are not directly comparable to our current results of operations 
on july   we completed the acquisition of browning ferris industries  inc bfi in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
as a result of the acquisition  each share of bfi common stock was converted into the right to receive in cash 
including assumed and refinanced debt  the original cost of acquiring bfi was approximately billion 
financing for the acquisition was obtained from draws of billion from credit facilities with a capacity of billion the credit facility  the sale of billion of newly issued senior convertible preferred stock the preferred stock and the sale of billion of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
in connection with the acquisition of browning ferris industries  inc bfi  we initiated an asset divestiture program  whereby we sold  for cash or through simultaneous buy and sell transactions  certain non core assets that did not fit with our vertical integration operating strategy for total net proceeds of approximately billion 
as of december   we had completed this divestiture program with the exception of the transaction involving the waste incineration business of american ref fuel 
a definitive agreement was entered into during november and is expected to be completed around the first quarter of status of integration of bfi 
in connection with the acquisition of bfi on july   we anticipated annual cost savings of approximately million by the end of resulting from corporate and field sg a savings  operations labor cost savings  market cost savings and asset buy and sell agreements 
as of june   we had substantially achieved the annual cost savings through headcount reductions of approximately  employees  the closure of facilities  route rationalizations and other cost savings 
internalization increased from at the time of the acquisition to at december  we have completed the management information systems conversions from bfi s systems to allied s systems for financial reporting  payroll  fixed assets and maintenance tracking 
we have also completed the conversion of the general ledger and accounts payable from bfi s sap system to allied s system 
we have not experienced any significant operational  accounting or reporting issues related to these conversions 
general revenues 
our revenues are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we generally provide collection services under direct agreements with our customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
commercial and municipal contract terms  generally range from one to five years and commonly have renewal options 
our landfill operations include both company owned landfills and those operated for municipalities for a fee 
the following tables show for the periods indicated the percentage of our total reported revenues attributable to services provided and revenues attributable to geographic regions 
revenues by line of business in thousands  except percentages years ended december  collection    disposal    recycling    other    intercompany    reported revenues    transfer revenues are included in disposal 
revenues by region years ended december  atlantic central great lakes midwest northeast southeast southwest west other total revenues amounts relate primarily to our subsidiaries which provide services throughout the organization and not on a regional basis 
our strategy is to develop vertically integrated operations to internalize the waste we collect and thus realize higher margins from our operations 
by disposing of waste at company owned and or operated landfills  we retain the margin generated through disposal operations that would otherwise be earned by third party landfills 
approximately of the waste we collect as measured by disposal volumes was disposed of at landfills we own and or operate for the year and this internalization rate had increased to approximately at the end of in addition  transfer stations are an integral part of the disposal process 
we locate our transfer stations in areas where our landfills are outside of the population centers in which we collect waste 
such waste is transferred to long haul trailers and economically transported to our landfills 
expenses 
cost of operations includes labor  maintenance and repairs  equipment and facility rent  utilities and taxes  the costs of ongoing environmental compliance  safety and insurance  disposal costs and costs of independent haulers transporting our waste to the disposal site 
disposal costs include certain landfill taxes  host community fees  payments under agreements with respect to landfill sites that are not owned  landfill site maintenance  fuel and other equipment operating expenses and accruals for estimated closure and post closure monitoring expenses anticipated to be incurred in the future 
we use a life cycle accounting method for landfills and the related closure and post closure liabilities 
this method applies the costs associated with acquiring  developing  closing and monitoring the landfills over the associated landfill capacity based on consumption 
on an annual basis  we update the development cost estimates which include the costs to develop the site as well as the individual cell construction costs  closure and post closure cost estimates and future capacity estimates for each landfill 
the cost estimates are prepared by company and third party engineers based on the applicable local  state and federal regulations and site specific permit requirements 
future capacity estimates are updated  using aerial surveys of each landfill to estimate utilized disposal capacity and remaining disposal capacity 
these cost and capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  sales cost  investor and community relations expenses and provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of other intangible assets and landfill airspace 
we use the units of production method for purposes of calculating the amortization rate at each landfill 
this methodology divides the costs associated with acquiring  permitting and developing the entire landfill by the total remaining capacity of that landfill 
the resulting per unit amortization rate is applied to each unit disposed at the landfill and is recorded as expense for that period 
costs associated with developing the landfill include direct costs such as excavation  liners  leachate collection systems  engineering and legal fees  and capitalized interest  which are capitalized and amortized based on consumed airspace 
estimated total future development cost for our active landfills is approximately billion  excluding interest to be capitalized  and we expect that this amount will be spent over the remaining operating lives of the landfills 
we have available disposal capacity of approximately billion cubic yards of capacity as of december  we believe that the costs associated with engineering  owning and operating landfills will increase in the future as a result of federal  state and local regulation as well as community participation in opposition to the landfill process 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise prices sufficiently to offset these increased expenses 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead  public affairs and other corporate services  as incurred 
goodwill amortization includes the amortization of costs paid in excess of the net assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
in connection with potential acquisitions  we incur and capitalize certain transaction costs and integration costs  which include stock registration  legal  accounting  consulting  engineering and other direct costs 
when an acquisition is accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations  these costs are charged to the statement of operations as acquisition related costs 
when an acquisition is accounted for using the purchase method for business combinations  these costs are capitalized 
we routinely evaluate capitalized transaction and integration costs  and we expense those costs related to acquisitions not likely to occur 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead and other corporate services  as incurred 
closure and post closure costs represent our financial commitment for the regulatory required costs associated with our future obligations for final closure  which is the closure of a cell of a landfill once the cell is no longer receiving waste  and post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills  which is required for up to years after a landfill s final closure 
we establish closure and post closure requirements based on the standards of subtitle d as implemented on a state by state basis 
we base closure and post closure accruals on cost estimates for capping and covering a landfill  methane gas control  leachate management and groundwater monitoring  and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after the site discontinues accepting waste 
we prepare site specific closure and post closure engineering cost estimates annually for landfills owned and or operated by us for which we are responsible for closure and post closure 
we accrue and charge closure and post closure costs based on accepted tonnage as landfill airspace is consumed to ensure that the total closure and post closure obligations are fully accrued for each landfill at the time that the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
for landfills purchased  we assess and accrue the closure and post closure liability at the time we assume closure responsibility based upon the estimated closure and post closure costs and the percentage of airspace utilized as of the date of acquisition 
after the date of acquisition  we accrue and charge closure and post closure costs as airspace is consumed 
we update and approve estimated closure and post closure liabilities annually based on assessments performed by in house and independent environmental engineers 
such costs may change in the future as a result of permit modifications or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements 
we accrue closure and post closure cost estimates based on the present value of the future obligation 
we discount future costs where we believe that both the amounts and timing of related payments are reliably determinable 
we annually update our estimates of future closure and post closure costs 
we account for the impact of changes  which are determined to be changes in estimates  on a prospective basis 
in  we calculated the net present value of the closure and post closure commitment assuming inflation of and a risk free capital rate of 
we accrete discounted amounts previously recorded to reflect the effects of the passage of time 
we currently estimate total future payments for closure and post closure to be billion 
the present value of such estimate is billion 
at december  and  accruals for landfill closure and post closure costs including costs assumed through acquisitions were approximately million and million  respectively 
the accruals reflect a portfolio of landfills with estimated remaining lives  based on current waste flows  that range from one to over years  and an estimated average remaining life of approximately years 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship that the various items bears to revenues for the periods indicated

revenues in were billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisition of companies throughout  the most significant of which was bfi which was acquired on july  accordingly  the results in include twelve months of the operations acquired from bfi compared to five months in revenues attributable to existing operations increased approximately in compared to primarily due to pricing increases 
volume increases during were offset by initiatives to reduce customer accounts which were not generating acceptable returns

cost of operations in was billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
the increase in cost of operations was primarily associated with the increase in revenues described above 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations decreased to in from in  primarily due to price increases  the initiatives to reduce customer accounts which were not generating acceptable returns  the achievement of operating synergies resulting from the bfi acquisition  and the effect of increased landfill internalization from at the end of to at the end of selling  general and administrative expenses

depreciation and amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to in from in the percent decrease is primarily due to the increase in depreciation expense  resulting from a increase in capital expenditures  being more than offset by the greater increase in revenues during goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in goodwill amortization was due to an increase in goodwill of approximately billion primarily resulting from the acquisition of bfi 
acquisition related and unusual costs year ended december  during  we recorded approximately million of acquisition related and unusual costs primarily associated with the acquisition of bfi 
these costs were comprised primarily of approximately million of transition costs related to transitional employees and duplicative facilities and operations  million relating to changes in estimated loss contract provisions  restructuring and abandonment liabilities  litigation liabilities and environmental related matters  million of non cash asset impairments related to the divestitures of certain operations and we reversed through acquisition related and unusual costs approximately million of accruals established in connection with the acquisition of bfi and accruals associated with acquisitions 
subsequent event as part of our ongoing review of the operations and the self funding market development program for  we sold certain non integrated operations in the northeast region for approximately million during the month of february the proceeds were used to repay debt  but will likely be deployed later this year as a part of our self funding market development program to purchase assets in other markets that improve our market density and internalization 
in connection with this sale  we will reflect an after tax non cash loss of approximately million in the reported results for the first quarter of year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded million of acquisition related and unusual costs primarily associated with the billion acquisition of bfi  which was accounted for as a purchase 
the costs primarily relate to environmental related matters  litigation liabilities  risk management liabilities  loss contract provisions  transition costs and the write off of deferred costs relating to the acquisition 
these costs are comprised of the following we recorded a charge of approximately million related to changes in estimates of environmental liabilities associated with bfi s operations 
in connection with our due diligence and integration process  assessments of the acquired operations were performed by third party  in house engineers and legal counsel 
based on these assessments  we made changes in accounting estimates of approximately i million associated with the superfund accrual for over cercla cases in which bfi was involved  ii million associated with the remedial accrual for sites in which bfi was involved with remedial action plans  iii million associated with the environmental accrual for various containment and treatment matters at active or closed bfi landfills  and iv million associated with the accrual for the remedial and closure requirements of four bfi closed hazardous waste facilities 
in we recorded a charge of approximately million related to changes in estimates of litigation liabilities associated with bfi s operations 
in connection with our due diligence and integration process  assessments of the acquired operations and outstanding litigation were performed by third party and in house legal counsel 
we evaluated over cases involving employee related matters  regulatory matters  collection matters  contract disputes and other commercial litigation matters 
accordingly  we increased the litigation accrual based on the most probable loss to be incurred 
in we recorded an increase of approximately million to the self insurance accruals based on the results of a third party actuarial review performed in connection with due diligence and integration of the bfi acquisition 
as of september   we instituted a guaranteed cost insurance program for all casualty insurance coverages 
in connection with the integration of the bfi acquisition  we reviewed the existing contracts of the business for recoverability 
several contracts were identified which were in a loss position when the direct costs excluding any non variable type costs attributable to the contract were deducted from the revenue to be generated by the contract 
consistent with our accounting policies  we recorded a charge of approximately million to operations for the excess of costs over revenues of the identified contracts 
as a result of the acquisition of bfi  management reassessed the level of acquisitions that it would pursue in the future and decided that certain companies that were being considered would no longer be pursued 
accordingly  we wrote off million of deferred charges previously incurred in connection with these potential acquisitions 
additionally  we wrote off million of commitment fees paid in connection with a portion of the financing of the bfi acquisition 
these fees were associated with funds that were not ultimately drawn due to alternative sources of financing becoming available 
however  as secured financing for the entire purchase price of the acquisition was a condition of the signing of the merger agreement with bfi  and the debt associated with these fees was not incurred  the cost was written off in the third quarter of in connection with the integration plan for bfi  we identified and notified approximately  employees that they would be retained for a specified period  generally not exceeding months from the acquisition date  to perform transition related functions 
subsequent to the specified time period  they were terminated 
additionally  we identified certain offices and operations which were duplicative 
as these transition costs cannot be expensed or accrued until committed or paid  approximately million of transition costs were expensed during additionally  we accrued approximately million of committed transition costs during additionally  we recorded approximately million of non cash asset impairments related to the valuation of allied assets held for sale  approximately million of non cash asset impairments related to duplicate facilities  and approximately million of restructuring and abandonment costs related to other acquisitions 
any subsequent changes in estimates of acquisition related and unusual costs have been and will be included in the acquisition related and unusual costs caption of the statement of operations in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
during  approximately million of accrued acquisition related costs associated with acquisitions were reversed to acquisition related and unusual costs

interest expense  net of interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in primarily results from twelve months of interest expense on debt incurred and assumed in connection with the acquisition of bfi as compared to five months in income taxes 
income taxes reflect an effective tax rate of in and in the effective income tax rate in deviates from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the non deductibility of the amortization related to billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
extraordinary loss  net 
in september  we repaid the tranche d term loan prior to its maturity date 
in connection with this repayment  we recognized a non cash extraordinary charge for the early extinguishment of the debt of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs 
in february  we repaid the asset sale term loan facility prior to its maturity date 
in connection with this repayment  we recognized a non cash extraordinary charge for the early extinguishment of the debt of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to the write off of deferred debt issuance costs

as a result  we recorded a charge of million  net of related tax  during  to reflect the cumulative effect on prior years of the change in the method of interest capitalization 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million in and million in  which reflects the dividend on the preferred stock issued on july  in connection with the financing of the acquisition of bfi 
dividends were not paid in cash  instead  the liquidation preference of the preferred stock increased by accrued  but unpaid dividends 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues in were billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisition of bfi on july  and the inclusion in our results of bfi revenues for the period july  through december  bfi s pro forma revenue adjusted to reflect the sale of bfi s canadian operations and medical waste operations was approximately billion 
cost of operations 
cost of operations in was billion compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in cost of operations was primarily attributable to the inclusion of bfi s cost of operations associated with the revenues from july  through december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations increased to in from in  primarily due to the change in revenue mix resulting from the acquisition of bfi 
bfi s revenue mix was more heavily weighted towards collection revenue  which has lower margins than landfill revenues

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of  and reflects our acquisition of bfi 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to in from in the decrease is primarily due to the significant increase in revenues from our acquisition of bfi which more than offset the corresponding increase in depreciation due to the acquisition of bfi 
additionally  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we ceased recording depreciation on assets held for sale during such depreciation would have been approximately million 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in goodwill amortization was due to an increase in goodwill of approximately billion primarily resulting from the acquisition of bfi 
acquisition related and unusual costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of acquisition related and unusual costs primarily associated with the billion acquisition of bfi  which was accounted for as a purchase 
the costs primarily relate to environmental related matters  litigation liabilities  risk management liabilities  loss contract provisions  transition costs  and the write off of deferred costs relating to the acquisition 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in debt of approximately billion from the acquisition of bfi  which was outstanding for five months in additionally  capitalized interest decreased to million in from million in due to the change in accounting principle 
income taxes 
income taxes reflect an effective tax rate of in and in the effective income tax rate in deviates from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the non deductible nature of certain acquisition related charges and the non deductibility of the amortization related to billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
the effective income tax rate in deviates from the federal statutory rate primarily due to applying the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations including the initial recording of deferred income taxes and non deductible transaction costs  partially offset by the absence of income taxes on s corporation pre combination earnings 
without considering the effect of the acquisition related charges the effective tax rate was 
extraordinary loss  net 
in july  in connection with our financing of the bfi acquisition  we replaced our credit facility and recognized an extraordinary charge of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs 
in december  we replaced our notes and senior discount notes with billion in senior notes and recognized a charge of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to premiums paid for the early payment of the notes and the senior discount notes and the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs

dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million in and reflect the dividend on the preferred stock issued on july  in connection with the financing of the acquisition of bfi 
dividends were not paid in cash  instead  the liquidation preference of the preferred stock increased by accrued  but unpaid dividends 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs derived from operations are met with operating cash flow and when non operating liquidity needs arise they are met  if not from remaining operating cash flow  with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash provided by operations for the year was million  which included million spent on non recurring acquisition related accruals and transition costs 
this exceeded operating capital expenditure requirements of approximately million  including capitalized interest of million  by million 
non operating items provided liquidity during of million primarily derived from the divestiture of solid waste businesses net of the acquisition of such businesses for million 
during we were able to pay million of our debt using the excess cash provided by both operating and non operating sources 
during the year ending december  we expect to generate excess cash provided by both operating and non operating sources that will allow us to repay between million and million of our debt 
we have historically operated with a working capital deficit and we expect that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
the working capital deficit is generally caused by the current portion of non recurring market development related obligations  million as of december  in addition  we regularly use excess available cash from operating and non operating activities to pay amounts owed on our revolving line of credit  which is classified as long term 
non recurring market development related obligations are primarily related to the bfi acquisition and are expected to decrease over subsequent years 
we expect cash flows to be derived from the following components all amounts are approximate anticipated ranges o adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from billion to billion  o other non cash items  including provision for closure  post closure and allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million  o cash interest from million to million  o cash taxes from million to million  o closure  post closure and environmental expenditures from million to million  o capital expenditures from million to million  o debt reduction from american ref fuel transaction of million  o non recurring payments against acquisition accruals from million to million  o cash taxes and payments related to acquisitions and divestitures in prior years of million

during  we acquired solid waste operations  representing approximately million million net of intercompany eliminations in annual revenues  and sold operations representing approximately million million net of intercompany eliminations in annual revenues 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
our debt structure consisted primarily of billion outstanding under the credit facility  billion of the notes  billion of the senior notes and billion of debt assumed in connection with the bfi acquisition 
as of december  there was aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility of the credit facility of approximately million to be used for working capital  letters of credit  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement and the indentures relating to the notes and the senior notes contain financial and operating covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 
a substantial portion of our available cash will be required to service this indebtedness 
for fiscal  our required debt service is expected to be approximately million consisting of approximately million in principal repayments and between approximately to million in interest payments 
these amounts may vary depending upon changes in interest rates 
we are also required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations 
we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by issuing surety bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits as they relate to landfill closure and post closure costs 
at december   we had outstanding approximately billion in financial assurance instruments  represented by million of surety bonds   million of insurance policies  million of trust deposits and million of letters of credit 
during the calendar year  we expect to continue to provide approximately billion in financial assurance instruments relating to our landfill operations 
subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities 
our ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements  to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest  or to refinance our indebtedness  and to fund capital amounts required for the expansion of the existing business depends on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that future financings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing would be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
further  depending on the timing  amount and structure of any possible future acquisitions and the availability of funds under the credit facility  we may need to raise additional capital 
we may raise such funds through additional bank financings or public or private offerings of our debt and equity securities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure such funding  if necessary  on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are not successful in securing such funding  our ability to pursue our business strategy may be impaired and results of operations for future periods may be negatively affected 
see note to allied s consolidated financial statements 
significant financing events in july  in connection with the completion of the acquisition of bfi  we entered into new financing arrangements and repaid all amounts borrowed under the then existing credit facility and all amounts borrowed by bfi under its commercial paper program 
the new financing arrangements were i the credit facility for allied waste north america  inc allied na  a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of allied  which is guaranteed by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries including bfi and its subsidiaries  from a bank group for billion to provide financing for the acquisition of bfi and working capital for us following the acquisition  ii the sale of the billion principal amount notes by allied na which are guaranteed by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries including bfi and its subsidiaries  and iii the sale for billion of the preferred stock 
in connection with the completion of the acquisition of bfi  we also guaranteed certain of bfi s remaining debt and  for the senior notes and for certain of bfi s remaining debt  we provided collateral  which is also collateral for the credit facility 
both the credit facility and the notes contain restrictions on allied s ability to make acquisitions  purchase fixed assets above certain amounts  pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness  make investments  loans or advances  enter into certain transactions with affiliates or enter into a merger  consolidation or sale of all or a substantial portion of allied s assets 
the credit facility  the notes and the preferred stock contain provisions  which could require repayment  in some cases at a premium upon a defined change of control of allied 
the preferred stock also contains restrictions on allied s ability to pay cash dividends on common stock 
subsequent event 
on january   we issued million of senior secured notes  due  in a private placement under rule a of the securities act of we used the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of these notes to ratably repay portions of tranches a  b and c of the term loans under the credit facility  million of which was due in september we expect to file a registration statement to register these notes under the securities act of within days of the offering date 
coincident with the offering we amended our credit facilities to change certain financial covenants to provide us with greater operating flexibility 
new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

this statement amends the accounting and reporting standards of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  with respect to specific interpretations and circumstances  and incorporates certain decisions arising from the derivatives implementation group process 
in june  the implementation date of sfas no 
was deferred one year from the original date to those fiscal years beginning after june  by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
s and require all derivatives to be recorded as either assets or liabilities and the instruments to be measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are to be recognized immediately in earnings  other comprehensive income or deferred  depending on the use of the derivative  and whether or not it qualifies as a hedge 
the statement requires a formal documentation of hedge designation and assessment of the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we adopted sfas no 
s and on january   as required 
in the process of adoption of sfas we have reviewed all significant transactions and contracts for derivative activity and determined that our interest rate swap agreements are our only transactions representing derivative instruments that require a change in accounting under sfas no 
and we have interest rate risk relating to long term variable rate debt 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements when such transactions will serve to reduce the aggregate exposure of future cash flows to volatility or adverse movements in interest rates 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into solely for the purpose of reducing risk  positions are not taken for speculative purposes 
our interest rate swaps are properly designated as  and are effective as  hedges of our variable rate debt 
we assume no ineffectiveness in our interest rate hedges  as the notional amounts  indices  repricing dates  and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  and accordingly  at january   the mark to market value of these instruments was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in other comprehensive income oci in the amount of million net of tax 
the effect of the swaps will be matched against interest expense for the related variable rate debt over the terms of the swaps

risk factors leverage and ability to service debt 
we have had and will continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements 
at december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences 
for example it could o make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  o increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the industry in which we operate  o increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases for the portion of unhedged debt under our credit facility  o place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  o limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  and o subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material negative effect on us 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payment on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity 
we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our credit facility  and certain of the agreements governing our other indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payment to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied 
we must also comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions which may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
in addition  our credit facility and these other agreements contain additional affirmative and negative covenants  including limitation on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to make acquisitions and capital expenditures which could affect our ability to operate our business 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we could be in default under those agreements  and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under that credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness or prevent us from making debt service payments on any other indebtedness we owe 
if we are unable to repay any borrowings when due  the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against their collateral  which includes collateral securing the notes and the guarantees 
in addition any default under our credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
competition 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is highly competitive 
we compete with large companies and municipalities which may have greater financial and operations resources 
we also compete with the use of alternatives to landfill disposal because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is led by three large national waste management companies allied  waste management  inc  and republic services  inc 
it also includes numerous regional and local companies 
many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax exempt financing and may control the disposal of waste collected within their jurisdictions 
we encounter competition due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and incineration 
further  most of the states in which we operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that require counties to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling or other programs 
state and local governments are increasingly mandating waste reduction at the source and prohibiting the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard wastes  at landfills 
these trends may reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas 
if this occurs  we cannot assure that we will be able to operate our landfills at their full capacity or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for services 
we also encounter competition in our acquisition of landfills and collection operations 
this competition is due to our competitors interest in acquiring solid waste assets 
business strategy 
over the long term  our ability to continue to sustain our current vertical integration strategy will depend on our ability to replace  through acquisition or development  appropriate landfill capacity  collection operations and transfer stations 
we cannot assure that we will be able to replace such assets either timely or cost effectively or integrate acquisition candidates effectively or profitably 
further  we cannot assure that we will be successful in expanding the permitted capacity of our current landfills once our landfill capacity is full 
in such event  we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to another of our landfills  which could significantly increase our waste disposal expenses 
acquisitions may increase our capital requirements because acquisitions require sizable amounts of capital  and competition with other solid waste companies that have a similar acquisition strategy may increase prices 
if acquisition candidates are unavailable or too costly  we may need to change our business strategy 
in addition  we cannot assure that we will successfully obtain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other regulatory measures 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups 
a failure to obtain the required permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material negative effect on our future results of operations 
limited operating history with regard to recently acquired businesses 
during  and  we acquired companies  including bfi  with annualized revenues of approximately billion and sold operations with annualized revenues of approximately billion 
thus  we have only a limited history of operating a significant portion of our business 
it is also possible that we will acquire landfills  collection operations and transfer stations in the future 
although we believe we have substantially completed the integration of bfi  future acquisitions may pose integration problems and expected financial benefits and operational efficiencies may not be realized 
our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations could have a material negative effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
ongoing capital requirements 
our ability to remain competitive  sustain our growth and operations and expand operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
we intend to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary 
however  we may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment obligations and to fund our growth 
we spent approximately million for capital expenditures and closure and post closure and remediation expenditures related to our landfill operations during  and we expect to spend approximately million for these purposes in if we undertake more acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  closure and post closure and remediation expenditures will increase 
the increase in expenditures may result in low levels of working capital or require us to finance working capital deficits 
our cash needs will increase if the expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring increase above the current reserves taken for these costs 
expenditures for these costs may increase as a result of any federal  state or local government regulatory action 
these factors  together with those discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and therefore impair our ability to invest in our existing facilities or new facilities 
our ability to pay our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance 
our future performance may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we believe that our current available cash flow and borrowings available under our credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future requirements for working capital  letters of credit  closure  post closure and remediation expenditures  acquisition related expenditures and capital expenditures 
we may need to refinance our credit facility  the senior subordinated notes  the assumed bfi debt  the senior notes  and or other indebtedness to pay the principal amounts due at maturity 
in addition  we may need additional capital to fund future acquisitions 
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to pay our debt obligations and capital expenditures 
economic conditions 
our business is affected by general economic conditions 
we cannot assure that an economic downturn will not result in a reduction in the volume of waste being disposed of at our operations and or the price that we can charge for our services 
weather conditions 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely affected by long periods of inclement weather which interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity and or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  certain of our operations may be temporarily suspended as a result of particularly harsh weather conditions 
long periods of inclement weather could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
dependence on senior management 
we depend highly upon our senior management team 
we will continue to require operations management personnel with waste industry experience 
we do not know the availability of such experienced management personnel or how much it may cost to attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management personnel could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
influence of government regulation and other third party actions 
our equipment  facilities  and operations are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety 
these include  among other things  laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
our compliance with regulatory requirements is costly 
we are often required to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or  in some cases  to close landfills 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these standards 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we are involved in administrative and judicial proceedings related to environmental matters 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or may lose certain permits and licenses 
we also may have to defend ourselves against governmental agencies and surrounding landowners who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury  property damage and or violations of permits and licenses by us 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
certain of our waste disposal operations traverse state and county boundaries 
in the future  our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by proposed federal legislation that authorizes the states to enact legislation governing interstate shipments of waste 
such proposed federal legislation may allow individual states to prohibit or limit importing out of state waste to be disposed of and may require states  under certain circumstances  to reduce the amount of waste exported to other states 
if this or similar legislation is enacted in states in which we operate landfills that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out of state  our operations could be negatively affected 
we believe that several states have proposed or have considered adopting legislation that would regulate the interstate transportation and disposal of waste in the states landfills 
our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by flow control legislation which may be proposed in the united states congress 
this proposed federal legislation may allow states and local governments to direct waste generated within their jurisdiction to a specific facility for disposal or processing 
if this or similar legislation is enacted  state or local governments with jurisdiction over our landfills could act to limit or prohibit disposal or processing of waste in our landfills 
potential environmental liability 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
due to the limited nature of our insurance coverage of environmental liability  if we were to incur substantial financial liability for environmental damage  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
hazardous substances liability 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at numerous sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or cercla 
cercla has been interpreted to impose strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners or operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance  on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility and on persons who transport such substances to facilities selected by such persons 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
the statute provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes costs on the responsible parties 
the expense of conducting such a cleanup can be significant 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by acquired companies 
cleanup liability may also arise under various state laws similar to cercla 
as used in this report  non hazardous waste means substances that are not defined as hazardous waste under federal regulations 
potential undisclosed liabilities associated with our acquisitions 
we may be exposed to liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in connection with acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition made by us  there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or are unable to discover including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners and for which we  as successor owner  may be responsible 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
we are unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
seasonality we believe that our collection  transfer and landfill operations can be adversely affected by protracted periods of inclement weather which could delay the development of landfill capacity or transfer of waste and or reduce the volume of waste generated 
severe weather can negatively effect the costs of collection and disposal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
to moderate the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we have effectively converted a significant portion of our long term debt  which requires payment at variable rates of interest  to fixed rate obligations through interest rate swap transactions 
these transactions required us to pay fixed rates of interest on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us variable rates of interest on the same notional amounts of principal 
increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact earnings and cash flow as a significant portion of variable rate debt had been swapped for fixed rates 
in addition  increases or decreases in long term market interest rates would effect the fair value of our long term debt offset by change to the fair value of our swap portfolio
