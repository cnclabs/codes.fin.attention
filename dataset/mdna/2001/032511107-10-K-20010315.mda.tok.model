the company s average wellhead gas price in was up over anadarko s average wellhead gas price in increased from natural gas markets improved significantly in  with the company s average realized price increasing from per mcf in to per mcf in the stronger prices were the result of lower nationwide production volumes and higher gas demand  particularly from electric power generation facilities 
natural gas markets were volatile in  with the company s average monthly price fluctuating from a high of per mcf in january to a low of per mcf in september anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage production and sales volumes and mitigate the effect of the price volatility  which is likely to continue in the future

production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices 
anadarko s average realized crude oil price for increased compared to the improvement in crude oil prices for was due in large part to a decrease in the production quotas among the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
crude oil prices in were up compared to the company s ngls sales volumes in increased compared to ngls sales volumes in were essentially flat compared to the average ngls price was up compared to by comparison  ngls prices were above ngls production is dependent on natural gas prices and the economics of processing the natural gas volumes to extract ngls 
marketing strategies natural gas the north american natural gas market has grown significantly throughout the last years and management believes continued growth to be likely 
natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so 
management believes the company s excellent portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position anadarko to continue to participate in this growth 
anadarko s wholly owned marketing subsidiary anadarko energy services company aes is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing and services tailored to its customers needs 
approximately of the company s gas production was sold through aes in aes also purchases and sells third party gas in the company s market areas 
approximately of the company s gas production was sold under long term contracts to duke energy in aes sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
aes has expanded its marketing capabilities to move larger volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various hedging strategies to better manage price risk associated with natural gas sales

crude oil and condensate anadarko s revenues are derived from production in the us  canada  algeria  and other international areas 
presently  most of the company s us crude oil production is sold on day evergreen contracts with prices based on postings plus a premium 
most of the company s canada oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater 
oil from the hbns field in algeria is lifted by tanker load and sold as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a very high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel 
aes purchases and sells third party crude oil and condensate in the company s domestic and international market areas 
gas gathering systems and processing anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
the vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
anadarko processes gas and has interests in one operated plant and three non operated plants 
additionally  the company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction and sale of ngls in efficient plants with flexible commitments 
anadarko s strategy to aggregate gas through company owned and third party gathering systems allows anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the company has significant production 
anadarko increased its gas marketing opportunities by purchasing the stock of pinnacle gas treating  inc the transaction valued at million  which closed in january  gives anadarko ownership of a natural gas pipeline that runs through the heart of its bossier properties 
the acquisition provides the company greater flexibility in shipping and marketing its gas from the area as well as improved service to other shippers 
the network  which has a capacity of mmcf d of gas  consists of miles of large diameter pipe  miles of small diameter laterals and spurs in addition to a mile fuel redelivery system 
the bethel treating plant acquired in the transaction removes carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from gas and can handle as much as mmcf d of gas 
in  anadarko has plans to expand the bethel plant to accommodate growing volumes in the area 
operating results drilling activity during  anadarko participated in a total of gross wells  including gas wells  oil wells and dry holes 
this compares to gross wells gas wells  oil wells and dry holes in and gross wells gas wells  oil wells and dry holes in the increase in activity during was a result of the rme merger and improved commodity prices

reserve replacement drilling activity is not the best measure of success for an exploration and production company 
anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
the company believes its performance in both areas is excellent 
for the th consecutive year  anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls  stated on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis 
during  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement was  including the effect of the rme merger transaction or excluding the effect of the rme merger transaction  of total production which reached a record of mmboe 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production of mmboe 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production of mmboe 
over the last five years  the company s annual reserve replacement has averaged of annual production volumes or excluding the effect of the rme merger transaction 
anadarko continues to increase its energy reserves in the us in  the company replaced or excluding the effect of the rme merger transaction of its us production volumes with us reserves 
this compares to a us reserve replacement of in and in the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was of production or excluding the rme merger transaction 
by comparison  the most recent published us industry average was 
source us department of energy anadarko s us reserve replacement performance for the same period was of production 
industry data for are not yet available 
cost of finding cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development 
a better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period 
anadarko has generally outperformed the industry in average finding costs 
for the period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe  which includes the cost of acquiring the rme reserves 
stated excluding the effect of the rme merger transaction  anadarko s finding cost for the same period was per boe 
the company s us finding performance for the same period was per boe or per boe excluding the effect of the rme merger transaction 
industry data for are not yet available 
for comparison purposes  the most recent published five year average for the industry shows worldwide finding cost was per boe and us finding cost was per boe 
source arthur andersen for the same five year period of  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe and its us finding cost was per boe 
for  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe or per boe excluding the effect of the rme merger transaction 
this compares to per boe in and per boe in anadarko s us finding cost for was per boe or per boe excluding the effect of the rme merger transaction 
this compares to per boe in and per boe in finding costs in have increased partly due to increases in oilfield services costs 
proved reserves at the end of  anadarko s proved reserves were billion boe compared to mmboe at year end and mmboe at year end reserves increased by in compared to due primarily to the rme merger and exploration and development drilling in both the us and overseas 
anadarko s proved reserves have grown by over the past three years  primarily as a result of the rme merger and successful exploration projects in alaska  algeria and the gulf of mexico  as well as successful exploitation and development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and producing property acquisitions 
the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were trillion cubic feet tcf  compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved gas reserves have increased since year end  reflecting the rme merger and continued development activity onshore in the us anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end increased to billion barrels  compared to mmbbls at year end and mmbbls at year end crude oil reserves have risen by over the last three years primarily due to the rme merger and large discoveries in alaska  algeria and the gulf of mexico 
crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves comprise of the company s proved reserves at year end  compared to about at year end and at year end the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional performance data 
at december   the present value discounted at of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and was billion  after income taxes  stated in accordance with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec and financial accounting standards board 
the estimated present value of future net revenues  after income taxes  increased compared to primarily due to the addition of proved reserves related to the rme merger  significantly higher natural gas prices at year end and successful drilling worldwide 
see supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities unaudited in the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves  and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
acquisitions and divestitures the company s strategy includes an active asset acquisition and divestiture program 
in july  anadarko acquired approximately mmboe of proved reserves with the rme merger  located primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
excluding the rme merger transaction  during  anadarko acquired through purchases and trades mmboe of proved reserves for million 
during the same time period  the company sold properties  either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas  with proceeds totaling million 
reserves associated with these sales and trades were mmboe 
in february  anadarko announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire canadian based berkley petroleum corporation for c per share in cash for an equity value of about us million plus the assumption of debt estimated at us million 
the transaction is expected to close mid march in  the company is also considering dispositions of certain producing properties in non core areas 
properties and leases producing properties the company owns  net producing gas wells and  net producing oil wells worldwide 
the following schedule shows the number of developed and undeveloped lease acres in which anadarko held interests at december  acreage developed undeveloped total gross net gross net gross net thousands united states onshore lower       offshore   alaska   total       canada      algeria   other international     developed acreage in algeria relates only to areas with an exploitation license 
a portion of the undeveloped acreage in algeria will be relinquished in the future upon finalization of exploitation license boundaries 
land grant and other fee minerals the company also owns fee mineral acreage totaling  gross or  net acres as of december  of this amount   gross or  net acres are within the company s land grant area in wyoming  colorado and utah 
the company holds royalty interests of varying percentages in approximately one million gross acres of the land grant that are subject to exploration and production agreements with third parties 
the company s fee mineral acreage is primarily undeveloped 
regulatory matters environmental and safety the company s oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
other regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells  regulate well spacing  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service of the us department of the interior 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
additional factors affecting business the company has made in this report  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
these forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves  schedules  plans  timing of development  contributions from oil and gas properties  and those statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  projects  target  goal  plans  objective  should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k and in the company s other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management 
anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions and production quotas of opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail production and capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand for oil and gas in the us and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not fully insured against all risks in its business  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is involved in several large development projects 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include the major oil companies  independent oil and gas concerns  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
legal proceedings general the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including  but not limited to  royalty claims  contract claims and environmental claims 
the company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims  including numerous claims by employees of third party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos and benzene while working at a refinery in corpus christi  which the company sold in segments in and while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company  although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved 
for a description of certain legal proceedings in which the company is involved  see legal proceedings under item of this form k

capital spending for has been set at billion  a increase compared to the capital budget for includes billion for development  million for exploration  million for gas gathering and other  and million for capitalized interest and overhead 
the primary focus of the budget is to find additional natural gas reserves and increase gas production in the lower  the gulf of mexico and in canada 
more than half of the capital budget is earmarked primarily for ongoing development drilling and construction to increase production from existing fields in texas  the gulf of mexico  the rockies  western canada  the north slope of alaska and algeria 
about of the capital budget will be spent on ongoing exploration programs primarily in the sub salt and deep waters of the gulf of mexico  canada and in texas  but also on new prospects in the north atlantic  west africa  tunisia  australia and the former soviet republic of georgia 
another is budgeted for construction of plants  gathering and treating facilities and pipelines 
anadarko believes that cash flow and existing or available credit facilities will provide the majority of funds to meet its capital and operating requirements for the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property sales and additional borrowing  to secure other funds for capital development 
at this time  anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments anadarko s derivative commodity instruments currently are comprised of futures  swaps and options contracts 
the volume of derivative commodity instruments utilized by the company to hedge its market price risk and in its energy trading operation can vary during the year within the boundaries of its established policy guidelines 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
derivative financial instruments utilized to manage or reduce commodity price risk related to the company s equity production with the exception of net written options are accounted for under the hedge or deferral method of accounting 
under this method  realized gains losses and option premiums are recognized in the statement of income when the underlying physical oil and gas production is sold 
accordingly  realized derivative gains losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the underlying physical oil and gas production 
realized derivative gains losses are reflected in the average sales price of the physical oil and gas production 
margin deposits  deferred realized gains losses and premiums are included in other current assets or liabilities 
unrealized gains losses are not recorded 
the majority of the derivatives into which the company enters have terms of less than months 
as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million gains of million and losses of million on derivative commodity instruments entered into to hedge equity production 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a increase in commodity prices  the potential additional loss on these derivative commodity instruments would be approximately million

rme was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported the gas marketing program within the gathering  processing and marketing gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke energy field services  inc duke 
most of the gpm business segment s firm long term transportation contracts were transferred to duke in the gpm disposition 
one contract was retained  but is managed and operated by duke 
anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the company s natural gas 
as part of the gpm disposition  rme and duke agreed rme will pay duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke will pay rme if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
transportation contracts transferred to duke in the gpm disposition  and the contract not transferred  all of which are included in the keep whole agreement with duke relate to various pipelines 
this keep whole agreement is accounted for on a mark to market basis as a part of the company s marketing activities
