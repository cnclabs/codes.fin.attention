general the performance of a radio station group is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the two components of broadcast cash flow are net revenues gross revenues net of agency commissions and operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and corporate general and administrative expense 
the primary source of revenues is the sale of broadcasting time for advertising 
the most significant operating expenses for purposes of the computation of broadcast cash flow are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  and advertising and promotion expenses 
management of the company strives to control these expenses by working closely with local station management 
the company s revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenues 
the second and third quarters generally produce the highest revenues 
another measure of operating performance is ebitda 
ebitda consists of operating income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda do not take into account the company s debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  broadcast cash flow and ebitda are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in the company s business or other discretionary uses
