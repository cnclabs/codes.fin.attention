item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements as a result of factors  including those discussed previously  under risk factors or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
overview we provide telecommunications carriers with a broad range of infrastructure equipment and related services designed to meet their specific and changing equipment needs 
we offer our customers a unique combination of new and de installed equipment from a variety of manufacturers  allowing them to make fast multi vendor purchases from a single cost effective source 
to further address our customers dynamic equipment needs  we offer a suite of customized  value added services including asset recovery  inventory management  technical support and other ancillary services under the umbrella of somera onesource services 
our innovative equipment and service offerings are delivered through our team of more than sales and procurement professionals  who work individually with customers to understand  anticipate and meet their ongoing equipment requirements 
our sales teams utilize our relationship management database  our selective inventory and our distribution infrastructure to provide our customers with rapidly deployable equipment solutions 
our customers include incumbent local exchange carriers  long distance carriers  wireless carriers  competitive local exchange carriers  and internet service providers 
incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  provided local telephone service on an exclusive basis prior to deregulation 
since deregulation  competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs  have competed with ilecs to provide local telecommunications service 
we do not manufacture any of the equipment we sell 
we purchase de installed equipment primarily from telecommunications carriers  many of whom are also our customers 
we purchase the new equipment we sell primarily from oems and distributors 
by using our relationship management database to track carriers de installed equipment we are able to offer our customers a broad range of equipment 
we generally have not entered into long term contracts or distribution arrangements with our suppliers  and if we fail to develop and maintain our relationships with our suppliers  our business will suffer 
a majority of our sales to date have been to customers located in the united states 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for   and of our net revenue in   and  respectively 
we expect sales to carriers in the united states to continue to account for the majority of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
through  all of our equipment sales were denominated in us dollars 
in  verizon communications accounted for of our net revenue 
in  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenue 
in  alltel accounted for of our net revenue 
in  western multiplex and an international carrier accounted for and of our equipment purchases 
in and  no suppliers accounted for more than of our equipment purchases 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the procurement and testing of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to be dependent  to a significant extent  on purchase orders 
these purchase orders can be delayed or canceled by our customers without penalty 
additionally  as telecommunications equipment supplier competition increases  we may need to lower our selling prices or pay more for the equipment we procure 
consequently  our gross margins may decrease over time 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated provisions for returns and warranty obligations where significant  when we ship equipment to our customers  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations 
the market for telecommunications equipment is characterized by intense competition 
we believe that our ability to remain competitive depends on enhancing the existing service levels we provide to our customers  acquiring access to a broader selection of equipment  developing new customer relationships and expanding our existing customer penetration levels 
to enhance our ability to meet these goals  we completed our first acquisition in october in december  we launched our business to business e commerce web site 
additionally  we opened our european headquarters in amsterdam  the netherlands in november corporate history we were organized as a california limited liability company  or llc  and commenced operations in july in july  we undertook a recapitalization in which outside investors purchased class b units representing approximately of somera communications  llc 
in august  we entered into a million term loan facility and a million revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions led by fleet national bank 
in november  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to payoff the fleet national bank term loan and revolving loan facilities  including associated accrued interest 
the balance of the proceeds have been invested in short term  interest bearing  investment grade marketable securities 
in october  we completed our acquisition of msi communications  inc  a data networking equipment and services company 
results of operations compared to net revenue 
substantially all of our net revenue consists of sales of new and de installed telecommunications and data networking equipment  including switching  transmission  access  wireless  microwave and power products 
net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue was driven by greater customer demand for our equipment in general rather than significant increases in the price of the products we sold  our expansion in united states markets and growth in significant customer accounts 
net revenue attributable to new equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue attributable to new equipment sales was due to greater customer demand for new telecommunications equipment and our offering a broader variety of new equipment to customers 
we believe that net revenue attributable to new equipment sales will continue to increase in response to customers demand for new telecommunications equipment 
net revenue attributable to de installed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue attributable to de installed equipment sales was due to greater demand among our customers in connection with the build out and servicing of their existing networks 
we believe net revenue attributable to de installed equipment will increase as our customers continue to build out their existing networks 
cost of net revenue 
substantially all of our cost of net revenue consists of the costs of the equipment we purchase from third party sources 
cost of net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue during this period is primarily attributable to increases in our volume of new and de installed equipment sales 
cost of net revenue attributable to new equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to new equipment was due primarily to increases in the volume of new equipment we sold rather than increased unit costs of equipment we purchased 
we believe these costs may continue to increase as we purchase additional new equipment to satisfy customer demand 
cost of net revenue attributable to de installed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to de installed equipment was due primarily to increased volume of de installed equipment sales and fluctuations due to large  non recurring purchases of de installed equipment 
we believe that the costs of net revenues attributable to de installed equipment will continue to increase as our volume of de installed equipment sales increases in response to customer demand 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  increased to in from in the increase in gross margins was primarily due to more favorable prices obtained from our suppliers due in part to our increased volume of purchases and opportunistic buys  offset by an increase in the proportion of new equipment we sold  which generally has lower gross margins than de installed equipment 
gross margin attributable to new equipment sales increased to in from in the increase in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales was due primarily to our ability to leverage the increased volume of purchases in negotiating more favorable pricing from our suppliers 
we believe these gross margins will continue to fluctuate depending upon the mix of the new equipment we sell 
gross margin attributable to de installed equipment sales increased to in from in the increase in gross margin attributable to de installed equipment sales was due primarily to our opportunistic purchases of de installed equipment in we believe that gross margins attributable to de installed equipment sales may continue to fluctuate depending upon the mix of de installed equipment we sell and our ability to make significant discounted purchases 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits for sales  marketing and procurement employees as well as costs associated with advertising  promotions and the research development and launch of our business to business e commerce initiative 
a majority of our sales and marketing expenses are incurred in connection with establishing and maintaining long term relationships with a variety of carriers 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million or of net revenue in from million or of net revenue in this increase was due to higher absolute commission expenses consistent with increased gross profit upon which our sales commissions are based  hiring of additional sales and procurement personnel  intensified marketing and advertising activities and costs associated with our e commerce initiative 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we expand our product and service offerings  increase our hiring of additional sales personnel and pay commissions consistent with increased gross profit  although such expenses may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees  and facility costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net revenue in from million or of net revenue in this increase was due primarily to the increase in employees relating to the expansion of our operations and associated facilities costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our operations  although such expenses may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation charges relate to stock options we issued to two officers and one outside director in resulting in unearned stock based compensation of  which is being amortized over the vesting period  generally four years  of the underlying options 
amortization of the stock option charge in and amounted to  and  respectively 
we expect that the remaining charge will be amortized to net income as follows  in   in and  in also includes charges relating to warrants for common stock granted in exchange for services 
the warrants  which were fully vested at the date of grant  entitle the holders to purchase up to  shares of common stock and resulted in a one time charge of  in interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net consists of investment earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances  offset by interest expense associated with debt obligations 
interest income  net for was million 
interest expense  net was million in representing a one time write off of million of unamortized loan fees and interest on outstanding debt principal 
we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  income tax provision benefit 
income tax provision for totaled million  an effective tax rate of  compared to an income tax benefit of million in in the fourth quarter of  we realized a million deferred tax credit as a result of the change in tax status of the company from a limited liability company to a c corporation 
this deferred tax asset will be amortized over years 
as a limited liability company  we were not subject to federal or state income taxes 
business combinations 
in october  the company acquired msi communications inc this transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
the financial results of msi have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the company paid million in cash and acquisition costs and issued  shares of its common stock  which are held in escrow at december  for further details about this acquisition  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect this acquisition will help us build our base of customers and establish new products and services in the data networking equipment and services markets 
compared to net revenue 
net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue was driven by greater customer demand for our equipment in general rather than significant increases in the price of the products we sold  our expansion in united states markets and growth in significant customer accounts

cost of net revenue attributable to de installed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to de installed equipment was due primarily to increased volume of de installed equipment sales and fluctuations due to large  non recurring purchases of de installed equipment 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  declined to in from in the decline in gross margins was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of new equipment we sold  which generally has lower gross margins than de installed equipment  fluctuations in the prices of a number of our purchase transactions  and increased competition in the procurement of de installed equipment generally 
gross margin attributable to new equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales was due primarily to fluctuations in the mix of equipment we sold 
gross margin attributable to de installed equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to de installed equipment sales was due primarily to increased prices of the de installed equipment we purchased relating to a number of large  non recurring purchase transactions in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million or of net revenue in from million or of net revenue in this increase was due to higher absolute commission expenses consistent with increased gross profit upon which our sales commissions are based  as well as the hiring of additional sales and procurement personnel  including a new executive vice president of sales and marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net revenue in from million or of net revenue in this increase was due primarily to the increase in employees resulting from the expansion of our operations  as well as recruitment costs 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation charges relate to warrants for common stock granted in exchange for services and options granted to officers and a director in the warrants  which were fully vested at the date of grant  entitle the holders to purchase up to  shares of common stock and resulted in a one time charge of approximately  in in july  we issued stock options to two officers and one outside director resulting in unearned stock based compensation of  which will be amortized over the vesting period  generally four years  of the underlying options 
amortization of the stock option charge in amounted to  interest expense  net 
interest expense  net consists of interest expense associated with debt obligations offset by interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest expense  net increased to million in from  in this increase was due to the one time write off of million of unamortized loan fees as well as the higher level of outstanding debt principal to satisfy greater working capital needs 
income tax benefit 
in  we realized a million deferred tax credit as a result of the change in tax status of the company from a limited liability company to a c corporation in the fourth quarter of as a limited liability company in and through the third quarter of  we were not subject to federal or state income taxes 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth unaudited statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as the percentage of our net revenue represented by each item

our gross margin improved in versus primarily due to increased customer demand and more favorable pricing obtained from our suppliers 
sales and marketing expenses have increased in absolute dollars for every quarter reflecting greater commissions paid on increased gross profit  the addition of sales personnel and intensified marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased almost every quarter due to the increase in personnel and facilities costs and professional fees required to support our growth 
historically  our net revenue and results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations  particularly on a quarterly basis  and could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future 
causes of such fluctuations may include the rate and timing of customers orders for the equipment we sell  the rate at which telecommunications carriers de install equipment  decreases in the prices of the equipment we sell due to increased secondary market competition  our ability to locate and obtain equipment  our ability to deploy equipment on a timely basis  seasonal variations in customer purchasing  write offs due to inventory defects and obsolescence  the potentially long sales cycle for our equipment  delays in the commencement of operations in new markets  costs relating to possible acquisitions  and general economic conditions and conditions specific to the telecommunications industry 
significant quarterly fluctuations in our net revenue will cause significant fluctuations in our cash flows and working capital 
liquidity and capital resources since inception in july  we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations 
however  in  we made a strategic investment in inventory  resulting in an increase in inventory of million 
this combined with the increase in accounts receivable of million offset net income adjusted for non cash charges to result in the net use of cash in operating activities of million 
net cash generated by operating activities was million in and million in through november  substantially all of the cash generated by operating activities was distributed to the members of somera communications  llc 
in july  we used million from the sale of class b units to outside investors to repurchase outstanding units from a number of our initial unit holders 
on august   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by fleet national bank 
the credit agreement provided for a term loan facility and a revolving loan facility 
the term loan facility was for an aggregate principal amount of million 
the revolving loan facility allowed us to borrow million  with a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
the obligations under the term loan facility and the revolving loan facility were secured by a first priority lien on all our tangible and intangible assets 
the proceeds of our term loan facility were used to make a distribution to the members of somera communications  llc of million in september and the remaining million was used to pay off a portion of outstanding balances on notes payable 
additionally  approximately million of our revolving loan facility was used to pay off the current portion of the notes payable 
the remaining amount of notes payable  approximately  was satisfied from available cash 
on november   we sold  of our common shares at per share through an initial public offering  raising approximately million in net proceeds 
in november  we repaid and retired the outstanding balance of the term loan facility and the outstanding balance of the revolving loan facility with the proceeds of the offering 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we do not currently plan to pay dividends  but rather to retain earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth 
we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  we anticipate significant increases in working capital in the future primarily as a result of increased sales of equipment and higher relative levels of inventory 
we will also continue to expend significant amounts of capital on property and equipment related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters  distribution centers  equipment testing infrastructure  and additional facilities to support our growth  as well as expending significant resources in support of our business to business e commerce activities 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and related notes 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate in future periods  which might lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our annual or quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our annual quarterly operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our stock could significantly decline 
factors that could impact our operating results include o the rate  timing and volume of orders for the telecommunications infrastructure equipment we sell  o the rate at which telecommunications carriers de install their equipment  o decreases in our selling prices due to competition in the secondary market  o our ability to obtain products cost effectively from original equipment manufacturers  or oems  distributors  carriers and other secondary sources of telecommunications equipment  o our ability to provide equipment and service offerings on a timely basis to satisfy customer demand  o variations in customer capital spending patterns due to seasonality  economic conditions for telecommunications carriers and other factors  o write offs due to inventory defects or obsolescence  o the sales cycle for equipment we sell  which can be relatively lengthy  o delays in the commencement of our operations in new market segments and geographic regions  and o costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of new businesses 
our business depends upon our ability to match third party de installed equipment supply with carrier demand for this equipment and failure to do so could reduce our net revenue 
our success depends on our continued ability to match the equipment needs of telecommunications carriers with the supply of de installed equipment available in the secondary market 
we depend upon maintaining business relationships with third parties who can provide us with de installed equipment and information on available de installed equipment 
failure to effectively manage these relationships and match the needs of our customers with available supply of de installed equipment could damage our ability to generate net revenue 
in the event carriers decrease the rate at which they de install their networks  or choose not to de install their networks at all  it would be more difficult for us to locate this equipment  which could negatively impact our net revenue 
a downturn in the telecommunications industry or an industry trend toward reducing or delaying additional equipment purchases due to cost cutting pressures could reduce demand for our products 
we rely significantly upon customers concentrated in the telecommunications industry as a source of net revenue and de installed equipment inventory 
we believe that a downturn in the telecommunications industry in general or decreased carrier operating performance could result in reduced sales to our customers and postpone network upgrades 
these reduced sales could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and delayed projects could impair our ability to obtain de installed telecommunications equipment 
the market for supplying equipment to telecommunications carriers is competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our net revenue and gross margins might decline 
competition among companies who supply equipment to telecommunications carriers is intense 
we currently face competition primarily from three sources original equipment manufacturers  distributors and secondary market dealers who sell new and de installed telecommunications infrastructure equipment 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors  we may have to lower our selling prices and may experience reduced gross margins and loss of market share  either of which could harm our business 
competition is likely to increase as new companies enter this market  as current competitors expand their products and services or as our competitors consolidate 
increased competition in the secondary market for telecommunications equipment could also heighten demand for the limited supply of de installed equipment which would lead to increased prices for  and reduce the availability of  this equipment 
any increase in these prices could significantly impact our ability to maintain our gross margins 
we do not have many formal relationships with suppliers of telecommunications equipment and may not have access to adequate product supply 
in fiscal year  of our net revenue was generated from the sale of de installed telecommunications equipment 
typically  we do not have supply contracts to obtain this equipment and are dependent on the de installation of equipment by carriers to provide us with much of the equipment we sell 
our ability to buy de installed equipment from carriers is dependent on our relationships with them 
if we fail to develop and maintain these business relationships with carriers or they are unwilling to sell de installed equipment to us  our ability to sell de installed equipment will suffer 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
historically  a significant portion of our sales have been to relatively few customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our net revenue in  in and in in  verizon communications accounted for of our net revenue 
in  no single customer accounted for over of our net revenue 
in  alltel accounted for of our net revenue 
in addition  substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and no customer has entered into a long term purchasing agreement with us 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to purchase from us 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
we may be forced to reduce the sales prices for the equipment we sell  which may impair our ability to maintain our gross margins 
in the future we expect to reduce prices in response to competition and to generate increased sales volume 
if manufacturers reduce the prices of new telecommunications equipment we may be required to further reduce the price of the new and de installed equipment we sell 
if we are forced to reduce our prices or are unable to shift the sales mix towards higher margin equipment sales  we will not be able to maintain current gross margins 
the market for de installed telecommunications equipment is relatively new and it is unclear whether our equipment and service offerings and our business will achieve long term market acceptance 
the market for de installed telecommunications equipment is relatively new and evolving  and we are not certain that our potential customers will adopt and deploy de installed telecommunications equipment in their networks 
for example  with respect to de installed equipment that includes a significant software component  potential customers may be unable to obtain a license or sublicense for the software 
even if they do purchase de installed equipment  our potential customers may not choose to purchase de installed equipment from us for a variety of reasons 
our customers may also re deploy their displaced equipment within their own networks which would eliminate their need for our equipment and service offerings 
these internal solutions would also limit the supply of de installed equipment available for us to purchase  which would limit the development of this market 
failure by our customers to accept our internet sales strategy could result in lower than expected revenues 
in december  we launched our business to business web site to enable us to better serve our customers and vendors 
these web based services are very different from the traditional sales methods we currently have with our customers 
there can be no assurance about the degree to which our customers will utilize our internet solution 
if our customers fail to utilize our internet sales solution  our ability to increase our revenues could be harmed 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and sales personnel  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees 
the loss of any member of our senior management  in particular  dan firestone  our chief executive officer  or other key employees could negatively impact our operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we depend on our sales professionals to serve customers in each of our markets 
the loss of any of our sales professionals could significantly disrupt our relationships with our customers 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees except for dan firestone 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense 
additionally  we depend on our ability to train and develop skilled sales people and an inability to do so would significantly harm our growth prospects and operating performance 
we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing market 
the market for the equipment and services we sell is characterized by technological changes  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and frequent new equipment and service introductions 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend  in part  on our ability to timely and cost effectively o respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  o develop our internal technical capabilities and expertise  o broaden our equipment and service offerings  and o adapt our services to new technologies as they emerge 
our failure in any of these areas could harm our business 
moreover  any increased emphasis on software solutions as opposed to equipment solutions could limit the availability of de installed equipment  decrease customer demand for the equipment we sell  or cause the equipment we sell to become obsolete 
the lifecycles of telecommunications infrastructure equipment may become shorter  which would decrease the supply of  and carrier demand for  de installed equipment 
our sales of de installed equipment depend upon carrier utilization of existing telecommunications network technology 
if the lifecycle of equipment comprising carrier networks is significantly shortened for any reason  including technology advancements  the installed base of any particular model would be limited 
this limited installed base would reduce the supply of  and demand for  de installed equipment which could decrease our net revenue 
many of our customers are telecommunications carriers that may at any time reduce or discontinue their purchases of the equipment we sell to them 
if our customers choose to defer or curtail their capital spending programs  it could have a negative impact on our sales to those telecommunications carriers  which would harm our business 
a significant portion of our customers are emerging telecommunications carriers who compete against existing telephone companies 
these new participants only recently began to enter these markets  and many of these carriers are still building their networks and rolling out their services 
they require substantial capital for the development  construction and expansion of their networks and the introduction of their services 
if emerging carriers fail to acquire and retain customers or are unsuccessful in raising needed funds or responding to any other trends  such as price reductions for their services or diminished demand for telecommunications services in general  then they could be forced to reduce their capital spending programs 
if we fail to implement our strategy of purchasing equipment from and selling equipment to regional bell operating companies  our growth will suffer 
one of our strategies is to develop and expand our relationships with regional bell operating companies  or rbocs 
we believe the rbocs could provide us with a significant source of additional net revenue 
in addition  we believe the rbocs could provide us with a large supply of de installed equipment 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing this strategy 
rbocs may not choose to sell de installed equipment to us or may not elect to purchase this equipment from us 
rbocs may instead develop those capabilities internally or elect to compete with us and resell de installed equipment to our customers or prospective customers 
if we fail to successfully develop our relationships with rbocs or if rbocs elect to compete with us  our growth could suffer 
if we do not expand our international operations our growth could suffer 
we intend to continue expanding our business in international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop a successful international business  including sales  procurement and support channels 
following this strategy  we opened our european headquarters in the fourth quarter of however  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the equipment we sell  and therefore we might not be able to expand our international operations 
we currently have limited experience providing equipment outside the united states 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in we may fail to engage in selective acquisitions which could limit our future growth 
one of our strategies for growth is to engage in selective acquisitions 
our ability to conduct such acquisitions may be limited by our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates and obtain necessary financing 
in the event we are unable to identify and take advantage of these opportunities  we may experience difficulties in growing our business 
if we do engage in selective acquisitions  we may experience difficulty assimilating the operations or personnel of the acquired companies  which could threaten our future growth 
if we make acquisitions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel or integrating their operations  equipment or services into our organization 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could harm our results of operations 
since we began commercial operations in july  we have experienced rapid growth and expansion that is straining our resources 
in  the number of our full time employees increased from to continued growth could place a further strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
our inability to manage growth effectively could harm our business 
our current or planned operational systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
delays in the implementation of new systems or operational disruptions when we transition to new systems would impair our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our equipment inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
defects in the equipment we sell may seriously harm our credibility and our business 
telecommunications carriers require a strict level of quality and reliability from telecommunications equipment suppliers 
telecommunications equipment is inherently complex and can contain undetected software or hardware errors 
if we deliver telecommunications equipment with undetected material defects  our reputation  credibility and equipment sales could suffer 
moreover  because the equipment we sell is integrated into our customers networks  it can be difficult to identify the source of a problem should one occur 
the occurrence of such defects  errors or failures could also result in delays in installation  product returns  product liability and warranty claims and other losses to us or our customers 
in some of our contracts  we have agreed to indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from defects in the equipment we sell to them 
furthermore  we supply most of our customers with guarantees that cover the equipment we offer 
while we may carry insurance policies covering these possible liabilities  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim  whether successful or not  could be costly  damage our reputation and distract key personnel  any of which could harm our business 
our strategy to outsource services could impair our ability to deliver our equipment on a timely basis 
while we have expanded our service capability through the launching of somera onesource services in  we still currently depend  to a large degree  on third parties for a variety of equipment related services  including engineering  repair  transportation  testing  installation and de installation 
this outsourcing strategy involves risks to our business  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality and costs and the potential absence of adequate capacity 
in the event that any significant subcontractor were to become unable or unwilling to continue to perform their required services  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
this process could be lengthy  and we cannot be sure that additional sources of third party services would be available to us on a timely basis  or at all 
our quarterly net revenue and the price of our stock may be negatively impacted by the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers 
our quarterly net revenue may be subject to the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  which may occur as a result of our customers annual budgetary  procurement and sales cycles 
if our quarterly net revenue fails to meet the expectations of analysts due to those seasonal fluctuations  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
our ability to meet customer demand and the growth of our net revenue could be harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory needs accurately 
to meet customer demand in the future  we believe it is necessary to maintain or increase some levels of inventory 
failure to maintain adequate inventory levels in these products could hurt our ability to make sales to our customers 
in the past  we have experienced inventory shortfalls  and we cannot be certain that we will not experience shortfalls again in the future  which could harm our reputation and our business 
further  rapid technology advancement could make our existing inventory obsolete and cause us to incur losses 
in addition  if our forecasts lead to an accumulation of inventories that are not sold in a timely manner  our business could suffer 
the corruption or interruption of key software systems we use could cause our business to suffer if it delays or restricts our ability to meet our customers needs 
we rely on the integrity of key software and systems 
specifically we rely on our relationship management database which tracks information on currently or potentially available de installed equipment 
this software and these systems may be vulnerable to harmful applications  computer viruses and other forms of corruption and interruption 
in the event our software or systems are affected by any form of corruption or interruption  it could delay or restrict our ability to meet our customers needs  which could harm our reputation or business 
if we are unable to meet our additional capital needs in the future  we may not be able to execute our business growth strategy 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy these requirements 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to o take advantage of business opportunities  including more rapid international expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses  o develop and maintain higher inventory levels  o gain access to new product lines  o develop new services  or o respond to competitive pressures 
any additional financing we may need might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our business could suffer if the inability to raise this funding threatens our ability to execute our business growth strategy 
moreover  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced 
newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of investors in our common stock 
in addition  the terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
our facilities could be vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our main facilities are located on or near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if a disaster occurs  our ability to test and ship the equipment we sell would be seriously  if not completely  impaired  and our inventory could be damaged or destroyed  which would seriously harm our business 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions will be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us  and may make future business decisions with which some of our stockholders might disagree 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we have reviewed the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative commodity instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risks inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  all of our revenue and capital spending is denominated in us dollars 
we invest our excess cash in short term  interest bearing  investment grade marketable securities 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no long term debt outstanding
