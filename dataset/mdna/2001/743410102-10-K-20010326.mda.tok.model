the facilities that prologis develops are not always pre leased at the start of construction 
in addition  prologis may acquire facilities that are underleased at the time of acquisition 
while these situations will reduce prologis overall occupancy rate below its stabilized level in the short term  they do provide opportunities to increase revenues 
the term stabilized means that capital improvements  repositioning  new management and new marketing programs or development and marketing  in the case of newly developed facilities have been in effect for a sufficient period of time generally months to achieve stabilized occupancy typically  but ranging from to  depending on the submarket and product type 
prologis has been successful in increasing occupancies on acquired and developed facilities during their initial months of operation  resulting in an occupancy rate of and a leased rate of for stabilized facilities owned by prologis and its consolidated and unconsolidated entities as of december  the average increase in rental rates for both new and renewed leases on previously leased space million square feet for all facilities including those owned by prologis consolidated and unconsolidated entities during was

prologis customers are responsible for their direct utility bills and prologis facilities have minimal common utility charges  which are generally included in amounts recovered from customers under the terms of the lease agreements 
given the typical use of prologis distribution facilities bulk distribution and light manufacturing and assembly uses  prologis believes that its customers total utility expenses are a small portion of the total expenses related to the operations within prologis facilities

cdfs business income from prologis cdfs business segment consists primarily of i the profits from the disposition of land parcels and facilities that were developed by prologis or prologis development services and disposed of to customers or to entities in which prologis has an ownership interest  ii development fees earned by prologis development services  and iii income recognized under the equity method from prologis investment in the kingspark entities

this restriction applied to the kingspark entities 
on january   prologis acquired an ownership interest in the common stock of kingspark sa this transaction resulted in prologis having control of kingspark sa accordingly  prologis will consolidate the kingspark entities in its financial statements beginning in see new tax legislation and note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item temperature controlled distribution operations prologis recognizes income from the temperature controlled distribution operations segment of its business under the equity method

prologis recognizes of the net earnings of each entity 
prologis logistics acquired csi on april  and owned between and until june   at which time prologis logistics became csi s sole owner 
the increase in prologis share of prologis logistics net earnings from to and from to of million and million  respectively is primarily attributable to the increase in cubic feet capacity in operation 
see item business business strategy and operating segments temperature controlled distribution operations operations 
prologis invested in frigoscandia sa on january  frigoscandia s operating capacity was virtually constant in  and prologis share of frigoscandia sa s net losses includes net foreign currency exchange losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
excluding these foreign currency exchange losses  prologis recognized million less income under the equity method in than it recognized in from its investment in frigoscandia sa the increase in frigoscandia sa s net loss in from the loss recognized in is primarily due to i lower occupancy levels  principally the result of the reduction in inventories of beef and pork products by the german and french governments  ii a weak european vegetable harvest due to high rainfall levels during the summer months resulting in reduced inventories of frozen vegetables  and iii increases in fuel prices and expenses incurred related to trucker strikes in august and september 
in  frigoscandia sa s net loss was primarily the result of lower occupancy levels as compared to in  frigoscandia sa recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of million 
excluding the effect of this foreign currency exchange loss  prologis would have recognized income of million from its investment in frigoscandia sa in prologis believes that the factors that contributed to the decline in operating performance of frigoscandia are temporary and can be partially mitigated in the short term by reductions in general and administrative costs and other operating costs 
however  there is no assurance that these factors are temporary or that some or all of these factors will not continue past prologis and frigoscandia are currently monitoring the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in europe 
at this time  the effect positive or negative  if any  on the demand for temperature controlled distribution services and the related transportation services offered by frigoscandia cannot be determined 
other income and expense items interest income interest income was million in  an increase of million over the interest income recognized in interest income increased by million in over the increases in interest income are primarily the result of higher average cash balances 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expense in over is attributable to new business initiatives in both north america and europe 
the increase in general and administrative expense in over is primarily related to prologis expanded operational infrastructure in europe and also because prologis began expensing costs related to start up activities and organization costs under a new accounting pronouncement in see cumulative effect of accounting change 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  million in and million in the fluctuations in this expense between years is primarily attributable to the number of operating facilities directly owned by prologis and its consolidated entities in each year 
see property operations 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increases in each year are primarily the result of the increased use of debt to finance investment activities in each year  particularly in when prologis increased its secured debt balances to million as of december  of which million was assumed in the merger with meridian  see merger with meridian from million as of december  in addition  prologis issued senior unsecured notes in the amounts of million in april  million in october and million in july in conjunction with the merger with meridian  prologis also assumed million of senior unsecured notes 
interest expense recognized on borrowings is offset by interest capitalized with respect to prologis development activities 
capitalized interest increased by million to million in from million in and decreased by million to million in from million in capitalized interest levels are reflective of prologis cost of funds and the level of development activity in each year 
interest rate hedge expense see liquidity and capital resources derivative financial instruments for a discussion of this expense 
other expenses other expenses were million in  million in and million in included as other expenses are land holding costs  the write off of previously capitalized pursuit costs and costs associated with the name change to prologis in land holding costs were million in  million in and million in pursuit cost write offs were million in  million in and million in non recurring costs associated with the name change were million in gain on disposition of real estate gain on disposition of real estate represents the net gains from the disposition of operating facilities that were acquired or developed within the property operations segment 
generally  prologis disposes of facilities in the property operations segment because such facilities are considered to be non strategic facilities or to complement the portfolio of developed facilities that are acquired by entities in which prologis maintains an ownership interest 
non strategic facilities are assets located in markets or submarkets that are no longer considered target markets as well as assets that were acquired as part of previous portfolio acquisitions that are not consistent with prologis core portfolio based on the asset s size or configuration 
property operations segment dispositions were as follows million square feet  million of proceeds  net gains of million  excluding prologis california million square feet  million of proceeds  net gains of million  and million square feet  million of proceeds  net gains of million 
in august  in connection with the formation of prologis california  prologis disposed of operating facilities and two facilities under development to prologis california 
the net sales proceeds from this disposition were million and prologis recognized a gain of million on the transaction  which is net of million that was deferred because it did not qualify for income recognition due to prologis continuing ownership in prologis california 
prologis received an equity interest in prologis california of million and prologis california assumed million of prologis debt 
the remaining proceeds were received in cash 
foreign currency hedge income foreign currency hedge income of million recognized in resulted from the final settlement of two foreign currency hedge contracts related to the acquisition of frigoscandia in january the settlement of these contracts  which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  resulted in a total loss of million  including a mark to market loss of million recognized by prologis in foreign currency exchange gains losses prologis recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of million and million for and  respectively 
a net foreign currency exchange gain of million was recognized in foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement and settlement of intercompany debt and the remeasurement of third party debt of prologis foreign subsidiaries 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange gains and losses recognized in each period are a product of movements in certain foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro and the pound sterling and the level of intercompany and third party debt outstanding that is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
during and  the euro and pound sterling depreciated against the us dollar which is the primary cause of the remeasurement losses recognized in these years 
during  the currencies of prologis foreign subsidiaries  primarily the french franc and dutch guilder  strengthened against the u 
s 
dollar resulting in the net remeasurement gain that year 
prologis began utilizing foreign currency put options to hedge its foreign currency exchange risk in september see liquidity and capital resources derivative financial instruments 
income taxes prologis is taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes and is not required to pay federal income taxes if minimum distribution and income  asset and shareholder tests are met 
prologis development services is not a qualified reit subsidiary for tax purposes 
also  the foreign countries in which prologis operates do not recognize reits under their respective tax laws 
accordingly  prologis recognizes income taxes as appropriate and in accordance with gaap with respect to the taxable earnings of prologis development services and its foreign subsidiaries 
total income tax expense recognized in  and was million  million and million  respectively  of which the deferred component was million  zero and million in   and  respectively 
prologis deferred tax component of total income taxes is a function of each year s temporary differences items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for book purposes as well as the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance to adjust certain deferred tax assets primarily deferred tax assets created by tax net operating losses to their estimated realizable value 
in  the effect of the current year s temporary differences were entirely offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance resulting in no net deferred tax expense being recognized 
cumulative effect of accounting change through  prologis capitalized costs associated with start up activities and organization costs and amortized such costs over an appropriate period  generally five years 
statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that costs associated with organizational  pre opening  and start up activities be expensed as incurred  was adopted by prologis on january  accordingly  prologis expensed million of unamortized organization and start up costs as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of all such costs incurred since have been expensed see general and administrative

because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  annual distributions are expected to be consistently higher than annual earnings

the board set a projected annual distribution rate for of per common share 
prologis paid a distribution for the first quarter of of per common share on february  to holders of common shares as of february  the payment of distributions is subject to the discretion of the board and is dependent upon the financial condition and operating results of prologis and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year

however  transactions can continue to be denominated in the old national currencies 
after january   all transactions must be denominated in the euro 
the targeted exchange rates of the old national currencies to the euro were determined in may conversion to the euro has not had  nor is management aware of any future effects of the conversion to the euro that will have  a material impact on its business operations or results of operations 
new tax legislation due to the previous limitations in the code  certain of prologis taxable subsidiaries those entities whose operations generated income that was restricted under the reit rules were formed as entities in which prologis owned of the preferred stock and a third party owned of the voting common stock 
accordingly  prologis accounted for these types of investments prologis logistics  frigoscandia sa and kingspark sa under the equity method rather than consolidating the investments in its balance sheet and results of operations prologis development services is consolidated with prologis because prologis makes mortgage loans to prologis development services to fund its investment activities 
the rma  which was effective on january   modifies certain provisions of the code with respect to the taxation of reits 
primarily  the rma allows for the creation of taxable reit subsidiaries trs which will allow prologis and other reits to own up to of a trs previously limited to of the voting stock 
however  certain state law restrictions have prevented prologis from changing the ownership structures such that prologis owns of these entities 
see note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations funds from operations attributable to common shares increased million to million for from million for funds from operation attributable to common shares increased million from to funds from operations does not represent net income or cash from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  which is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in prologis consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of prologis operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  the funds from operations measure presented by prologis will not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
prologis considers funds from operations to be a useful supplemental measure of comparative period operating performance and as a supplemental measure to provide management  financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders with an indication of prologis ability to fund its capital expenditures and investment activities and to fund other cash needs 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit generally as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization  gains and losses from sales of properties  except those gains and losses from sales of properties upon completion or stabilization under pre sale agreements and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities to reflect their funds from operations on the same basis 
prologis includes gains and losses from the disposition of its cdfs business segment assets in funds from operations

risk factors risks factors include the occurrence of any of the events described below that could adversely affect prologis ability to achieve its projected returns on acquisitions and facilities under development and could hinder prologis ability to make expected distributions to equity holders 
prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions of the markets in which it owns property prologis operating performance depends on the economic conditions of markets in which its facilities are concentrated 
prologis operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for industrial distribution facilities  in prologis larger markets become less favorable relative to other geographic areas 
any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction of demand for distribution space could adversely effect prologis operating income and the value of its common shares 
prologis investments are subject to risks particular to real estate value of real estate dependent on numerous factors real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
real estate values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance  the ability of the owner to control variable operating costs  governmental regulations  interest rate levels  the availability of financing  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning  and other laws 
restrictions on  and risks of  unsuccessful development activities prologis intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise 
such development activities generally require various government and other approvals 
prologis may not receive such approvals 
prologis will be subject to risks associated with any such development activities 
these risks include the risk that development opportunities explored by prologis may be abandoned  the risk that construction costs of a facility may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated  limited cash flow during the construction period  and the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable 
in case of an unsuccessful development project  prologis loss could exceed its investment in the project 
tenant default prologis income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis tenants are unable to meet their obligations to prologis  or if prologis is unable to lease  on economically favorable terms  a significant amount of space in its industrial distribution facilities 
in the event of default by a significant number of tenants  prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlords 
real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets and therefore may tend to limit the ability of prologis to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the code  prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules  relating to the number of facilities disposed of in a year  their tax bases and the cost of improvements made to the facilities  or meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  prologis ability to sell assets  or contribute assets to entities in which prologis has an ownership interest  at any time to change its asset base may be restricted 
share prices may be affected by market interest rates the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate  which could adversely affect the market price of such common shares 
a decrease in the market price of the common shares could reduce prologis ability to raise additional equity capital in the public markets 
uninsured losses may adversely affect prologis some types of losses  such as from acts of war  may be uninsurable  or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs  prologis could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the affected facility  but would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage indebtedness on the facility 
potential environmental liability under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
the presence of such substances on prologis properties may adversely affect its ability to sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may also have an adverse affect on prologis ability to pay distributions to its shareholders 
debt financing  increases in interest rates  financial covenants and absence of limitations on debt may result in decreased distribution to shareholders debt financing prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that prologis cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and the risk that prologis will not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of such refinancings will not be as favorable as terms of the existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any indebtedness or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
requirements of credit facilities  foreclosures the terms of prologis indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios  maintaining insurance coverage  etc 
these covenants may limit prologis flexibility in its operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of cash available for distribution may be adversely affected 
no limitations on debt prologis currently has a policy of incurring debt only  if upon such incurrence  prologis debt to book capitalization ratio  as adjusted  would equal or less 
the board could alter or eliminate this policy without shareholder approval and would do so if  for example  it were necessary in order for prologis to continue to qualify as a reit under the code 
if this policy were changed  prologis could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to shareholders 
failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect shareholders prologis has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december  to maintain reit status  prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis 
those requirements seek to ensure  among other things  that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related  that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit s ownership is not overly concentrated 
due to the complex nature of these rules  the limited available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules  the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law  administrative interpretations of the law and developments at prologis  no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year 
if prologis fails to qualify as a reit  it will be taxed as a regular corporation  and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis taxable income 
the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce the funds available for distribution to prologis shareholders or for reinvestment 
in the absence of reit status  distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 
moreover  prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if prologis later requalified as a reit  it might be required to pay a full corporate level tax on any unrealized gain in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of non reit status 
potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code  prologis must annually distribute to prologis shareholders at least of its ordinary taxable income  excluding net capital gains changed to as a result of the rma see new tax legislation 
this requirement limits prologis ability to accumulate capital 
prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements 
difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements  because income may have to be reported before cash is received  because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited 
in those situations  prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell facilities on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements 
if prologis fails to make a required distribution  it would cease to be a reit 
currency risk prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
for example  a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currencies of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis performance 
prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects through the use of foreign currency put option contracts  although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful 
influence of prologis principal shareholder may impact prologis management and operations prologis and security capital are parties to a third amended and restated investor agreement  dated as of september  pursuant to the investor agreement  security capital has the right  so long as it owns between and of the common shares  to nominate one person to the board 
so long as security capital owns or more of the common shares  security capital will be entitled to nominate a proportionate number of persons to the board subject to a maximum of three nominees if the size of the board does not increase above the current size of ten trustees 
under the investor agreement  so long as it owns at least of the common shares  security capital also has the right of prior approval with respect to the following matters the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  other than issuances in connection with option  dividend reinvestment and similar plans  for less than the fair market value of such securities  the issuance of any preferred shares which would result in the fixed charge coverage ratio being less than to  adopting any employee benefit plans under which common shares may be issued  the compensation of senior officers of prologis  and the incurrence of additional indebtedness which would result in the interest expense coverage ratio being less than to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk prologis is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
on a limited basis  prologis uses certain derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce its market risk 
prologis does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with board approved policies 
prologis has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
prologis has defined its market risk exposure as the potential loss in future earnings and cash flow with respect to interest rate exposure and future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure of its market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  prologis ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time  and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk prologis interest rate risk is related primarily to its variable rate credit facilities 
prologis interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve its objective  prologis primarily borrows on a fixed rate basis 
therefore  prologis primary interest rate risk is created by its variable rate unsecured lines of credit and its variable rate short term borrowing arrangements  if any 
although prologis has no interest rate derivatives outstanding as of december   prologis has in the past and may in the future  utilize derivative instruments as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage its interest rate exposure 
during the year ended december   prologis had weighted average outstanding borrowings of million on its variable rate unsecured lines of credit 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for interest rate related financial instruments was approximately million on both future earnings and cash flow as of december  the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for and assumed a flat yield curve 
foreign currency risk prologis uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest expense from foreign entities 
in addition  prologis incurs foreign currency risk related to its us dollar denominated loans to its foreign consolidated subsidiaries 
the remeasurement of intercompany loans results in foreign currency exchange gains or losses that are recognized by prologis 
however  prologis does not incur an actual cash gain or loss until the loans are repaid 
prologis exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro  british pound sterling  french franc and swedish krona 
prologis foreign currency exchange sensitivity analysis included foreign currency put option contracts affected by foreign currency exchange risk  as well as us dollar denominated loans to foreign consolidated entities 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the estimated year end market risk exposure to future earnings was million 
the sensitivity analysis excluded the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the underlying projected net operating income  which has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it 
however  since prologis hedges approximately of its projected net operating income from foreign entities  approximately of the impact to total net operating income from its foreign entities of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments
