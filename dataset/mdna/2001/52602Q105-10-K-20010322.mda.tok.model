item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lendingtree  inc the company or lendingtree was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  and commenced nationwide operations on july  in august  the company acquired certain assets principally a nationwide network of real estate agents and assumed certain liabilities of homespace services  inc lendingtree offers an internet based loan marketplace for consumers and lenders 
the company attracts consumer demand to the marketplace through its proprietary website www 
lendingtree 
com as well as through private label and co branded marketplaces enabled by its technology platform  lend x sm 
in addition  through its website the company provides access to other services related to owning  maintaining or buying and selling a home  including a network of real estate brokers 
consumers begin the lendingtree process by completing a simple on line credit request referred to as a qualification form 
data from the qualification form along with a credit score calculated from credit reports retrieved by a credit scoring firm is compared to the underwriting criteria of more than participating lenders in the company s lender network 
consumers can receive multiple loan offers in response to a single credit request and then compare  review  and accept the offer that best suits their needs 
lenders can generate new business that meets their specific underwriting criteria at a substantially lower cost of acquisition than traditional marketing channels 
the company s marketplace encompasses most consumer credit categories  including mortgages  home equity loans  automobile loans  credit cards  and personal loans 
the company is not a lender 
rather  it is a loan marketplace that seeks to drive efficiency and cost savings in the consumer credit markets for both consumers and lenders 
the company earns revenue from lenders that pay fees for every qualification form that meets their underwriting criteria and is transmitted to them transmission fees and for loans that they close closed loan fees 
the company s website is powered by its loan marketplace technology platform  lend x 
the company also licenses and or hosts its lend x technology for use by other businesses  enabling them to create their own customized co branded or private label lending exchanges 
through these lend x partnerships  the company can earn revenue both from technology fees related to customization  licensing and hosting the third party exchange  as well as fees from network sources transmission fees and closed loan fees 
compared to revenue total revenue was approximately million in  an increase of million from million in network the company s network revenue was approximately million  or of total revenue for  compared with million  or of total revenue for this dollar growth reflects a substantial increase in volume of qualification forms the company transmitted to its lenders and a significant increase in the amount of revenue earned from closed loan fees 
the company attributes the increase in transmission volume from approximately  discrete transmitted qualification forms in to approximately  in primarily to its extensive advertising campaign in although advertising expense was reduced in the second half of compared to the first half of  the company attributes increased brand awareness and a significant increase in website traffic year over year to the effectiveness of the increased advertising spending 
the increase in closed loan fees reflects not only the increased transmission volume  but also to an increase in the number and variety of lenders on the company s network 
added lenders create additional opportunities for consumer s credit requests to be transmitted for evaluation and or closure by a lender  thereby creating revenue for the company 
closed loans increased from  in to approximately  in additional network revenue is derived from credit requests that are received through private label or co branded websites of other businesses lend x partners that are enabled by the company s lend x technology 
if these qualification forms are successfully transmitted to and or fulfilled by one of the company s network lenders  the company earns transmission fees and closed loan fees  if applicable  from that lender 
for  the company recorded million of lend x related network revenue  compared to none in lend x technology lend x technology revenue totaled million  or approximately of total revenue for  compared with 
million  or approximately of total revenue for the increase in lend x technology revenue is principally the result of a significant new customization  implementation and licensing contract that was entered into in the second quarter of lend x technology revenue recognized during the under this contract reflects the company s progress towards completion 
for  this single customer accounted for million  or of the total lend x technology revenue 
gross profit and cost of revenue gross profit of million of total revenue for was million higher than that had gross profit of million of total revenue 
these improvements in gross margin and gross margin percentage are due to the substantial increase in network revenue  as noted above  without similar  proportionate increases in network costs of revenue 
total cost of revenue increased million to million in from million in  principally due to increases in variable network costs of revenue 
the most significant portions of the company s costs of revenue are volume based 
costs such as credit scoring fees  consumer rebates  network hosting expenses and direct costs to lend x partners tend to increase as volume and revenue increase 
network for  variable network costs of revenue were million or approximately million higher than the same period in in  variable network cost of revenue included million for direct consumer promotion costs associated with consumers that requested and qualified for rebates 
these promotional costs were 
million in the same period of during  the most significant direct consumer promotion cost was associated with consumers that requested and qualified for a credit card through the network and also closed a loan through the company s network of lenders 
other variable network costs related to credit scoring  network hosting and lend x partners increased million  million and 
million  respectively  due to increases in customer volume 
costs of revenue that are not directly volume based  principally personnel costs  increased approximately million to million in reflecting increased staff in the company s implementation and customer care departments 
lend x technology costs of revenue associated with lend x technology are principally employment and consultant costs related to projects to customize and or implement lend x for partners as well as ongoing server costs related to hosting lend x for these partners 
due to the company entering several more lend x technology arrangements in  these types of costs were a million higher in at million compared to 
million 
operating expenses product development expense was approximately million for and million for the same period of the increase over the prior year is principally related to increased personnel costs 
product development costs represent costs incurred related to the ongoing efforts to enhance and maintain the functionality of the company s lend x technology and its website 
marketing and advertising expenses increased million to approximately million for compared to million for this increase is primarily due to substantially higher advertising expenses in incurred in an effort to build and maintain the company s brand awareness and attract users to the company s website 
during  the company ran a national network and cable television advertising campaign and expanded its radio and outdoor advertising campaigns to significantly more markets than it did during the company currently anticipates that marketing and advertising will continue to be its most significant expense  as it will continue to run promotional campaigns and maintain awareness for both its lendingtree and lend x brands 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million in  an increase of million 
approximately million of this increase is due to higher employee compensation related costs due to significant growth in the business 
another million of the increase relates to employee related costs such as travel  relocation and recruiting fees 
professional and consulting fees increased million from to reflecting increased professional development  technology consulting costs  public relations and increased professional fees related to regulatory and intellectual property matters 
the company also incurred million in higher facilities  telephone  utilities related expenses due primarily to a larger facility and employee growth in the amortization of the excess purchase price related to the homespace acquisition contributed million of the increase 
bad debt expense increased 
million from depreciation expenses increased 
million from to reflecting new equipment and software purchased in the company does not expect sales  general and administrative spending to continue to grow at these rates in the foreseeable future 
included in the company s operating expenses for is amortization of deferred non cash compensation charges of million 
as of december   the company s balance sheet reflected deferred non cash compensation charges of million related to certain stock option and warrant grants that were considered compensatory 
the deferred charge related to stock options million is being amortized over the four year vesting period associated with the related options  ending principally in the third quarter of and the first quarter of the deferred charge related to warrants 
million is being amortized through january  corresponding to the initial term of the underlying service agreement 
loss on impaired investment in february  the company made a million equity investment in a company providing mortgage marketplace services over the internet 
the company s minority investment represents approximately of the outstanding equity of that business and accordingly  it is accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
in december  management determined that the carrying value of this investment was impaired as a result of a series of historical and forecasted operating losses and the prospect that the investment might be unable to fund its operations in the future 
as a result of this impairment  management wrote the investment down to its estimated fair value of 
million  recording million as a non operating loss on impaired investment 
interest income interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased to million in from 
million in this increase was primarily due to higher average cash  short term investment and restricted investment balances in as a result of the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in february and the net proceeds from a private offering of preferred stock in september compared to revenue total revenue amounted to million in  an increase of million from million in network network revenue accounted for million  or of total revenue for  compared with for network revenue in increased by million from million in primarily due to higher qualification form and closed loan volume 
transmitted qualification form volume increased over nine times from approximately  to approximately  during this period while the number of loans closed increased nearly forty times from about to over  lend x technology lend x technology revenue accounted for million  or of total revenue for  compared with million for the increase in lend x and other technology revenue resulted primarily from the sale of more lend x licenses 
cost of revenue cost of network revenue increased to million for up from million for this increase in cost was due to volume related expenses such as credit scoring and network hardware expense and from an increase in employment in the borrower relations department 
the company s gross margin increased to from for and  respectively 
lend x technology 
cost of lend x increased to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to greater direct hours incurred for lend x projects 
operating expenses product development expense was million for and marketing and advertising expense increased to million for from million for  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily due to higher advertising expenses in order to build brand awareness and increase volume to our marketplace 
sales  general and administrative expense increased to million for  an increase of million from the increase is primarily due to higher employee related costs such as compensation  recruiting and relocation expenses  rent for a larger facility  and professional fees 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company required million of cash to fund operations  such amounts were expended primarily for advertising  expansion of the infrastructure and support personnel  and working capital needs 
since inception  the company has incurred significant losses and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  these uses of cash  losses and accumulated deficit have resulted from the significant costs incurred for advertising and marketing efforts to build and maintain brand awareness 
additionally  significant costs have been incurred for employment expenses related to the establishing relationships with lenders  real estate brokers and other business partners and the development of lend x as well as for other general corporate purposes 
because the company plans to continue to invest in these items  the company anticipates that it will continue to incur losses and experience negative cash flow from operations throughout as of december   the company had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
of this amount  million was restricted under an escrow arrangement with the company s advertising agency 
as more fully described in the company s notes to its financial statements included herein  subsequent to  the company signed definitive documents for the following financing transactions the sale of million series a convertible preferred shares of stock for million excluding  shares sold to the company s chief executive officer  funded by a loan from the company for  and excluding approximately million shares of series a convertible preferred issued to capital z in exchange for the equity rights certificate issued to them on september   for which the company received million 
a two year  million secured revolving line of credit with the union labor life insurance company ullico 
amounts outstanding under the ullico line of credit bear interest at a rate of payable in cash and an additional amount payable in warrants interest warrants as more fully described in the notes to the company s financial statements 
ullico 
a month facility to provide a million revolving loan with the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac 
amounts outstanding under the freddie mac facility bear interest at a rate of payable in cash and an additional amount payable in warrants interest warrants as more fully described in the notes to the company s financial statements 
a million equity line whereby the company may  at its discretion sell shares of its common stock to an investor from time to time subject to maximum sale limitations in any one monthly period  for up to a total of million over months 
with respect to the shares to be sold under this arrangement  in addition to other requirements  the company must file a registration statement and have it declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec before it can sell such shares to the investor in this arrangement 
while the number of interest warrants to be issued under the million revolving line of credit and the million revolving loan will be determined as described in the notes to the company s financial statements  the actual amount of interest expense will be based on the fair value of these securities on the date that they are issued 
accordingly  for every interest warrant issued  each dollar that the price of the company s common stock on each warrant issuance date exceeds will increase the actual interest expense recorded by the company by approximately one dollar 
management believes that the existing cash and cash equivalents  the proceeds from the series a preferred stock sales noted above  the availability of the revolving credit facilities noted above and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operating and capital needs through although the company has historically experienced significant revenue growth and plans to reduce negative cash flows from operations  the operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that revenue growth will continue or that the company will be able to achieve or sustain profitability 
hence  the company s liquidity could be significantly affected 
however  if revenue does not grow as anticipated or if the company is unable to successfully raise sufficient additional funds through the million equity line referred to above  or in another manner  management would reduce discretionary operating expenditures  including advertising and marketing and certain administrative and overhead costs 
the company believes that available cash will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditures through  after which management believes the company will become cash flow positive 
failure to generate sufficient revenue or to reduce costs as necessary could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue as a going concern and achieve its business objectives 
additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  such financing may not be on terms favorable to the company 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the company s shareholders may experience significant dilution 
for the first two months of  the company s operating results have been substantially better than the comparable period in and better than the company s internal budgets 
management believes the company s operating results for will significantly improve over as a result of the following factors continued improvements in the level of costs necessary to attract consumers to the company s services 
specifically  the company plans to capitalize on the high level of brand awareness it has achieved among consumers and has developed its marketing and advertising strategy to utilize a mix of both offline and online mediums proven to be most efficient for our marketplace model 
this strategy will significantly reduce the average amount expended per revenue generating consumer 
during the first half of  the company s advertising spending was directed towards building brand awareness and included broad national television and radio campaigns 
during  with a high level of brand awareness established  the company is positioned to spend advertising dollars more efficiently through the use of cable television  network and spot radio 
the company s use of second advertising spots in place of certain second spots has also demonstrated improved efficiencies 
the company believes that increased demand for its services experienced during the first two months of resulting  in part  from reductions in interest rates will continue for several additional months into the company also believes that is has the current infrastructure and staff to support the forecasted growth for during the first two months of the company has experienced increased revenue over the same period in and anticipates that it will see improvements in the rates which it is able to transmit qualification forms to lenders due to additional lenders joining the company s network during and additional lenders on the network provide more coverage for different types of consumer credit needs 
added lenders create additional opportunities for consumer s credit requests to be transmitted for evaluation by a lender  thereby creating revenue for the company 
additional revenue from lend x technology sales through relationships with key companies in the mortgage industry  including the federal home loan mortgage corporation and bank of america  which are recent lend x customers 
improved realization of revenue from the now fully integrated real estate services product 
in late  the company began offering consumers that complete a qualification form on its website the opportunity to obtain a real estate agent from a national network of real estate agents 
additionally  in early  the company has begun to advertise its real estate services with two affinity membership clubs 
substantially all of the company s assets are pledged under the above revolving credit arrangements and existing capital lease obligations 
a covenant in one of the company s capital lease agreement s requires that the company maintain a cash balance of not less than million throughout the term of the lease 
if the company s cash balance falls below million at the end of a period  the company will be required to collateralize the balance of the lease with cash 
on september  the company received million from capital z  its largest investor in exchange for an equity rights certificate  initially exercisable for  million shares of the company s common stock 
this transaction is more fully described in the notes to the financial statements  incorporated by reference herein 
in connection with the series a convertible preferred stock sale described above  capital z exercised the equity rights certificate for million shares of the company s series a convertible preferred stock 
on february   the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock at an initial public offering price of per share  raising approximately million net of offering costs  underwriting discounts and commissions 
prior to its initial public offering  the company had financed its operations primarily through private placements of securities  raising over million  net of offering costs 
restricted cash at december  of million includes investments that are maintained in an escrow account 
this escrow account was established by the company and its advertising agency to maintain funds set aside by the company for non cancelable and approved expenditures and services of the advertising agency 
disbursements from the escrow account can only be made for advertising expenditures the company has approved in advance 
on august   the company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of homespace 
the consideration paid for the acquired assets consisted of million in cash and  shares of the company s restricted common stock 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded from the company s short term investments that the company had invested in with proceeds from its february initial public offering of common stock 
factors that may affect future results of operations in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating the company 
the company s limited operating history makes the company s business and prospects difficult to evaluate 
the company has a limited operating history 
the company was formed in and began serving consumers across the united states in july there is no significant historical basis to assess how the company will respond to competitive  economic or technological challenges 
the company s business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies like lendingtree  inc which operate in new and rapidly developing online marketplaces 
the company s failure to address these risks and uncertainties could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has a history of losses and expects losses in the future 
the company has never been profitable 
the company incurred losses from operations of approximately million in as of december   the company had an accumulated net deficit of approximately million 
the company anticipates that its future expense levels will continue to exceed future revenue based on the company s operating plans for the company may find it necessary to accelerate expenditures relating to the company s sales and marketing efforts or otherwise increase the company s financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand awareness among consumers and lenders 
if the company s revenue grows at a slower rate than the company anticipates  or if the company s spending levels exceed the company s expectations or cannot be adjusted to reflect slower revenue growth  the company may not achieve or sustain profitability 
the company s business model is unproven and could fail 
the company s business model and profit potential are unproven and no assurances can be made that it will be able to become profitable 
to achieve profitability in the company s marketplace segment the company s revenue per consumer must exceed the costs of attracting a consumer to the company s website 
to date  this has not been the case 
the company s revenue model depends heavily on revenue generated from lenders participating in the company s network who pay the company fees based upon their receipt of credit requests referred to as transmission fees and fees based upon loan closings referred to as closed loan fees 
the company also licenses its lend x technology to other companies who can create single and multi lender online marketplaces 
to become profitable  the company must rapidly achieve broad market acceptance of our service by both lenders and consumers who have traditionally used other means to lend and borrow money 
in addition  the company must attract a sufficient number of consumers with credit profiles targeted by its lenders and the revenue per consumer must exceed the cost of attracting such consumer 
it is possible that the company s online loan marketplace model will not gain the widespread acceptance necessary to support the company s business  in which case the company may find it necessary to alter its business model 
the company cannot accurately predict what  if any  changes it would make to its business model in response to the uncertainties in the online lending market 
these changes might include shifting all or a portion of the company s fees to consumers or reducing fees currently charged to lenders to expand volume more quickly 
shifting fees to consumers may not be feasible  as other companies may be able to offer comparable services with no fees 
the company s operating results may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
during  revenue earned from mortgages  traditionally a market segment that is greatly impacted by changes in interest rates  represented approximately of the company s total revenue 
while interest rates during this period were rising  the company s business continued to show increases in website traffic  transmitted qualification forms for mortgages and revenue from closed loan fees for mortgages in however  during future periods of rising interest rates the company may experience a decline in consumer traffic to the company s website and during periods of robust credit demand  typically associated with falling interest rates  lenders may have less incentive to use the company s marketplace 
either of these events could reduce the company s revenue and the company cannot assess the effects of interest rates on the company s business over a broad range of interest rate environments 
the company s quarterly operating results are not an indication of the company s future results 
the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors that affect the company s revenue or expenses in any particular quarter 
the company s quarterly results will fluctuate in part based on the demand for and supply of consumer loans which are a function of seasonal and other fluctuations in interest rates and related economic factors  all of which are outside of the company s control 
these temporary fluctuations could adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  the company plans to continue to increase its operating expenses significantly to expand the company s sales and marketing  administration  maintenance and technical support and product management groups 
if revenue falls below the company s expectations in any quarter and the company is unable to quickly reduce the company s spending in response  the company s operating results would be lower than expected 
in addition  the company expects that as its business matures it will experience seasonal fluctuations in its operating results due to fluctuations in consumer credit markets during the year 
for example  home buying behavior is seasonal 
typically there are a greater number of mortgage closings in the second and third quarters of a year as compared to the first and fourth quarters 
because of the company s limited operating history  it has not been possible for the company to assess the impact of seasonal effects on its business 
our future success is dependent upon increased acceptance of the internet by consumers and lenders as a medium for lending 
if consumer and lender acceptance of our online marketplace does not increase  our business will not succeed and the value of your investment may be adversely affected 
the online lending market is new and rapidly developing 
the adoption of online lending in general  and our marketplace in particular  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information  and applying for credit by consumers as well as acceptance by lenders that have historically relied upon traditional lending methods 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively with traditional borrowing and lending methods 
if the company is unable to maintain the company s brand recognition  consumer and lender demand for the company s service will be limited 
if the company fails to promote and maintain its brand successfully or incurs significant expenses in promoting its brand and fails to generate a corresponding increase in revenue as a result of its branding efforts  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes it has successfully built a recognizable brand 
however  continuing to build brand awareness of the lendingtree marketplace is critical to achieving increased demand for the company s service 
brand recognition is a key differentiating factor among providers of online lending services  and the company believes it will be increasingly important as competition intensifies 
in order to maintain the company s brand awareness  the company must succeed in its marketing efforts  provide high quality service and increase the number of consumers using its marketplace 
if visitors to the company s website do not perceive the company s existing services to be of high quality or if the company alters or modifies its existing services  introduces new services  or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received  the value of the company s brand could be diluted  which could decrease the attractiveness of the company s service to consumers and lenders 
lenders in the company s network are not precluded from offering consumer credit products outside the company s marketplace 
if a significant number of potential consumers are able to obtain loans from the company s participating lenders without utilizing the company s service  the company s ability to generate revenue may be limited 
because the company does not have exclusive relationships with the lenders whose loan products are offered on its online marketplace  consumers may obtain offers and loans from these lenders without using the company s service 
the company s lenders can offer their products directly to consumers through brokers  mass marketing campaigns  or through other traditional methods of credit distribution 
these lenders can also offer their products over the internet  either directly to prospective borrowers  through one or more of the company s online competitors  or both 
if the company s participating lenders do not provide competitive levels of service to consumers  the company s brand will be harmed and the company s ability to attract consumers to the company s website may be affected 
the company s ability to provide a high quality borrowing experience depends in part on consumers receiving competitive levels of convenience  customer service  pricing terms and responsiveness from the company s participating lenders 
if the company s participating lenders do not provide consumers with competitive levels of convenience  customer service  price and responsiveness the value of the company s brand may be harmed and the number of consumers using the company s service may decline 
we cannot assure you that any future acquisitions will be successful 
our future results of operations may be dependent  in part  upon the ability of our management to assimilate the operations of any future acquisitions and to oversee these expanded operations 
our ability to manage any future acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors  including our capital resources  our ability to retain key employees and our ability to control operating and production costs 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts or that these efforts may not in certain circumstances adversely affect our operating results 
the company may experience reduced visitor traffic  reduced revenue and harm to the company s reputation in the event of unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures 
any significant failure to maintain the satisfactory performance  reliability  security and availability of the company s website  filtering systems or network infrastructure may cause significant harm to the company s reputation  its ability to attract and maintain a high volume of visitors to its website  and to attract and retain participating consumers and lenders 
the company s revenue depends in large part on the number of credit requests submitted by consumers 
any system interruptions that result in the inability of consumers to submit these credit requests  or more generally the unavailability of the company s service offerings  could have an adverse impact on the company s revenue 
in addition  the company believes that consumers who have a negative experience with the company s website may be reluctant to return or recommend lendingtree to other potential consumers 
in the past  the company s website has experienced outages and decreased performance 
in the worst such instance to date  the company experienced a service outage for a period of approximately nine hours due to a database software failure 
if similar outages occur in the future  they may severely harm the company s reputation and the company s ability to offer the company s service 
the company leases computer hardware through a service provider located in beltsville  maryland 
a full backup system is located in cupertino  california 
if both of these locations experienced a system failure  the performance of the company s website would be harmed 
these systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
the company s insurance policies may not compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in the company s systems 
any extended period of disruptions could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
failure to comply with laws governing the company s service or material changes in the regulatory environment relating to the internet could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the loan products and real estate agent referral services available through the company s website are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state governmental authorities 
because of uncertainties as to the applicability of some of these laws and regulations to the internet and  more specifically  to the company s business  and considering its business has evolved and expanded in a relatively short period of time  the company may not always have been  and may not always be  in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal and state regulatory authorities may result in  among other things  revocation of required licenses or registrations  loss of approved status  termination of contracts without compensation  loss of exempt status  indemnification liability to lenders and others doing business with us  administrative enforcement actions and fines  class action lawsuits  cease and desist orders  and civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could materially affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
many  but not all  states require licenses to solicit or broker to residents of those states  loans secured by residential mortgages  and other consumer loans  including credit card  automobile and personal loans 
the company is not currently licensed and able to accept credit requests for all loan products in every state 
the company is not currently accepting credit requests for loan products from residents of states in which we are not licensed to provide those products 
in many of the states in which the company is licensed  it is subject to examination by regulators 
in addition  as a result of the homespace transaction  the company is required to obtain real estate broker licenses  additional mortgage broker licenses and individual call center personnel licenses in numerous states 
failure to obtain these licenses and approvals could prevent the company from receiving fees from the real estate agent referral and mortgage services programs it offers and may subject the company to the types of fines  forfeitures and litigation discussed above 
as a computer loan origination system or mortgage broker conducting business through the internet  the company faces an additional level of regulatory risk given that most of the laws governing lending transactions have not been substantially revised or updated to fully accommodate electronic commerce 
until these laws  rules and regulations are revised to clarify their applicability to transactions conducted through electronic commerce  any company providing loan related services through the internet or other means of electronic commerce will face compliance uncertainty 
federal law  for example  generally prohibits the payment or receipt of referral fees in connection with residential mortgage loan transactions 
the applicability of referral fee prohibitions to the advertising  marketing  distribution and cyberspace rental arrangements used by online companies like lendingtree may have the effect of reducing the types and amounts of fees that the company may charge or pay in connection with real estate secured products 
regulations promulgated by some states may impose compliance obligations on any person who acquires or more of the company s common stock  including requiring that person to periodically file financial and other personal and business information 
if any person acquires or more of the company s common stock and refuses or fails to comply with these requirements  the company may not be able to obtain a license and existing licensing arrangements in particular states may be jeopardized 
the inability to obtain  or the loss of  required licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the parties conducting business with the company  such as lenders and affiliated websites  may similarly be subject to federal and state regulation 
these parties act as independent contractors and not as our agents in their solicitations and transactions with consumers 
consequently  the company cannot ensure that these entities will comply with applicable laws and regulations at all times 
failure on the part of a lender or an affiliated website to comply with these laws or regulations could result in  among other things  claims of vicarious liability or a negative impact on the company s reputation 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
as an online loan marketplace the company may be liable as a result of information retrieved from its website or the websites of businesses with which the company maintains relationships 
the company may be subject to legal claims relating to information that is published or made available on its website and the other websites linked to it 
the company s service may subject us to potential liabilities or claims resulting from lost or misdirected messages from our network lenders  consumers or vendors  illegal or fraudulent use of e mail  or interruptions or delays in transmission of qualification forms or lenders offers 
in addition  the company could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims  even if the company ultimately is not found liable 
if any of these events occur  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
the company may be limited or restricted in the way the company establishes and maintains the company s online relationships by laws generally applicable to the company s business 
the real estate settlement procedures act respa and related regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of a real estate secured loan to a loan broker or lender 
the act and the related regulations also prohibit fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services  including mortgage brokerage or lending services 
notwithstanding these prohibitions  respa permits payments for goods or facilities furnished or for services actually performed  so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods  facilities  or services provided 
failure to comply with respa may result in  among other things  administrative enforcement actions  class action lawsuits  and cease and desist orders and civil and criminal liability 
the mortgage and home equity products offered through the company s marketplace are residential real estate secured loans subject to these provisions of respa 
consequently  the company s online relationships with lenders and other internet companies and websites that offer these products are subject to respa s prohibitions on payment or receipt of fees for referrals and for unearned fees 
the company believes that it has structured these relationships to comply with these regulations 
the applicability of respa s compensation provisions to these types of internet based relationships  however  is unclear and the appropriate regulatory agency has provided limited guidance to date on the subject 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property rights could harm its brand building efforts and ability to compete effectively 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property could harm its brand and reputation  devalue its content in the eyes of its customers  and adversely affect its ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing or defending the company s intellectual property rights  including our service marks  patent application  copyrights and trade secrets  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
we regard our intellectual property as critical to the company s success 
to protect the rights to the company s intellectual property  it relies on a combination of patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements  and other contractual arrangements with its employees  affiliates  clients  and others 
the protective steps the company has taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information 
the company may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights 
the company has applied for a us patent and filed a patent cooperation treaty international patent application on its lend x technology and its online loan market process 
while the number of software and business method patents issued by the us patent and trademark office has been growing substantially in recent years  there is still a significant degree of uncertainty associated with these patents 
it is possible that the company s patent applications will be denied or granted in a very limited manner such that they offer little or no basis for us to deter competitors from employing similar technology or processes or allow the company to defend against third party claims of patent infringement 
breaches of the company s network security could subject the company to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
any penetration of the company s network security or other misappropriation of its users personal information could cause interruptions in its operations and subject the company to liability 
claims against the company could also be based on other misuses of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
these claims could result in litigation and financial liability 
security breaches could also damage the company s reputation 
the company relies on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information 
it is possible that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries  or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that the company uses to protect consumer transaction data 
the company cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent security breaches 
the company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences 
regulation of the internet is unsettled  and future regulations could inhibit the growth of the internet  decrease visitors to the company s website and otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business 
existing laws and regulations specifically regulate communications and commerce on the internet 
further laws and regulations that address issues such as user privacy  pricing  online content regulation  taxation  and the characteristics and quality of online products and services are under consideration by federal  state  local  and foreign governments and agencies 
several telecommunications companies have petitioned the federal communications commission to regulate internet service providers and online service providers in a manner similar to the regulation of long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on such companies 
this regulation  if imposed  could increase the cost of transmitting data over the internet 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement and personal privacy are applicable to the internet 
many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
the federal trade commission and government agencies in certain states have been investigating internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
the company could incur additional expenses if any new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these agencies choose to investigate the company s privacy practices 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet  or new application or interpretation of existing laws  could inhibit the growth of the internet as a medium for commerce or credit procurement which could  in turn  decrease the demand for the company s service or otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company business could suffer if it loses the services of key executives if the company loses the services of douglas lebda  its founder  chief executive officer  and a director  or any of its other executive officers or key employees  the company s ability to expand its business would be seriously compromised 
mr 
lebda has been instrumental in determining the company s strategic direction and focus and in promoting the concept of an internet based loan marketplace for consumers and lenders 
the company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key executives 
our agreement with paul revere  which provides us with a million equity line  may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
the resale by paul revere of the common stock that it purchases from us will increase the number of our publicly traded shares  which could depress the market price of our common stock 
if we were to require paul revere to purchase our common stock at a time when our stock price is depressed  our existing common stockholders will experience substantial dilution 
moreover  as all the shares we sell to paul revere will be available for immediate resale  the mere prospect of our sales to it could depress the market price for our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could reduce the value of your investment 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock 
a substantial number of our outstanding shares of common stock will become eligible for resale in the public market within one year 
as of february   we had  common shares issued and outstanding 
in addition   stock options and  warrants were outstanding as of february  moreover  we may issue additional shares in acquisitions and may grant additional stock options to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under our stock option plan 
any substantial sales of such shares  including shares to be registered for resale under the financing transactions discussed in item or shares held by our principal investors  officers  directors  homespace services  inc or other affiliates  may cause our stock price to decline 
if our common stock price continues to drop or if nasdaq determines that our agreement with paul revere raises public interest concerns  we may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could eliminate the trading market for our common stock 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market 
in order to continue to be included in the nasdaq national market  a company must meet certain maintenance criteria 
the maintenance criteria applicable to us requires a minimum bid price of per share   in net tangible assets and  market value of the public float 
the public float excludes shares held directly or indirectly by any officer or director of our company 
as of december   we had approximately million of net tangible assets 
the market value of our public float at february  was approximately million and the lowest bid price of our common stock since february  was 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet these listing criteria 
the issuance by us of shares of common stock to paul revere  or the subsequent resale by paul revere of those shares  in either case at a discount to the market price  may reduce the trading price of our common stock to a level below the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement 
failure to meet these maintenance criteria may result in the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock is delisted and in order to have our common stock relisted on the nasdaq national market  we would be required to meet the criteria for initial listing  which are more stringent than the maintenance criteria 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that if we were delisted  we would be able to have our common stock relisted on the nasdaq national market 
in addition  nasdaq could delist our common stock if it determines that our agreement with paul revere raises public interest concerns 
in making such a determination  nasdaq would consider  among other things the business purpose of the transaction  the amount to be raised from paul revere relative to our existing capital structure  the dilutive effect of the transaction on our existing stockholders  the risks undertaken by paul revere  the relationship between paul revere and us  whether the transaction with paul revere was preceded by other similar transactions  and whether the transaction with paul revere is consistent with just and equitable principles of trade 
if our common stock were delisted from the nasdaq national market  we would not be able to draw down any additional funds on the equity line 
finally  if our common stock is removed from listing on the nasdaq national market  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could reduce the value of your investment

the task force determined that a software element covered by sop is only present in a hosting arrangement if the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software 
arrangements that do not give the customer such an option are service contracts and are outside the scope of the company s current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with existing industry practice and with eitf issue no 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market related risks we currently have no floating rate indebtedness  hold no derivative instruments  and do not earn foreign sourced income 
accordingly  changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates do not have a direct effect on our financial position 
however  increases in interest rates generally reduce consumer demand for real estate and other significant purchases and  therefore  could affect the volume of business transacted in our marketplace 
however  the company did grow the business in while interest rates were rising 
subsequent to the year ended december   the company did enter into revolving credit facilities described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
these revolving credit facilities require that certain portions of the interest accruing on outstanding borrowings be paid in the form of warrants for the company s common stock interest warrants 
while the number of interest warrants to be issued under the million revolving line of credit and million revolving loans will be determined as described in the notes to the company s financial statements  the actual amount of interest expense will be based on the fair value of these securities on the date that they are issued 
accordingly  for every interest warrant issued  each dollar that the price of the company s common stock on each interest warrant issuance date exceeds will increase the actual interest expense recorded by the company by approximately one dollar
