cash flow hedging transactions the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  but utilizes them to manage exposure to variable rate debt 
the company accounts for its derivative instruments under sfas no 
 which was adopted in the third quarter of the company has entered into three cash flow hedge agreements  all of which are designated as cash flow hedges of libor based interest payments  made by the company during each month  that repriced closest to two london banking days prior to the designated reset dates of each hedge agreement 
the company uses the cumulative approach  as described in derivatives implementation group dig issue e  to assess effectiveness of the cash flow hedges 
the dig is a task force designed to assist the fasb in answering questions that companies have resulting from implementation of sfas no 
the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness will be based on the cumulative dollar offset method 
under this method  the company will compare the changes in the floating rate leg of each cash flow hedge to the floating rate cash flows of the hedged items 
the cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective 
changes in the fair value of these highly effective hedging instruments are to be recorded in comprehensive income 
the effective portion that has been deferred in comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged items impact earnings 
if any of the cash flow hedges fall outside effectiveness  all changes in the fair value of those cash flow hedges will be recognized in earnings during the current period 
on september   the company entered into a four year cash flow hedge agreement with salomon brothers holding company  inc salomon for a notional amount of million 
the company designates the agreement as a cash flow hedge of the libor based interest payments  made by the company during each month  that repriced closest to two london banking days prior to the first of september  december  march and june through september  that  in the aggregate for each period  are payments on million principal of its then existing libor indexed floating rate loans 
the cash flow hedge can be matched against million of the designated pool of variable rate libor indexed debt principal 
during the year ended december   the cash flow hedge agreement with salomon resulted in a reduction of approximately million of interest expense 
as of december   the fair value of the cash flow hedge was approximately million 
effective february   the company entered into a three year cash flow hedge agreement with fleet boston  for a notional amount of million 
the company designates the agreement as a cash flow hedge of the libor based interest payments  made by the company during each month  that repriced closest to two london banking days prior to the third of every month through february  that  in the aggregate for each month  are payments on million principal of its then existing libor indexed floating rate loans 
the cash flow hedge can be matched against million of the designated pool of variable rate libor indexed debt principal 
during the year ended december   the cash flow hedge agreement with fleet boston resulted in approximately million of additional interest expense 
as of december   the fair value of the cash flow hedge was approximately million 
effective april   the company entered into a four year cash flow hedge agreement with fleet boston  for a notional amount of million 
the company designates the agreement as a cash flow hedge of the libor based interest payments  made by the company during each month  that repriced closest to two london banking days prior to the th of every month through april  that  in the aggregate for each month  are payments on million principal of its then existing libor indexed floating rate loans 
the cash flow hedge can be matched against million of the designated pool of variable rate libor indexed debt principal 
fleet boston has an option to terminate the agreement at the end of the third year of the agreement 
since fleet boston has the option to terminate the cash flow hedge early  any changes in the time value of the cash flow hedge will be recorded through earnings

as of december   the fair value of the cash flow hedge was approximately million 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  based on the revised definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  effective january   and as used in this document  means o net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  o excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  o excluding extraordinary items as defined by gaap  o plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and o after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
effective january   nareit clarified the definition of ffo to include non recurring events  except for i those that are defined as extraordinary items under gaap and ii gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
the company has adopted the revised definition of ffo effective as of january  under the prior definition of ffo  for the year ended december   ffo was approximately million  which excluded million paid in connection with the settlement and release of all claims between the company and station arising out of the agreement and plan of merger between the company and station 
because this settlement is not considered an extraordinary item under gaap  ffo for the year ended december  would have been approximately million  which would have included the million settlement payment  if the revised definition of ffo had been in effect 
the company considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit  and for its investment segments 
however  ffo o does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income  o is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs  and o should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s operating performance  or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of either liquidity or the company s ability to make distributions 
the company has historically distributed an amount less than ffo  primarily due to reserves required for capital expenditures  including leasing costs 
the aggregate cash distributions paid to shareholders and unitholders for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
an increase or decrease in ffo does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because the company s board of trust managers is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for the company to maintain reit status 
however  the company must distribute beginning in of its reit taxable income as defined in the code 
therefore  a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders and unitholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 
accordingly  the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo should be considered in conjunction with the company s net income loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements 
however  the company s measure of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits because these reits may apply the definition of ffo in a different manner than the company

capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent and timing of improvements required to be made in the company s office property portfolio 
the company maintains an active preventive maintenance program in order to minimize required capital improvements 
in addition  certain capital improvement costs are recoverable from tenants 
tenant improvement and leasing costs also may fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the property  the term of the lease  the type of lease renewal or replacement tenant  the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions 
management believes that future recurring tenant improvements and leasing costs for the company s existing office properties will approximate on average for renewal tenants to per square foot  or to per square foot per year based on an average five year lease term  and  on average for replacement tenants  to per square foot  or to per square foot per year based on an average five year lease term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s use of financial instruments  such as debt instruments  subject the company to market risk which may affect the company s future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of its assets 
market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the company manages its market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from its operating  investment and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments  distributions to shareholders  investments  capital expenditures and other cash requirements 
the company also enters into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following discussion of market risk is based solely on hypothetical changes in interest rates related to the company s variable rate debt 
this discussion does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect the financial instruments discussed in this section 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate risk is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates on its short term variable rate debt 
the company had total outstanding debt of approximately billion at december   of which approximately billion  or approximately  was unhedged variable rate debt 
the weighted average interest rate on such variable rate debt was as of december  a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on such variable rate debt would result in an annual decrease in net income and cash flows of approximately million based on the unhedged variable rate debt outstanding as of december   as a result of the increased interest expense associated with the change in rate 
conversely  a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on such unhedged variable rate debt would result in an annual increase in net income and cash flows of approximately million based on the unhedged variable rate debt outstanding as of december   as a result of the decreased interest expense associated with the change in rate
