credit extension activities traditionally  the majority of a typical thrift institution s loan portfolio has consisted of first mortgage loans on residential properties 
however  as a result of various legislative and regulatory changes since  the commercial and consumer lending powers of wsfs have increased substantially 
consequently  wsfs initiated a diversification strategy in fiscal year which included a significant increase in commercial real estate lending 
commercial real estate lending was temporarily discontinued in and only originations required by previous funding commitments were made 
in  wsfs began to originate small business and commercial real estate loans in its primary market area 
wsfs current lending activity is concentrated on lending to consumers and small businesses in the mid atlantic region of the united states 
the following table sets forth the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio by type of loan at each of the dates indicated

the following table sets forth information as of december  regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the company s portfolios  including scheduled repayments of principal  based on contractual terms to maturity 
in addition  the table sets forth the dollar amount of loans maturing during the indicated periods  based on whether the loan has a fixed or adjustable rate 
loans having no stated maturity or repayment schedule are reported in the one year or less category

the above schedule does not include any prepayment assumptions 
although prepayments tend to be highly dependent upon the current interest rate environment  management believes that the actual repricing and maturity of the loan portfolio is significantly shorter than is reflected in the above table as a result of prepayments 
residential real estate lending 
wsfs originates residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios up to  however  wsfs generally requires private mortgage insurance for up to of the mortgage amount on mortgage loans whose loan to value ratio exceeds 
wsfs does not have any significant concentrations of such insurance with any one insurer 
on a very limited basis  wsfs originates purchases loans with loan to value ratios exceeding without a private mortgage insurance requirement 
at december   the balance of all such loans was approximately million 
generally  residential mortgage loans originated or purchased are underwritten and documented in accordance with standard underwriting criteria published by fhlmc to assure maximum eligibility for subsequent sale in the secondary market  however  unless loans are specifically designated for sale  the company holds newly originated loans in portfolio for long term investment 
among other things  title insurance is required  insuring the priority of its lien  and fire and extended coverage casualty insurance for the properties securing the residential loans 
all properties securing residential loans made by wsfs are appraised by independent appraisers selected by wsfs and subject to review in accordance with wsfs standards 
the majority of residential real estate adjustable rate loans currently originated have interest rates that adjust yearly  after an initial period  with the change in rate limited to two percentage points at any adjustment date 
the adjustments are generally based upon a margin currently percent over the weekly average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity  as published by the federal reserve board 
generally  the maximum rate on these loans is up to six percent above the initial interest rate 
wsfs generally underwrites adjustable rate loans under standards consistent with private mortgage insurance and secondary market criteria 
wsfs does not originate adjustable rate mortgages with payment limitations that could produce negative amortization 
consistent with industry practice in its market area  wsfs has typically originated adjustable rate mortgage loans with initially discounted interest rates 
all such loans are underwritten at the fully indexed rate 
the retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans in wsfs loan portfolio helps mitigate wsfs risk to changes in interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of the repricing of adjustable rate mortgage loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower 
further  although adjustable rate mortgage loans allow wsfs to increase the sensitivity of its asset base to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on wsfs adjustable rate mortgages will adjust sufficiently to compensate for increases in wsfs cost of funds during periods of extreme interest rate increases 
the original contractual loan payment period for residential loans originated is normally to years 
because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans without penalty  such loans normally remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time 
first mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses on adjustable and fixed rate loans  which are provisions giving the institutions the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage 
due on sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rate on existing fixed rate mortgage loans to current market rates 
wsfs enforces due on sale clauses through foreclosure and other legal proceedings to the extent available under applicable laws 
in addition to loans originated for its own portfolio  wsfs originates nonconforming residential mortgage loans through its non wholly owned subsidiary  wilmington national finance  inc wnf  for resale into the secondary market on a servicing release  limited recourse basis 
these loans are originated to the underwriting guidelines of the various investors to which wnf sells its loans  and such loans are typically sold to investors within to days of origination 
the mortgage loans that wnf originates are fully amortizing  fixed or adjustable rate  first or second lien mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties with loan to value ratios up to and contractual terms of to years 
with respect to each property securing a mortgage loan  the underwriting guidelines require among other things  title insurance  fire and extended coverage casualty insurance  and a full appraisal by an independent appraisers selected and reviewed by wnf 
the majority of adjustable rate mortgage loans are originated by wnf are indexed to the six month london interbank offered rate libor and have rates that adjust every months after a initial fixed rate period of to months  with the adjustments limited to two percentage at any adjustment date and six percentage points over the live of the loan 
in general  loans are sold without recourse except for the repurchase arising from standard contract provisions covering violation of representations and warranties or  under certain investor contracts a default by borrower on the first payment due to the investor 
the company also has limited recourse exposure under certain investor contracts in the event a borrower prepays a loan in total within a specified period after sale  typically one year  with such recourse limited to a pro rata portion of the premium paid by the investor for that loan less any prepayment penalty collectible from the borrower 
commercial real estate  construction and commercial lending 
federal savings banks  are generally permitted to invest up to of their total regulatory capital in nonresidential real estate loans and up to of its assets in commercial loans 
as a federal savings bank which was formerly chartered as a delaware savings bank  however  wsfs has certain additional lending authority 
wsfs offers commercial real estate mortgage loans on multi family and other commercial real estate 
generally  loan to value ratios for such loans do not exceed of appraised value at origination 
wsfs offers commercial construction loans to developers 
in some cases these loans are made as construction permanent loans  which provides for disbursement of loan funds during construction and automatic conversion to mini permanent loans years upon completion of construction 
such construction loans are made on a short term basis  usually not exceeding two years  with interest rates indexed to the wsfs prime rate  in most cases  and adjusted periodically as wsfs prime rate changes 
the loan appraisal process includes the same evaluation criteria as required for permanent mortgage loans  but also takes into consideration completed plans  specifications  comparables and cost estimates 
these items are used  prior to approval of the credit  as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property when completed 
policy requires that all appraisals are to be reviewed independently of the commercial lending area 
generally  the loan to value ratio for construction loans does not exceed 
the initial interest rate on the permanent portion of the financing is determined based upon the prevailing market rate at the time of conversion to the permanent loan 
at december   million was committed for construction loans  of which million had been disbursed 
wsfs commercial lending  excluding real estate loans  includes loans for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes 
these loans generally range in amounts up to approximately million  and their terms range from less than one year to seven years 
the loans generally carry variable interest rates indexed to wsfs prime rate or libor at the time of closing 
wsfs intends to continue originating commercial loans to small businesses in its market area 
commercial  commercial mortgages and construction lending entail significant risk as compared with residential mortgage lending 
these loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated in single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the economy generally 
the majority of wsfs commercial and commercial real estate loans is concentrated in delaware and surrounding areas 
construction loans involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced as the construction progresses 
the valuation of the underlying collateral can be difficult to quantify prior to the completion of the construction due to uncertainties inherent in construction such as ever changing construction costs  delays arising from labor or material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies 
wsfs attempts to mitigate these risks and plan for these contingencies through additional analysis and monitoring of its construction projects 
federal law limits the extensions of credit to any one borrower to of unimpaired capital  or  if the additional incremental is secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value that can be determined by reliable and continually available pricing 
a single large extension of credit by wsfs would be limited by this of capital restriction  except if the extension of credit would be fully or partially secured by us treasury securities 
extensions of credit include outstanding loans as well as contractual commitments to advance funds  such as standby letters of credit  but do not include unfunded loan commitments 
in april  wsfs originated a million loan to refinance an employee stock ownership plan esop loan of a company 
approximately of the loan is secured by discounted us treasury securities 
the portion of the loan that is secured by us treasury securities is exempt from the above lending limits 
at december   no borrower had collective outstandings exceeding the above limits 
consumer lending 
the primary consumer credit products of the company are equity secured installment loans and home equity lines of credit 
at december   wsfs had equity secured installment loans totaling million  which represented of consumer loans 
with a home equity line of credit the borrower is granted a line of credit up to of the appraised value net of any senior mortgages of the residence 
this line of credit is secured by a mortgage on the borrower s property and can be drawn upon at any time 
at december   wsfs had extended a total of million in home equity lines of credit  of which million had been drawn at the date 
home equity lines of credit potentially offer federal income tax advantages in certain circumstances the interest paid on a home equity loan can be deductible and the convenience of checkbook access as well as revolving credit features 
over the past few years  however  home equity lines of credit have decreased as low interest rates offered on first and second mortgage loans have enabled consumers to refinance their mortgages and consolidate debt 
although home equity lines of credit expose the company to the risk that falling collateral values may leave it inadequately secured  the company has not had any significant adverse experience to date 
the table below sets forth consumer loans by type  in dollar amounts and percentages  at the dates indicated

wsfs has traditionally engaged in lending activities primarily in delaware and contiguous areas of neighboring states although  as a federal savings bank  wsfs may originate  purchase and sell loans throughout the united states 
wsfs has also purchased limited amounts of loans from outside its normal lending area when such purchases are deemed appropriate and consistent with wsfs overall practices 
wsfs originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential real estate loans through banking offices 
in addition  for the purpose of originating loans  wsfs has established relationships with correspondent banks and mortgage brokers 
during  the company originated million of residential real estate loans  of which million were from wnf compared to originations of million in total 
from time to time  wsfs has purchased whole loans and loan participations in accordance with its ongoing asset and liability management objectives 
in addition  increases in residential real estate loans from correspondents and brokers primarily in the mid atlantic region of the united states totaled million for the year ended december   million for and million for residential real estate loan sales totaled million in  million in and million in while wsfs generally intends to hold loans for the foreseeable future  wsfs  beginning in  has undertaken to sell newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to control the interest sensitivity of its balance sheet 
during the second half of the corporation began to hold for investment certain of its fixed rate mortgage loans  with terms under years  consistent with current asset liability management strategies 
wsfs serviced for others approximately million of residential loans at december  compared to million at december  the company also services residential loans for its portfolio totaling million and million at december  and wsfs originates commercial real estate and commercial loans through wsfs commercial lending department 
commercial loans are made for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes and also include business loans secured by nonresidential real estate 
during  wsfs originated million of commercial and commercial real estate loans compared to million in these amounts represent gross contract amounts and do not reflect amounts outstanding on such loans 
wsfs consumer lending is conducted primarily through the branch offices 
wsfs originates a variety of consumer credit products  including home improvement loans  home equity lines of credit  automobile loans  credit cards  unsecured lines of credit and other secured and unsecured personal installment loans 
during  such consumer loan originations aggregated million compared to million in see consumer lending for a further discussion regarding consumer loan originations 
all loans to one borrower exceeding million in aggregate must be approved by a management loan committee 
minutes of the management loan committee meetings and individual loans exceeding million approved by the management loan committee are subsequently reviewed by the executive committee and board of directors of wsfs  with separate approval needed for all loans to any borrower who has direct or indirect outstanding commitments in excess of million or for any additional advances or extensions on loans previously classified by wsfs regulatory authorities or wsfs risk management department 
officers of wsfs have authority to approve smaller loans in graduated amounts  depending upon their experience and management position 
fee income from lending activities 
wsfs realizes interest and loan fee income from lending activities  including fees for originating loans and for servicing loans and loan participations sold 
the institution also receive commitment fees for making commitments to originate construction  residential and commercial real estate loans 
additionally  loan fees related to existing loans are received  which include prepayment charges  late charges and assumption fees 
wsfs offers a range of loan commitments for which fees are charged depending on lengths of the commitment periods 
as part of the loan application  the borrower in some instances  also pays wsfs for out of pocket costs in reviewing the application  whether or not the loan is closed 
the interest rate charged on the mortgage loan is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved 
loan fees that are considered adjustments of yield in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are reflected in interest income and represented an immaterial amount of interest income during the three years ended december  loan fees other than those considered adjustments of yield are reported as loan fee income  a component of other income 
all fee income on loans originated by wnf for sale to third party investors  which includes origination fees and discount points collected from borrowers and sales premiums paid by investors  are recognized in total upon sale of the loans to the third party investors less adequate provision for recourse obligations 
loan loss experience  problem assets and delinquencies the company s results of operations can be negatively impacted by nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued  but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
the company endeavors to manage its portfolios to identify problem loans as promptly as possible and take actions immediately which will minimize losses 
to accomplish this  wsfs risk management department monitors the asset quality of the company s loan and investment in real estate portfolios and reports such information to the credit policy committee the audit committee of the board of directors and the controller s department

the director of ots may only approve acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings associations in more than one state if i the company involved controls a savings institution which operated a home or branch office in the state of the association to be acquired as of march   ii the acquirer is authorized to acquire control of the savings association pursuant to the emergency acquisition provisions of the federal deposit insurance act  or iii the statutes of the state in which the association to be acquired is located specifically permit institutions to be acquired by state chartered associations or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located or by a holding company that controls such state chartered savings institutions 
the laws of delaware do not specifically authorize out of state savings associations or their holding companies to acquire delaware chartered savings associations 
the statutory restrictions on the formation of interstate multiple holding companies would not prevent wsfs from entering into other states by mergers or branching 
ots regulations permit federal associations to branch in any state or states of the united states and its territories 
except in supervisory cases or when interstate branching is otherwise permitted by state law or other statutory provision  a federal association may not establish an out of state branch unless the federal association qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under section 
a of the internal revenue code or as a qualified thrift lender under the home owners loan act and the total assets attributable to all branches of the association in the state would qualify such branches taken as a whole for treatment as a domestic building and loan association or qualified thrift lender 
federal associations generally may not establish new branches unless the association meets or exceeds minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the ots will also consider the association s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act of in connection with any branch application 
regulation of wsfs general 
as a federally chartered savings institution  wsfs is subject to extensive regulation by the ots 
the lending activities and other investments of wsfs must comply with various federal regulatory requirements 
the ots periodically examines wsfs for compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fdic also has the authority to conduct special examinations of wsfs as the insurer of deposits 
wsfs must file reports with ots describing its activities and financial condition 
wsfs is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere herein 
regulatory capital requirements 
under ots capital regulations  savings institutions must maintain tangible capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier or core capital equal to of adjusted total assets or if the institution is rated composite under the ots examiner rating system  and total capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
in addition  ots regulations impose certain restrictions on savings associations that have a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of less than or a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total assets of less than or if the institution is rated composite under the ots examination rating system 
for purposes of these regulations  tier capital has the same definition as core capital 
the ots capital rule defines tier or core capital as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual institutions and qualifying supervisory goodwill  less intangible assets other than certain supervisory goodwill and  subject to certain limitations  mortgage and non mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships 
tangible capital is given the same definition as core capital but does not include qualifying supervisory goodwill and is reduced by the amount of all the savings institution s intangible assets except for limited amounts of mortgage servicing rights 
the ots capital rule requires that core and tangible capital be reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution s debt and equity investments in nonincludable subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks  other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies 
adjusted total assets for purposes of the core and tangible capital requirements are a savings institution s total assets as determined under generally accepted accounting principles  increased by certain goodwill amounts and by a prorated portion of the assets of unconsolidated includable subsidiaries in which the savings institution holds a minority interest 
adjusted total assets are reduced by the amount of assets that have been deducted from capital  the savings institution s minority investments in unconsolidated includable subsidiaries and  for purposes of the core capital requirement  qualifying supervisory goodwill 
at december   wsfs was in compliance with both the core and tangible capital requirements 
the risk based capital requirement is measured against risk weighted assets  which equal the sum of each on balance sheet asset and the credit equivalent amount of each off balance sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight 
under the ots risk weighting system  cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government are given a risk weight 
mortgage backed securities that qualify under the secondary mortgage enhancement act  including those issued  or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest  by the fnma or fhlmc  are assigned a risk weight 
single family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios not exceeding  fixed rate multi family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios not exceeding if rate is adjustable  and annual net operating income equal to not less than of debt service if loan is adjustable and certain qualifying loans for the construction of one to four family residences pre sold to home purchasers are assigned a risk weight of 
consumer loans  non qualifying residential construction loans and commercial real estate loans  repossessed assets and assets more than days past due  as well as all other assets not specifically categorized  are assigned a risk weight of 
the portion of equity investments not deducted from core or supplementary capital is assigned a risk weight 
in determining compliance with the risk based capital requirement  a savings institution is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital  provided the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings institution s core capital 
supplementary capital is defined to include certain preferred stock issues  nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits that do not qualify as core capital  certain approved subordinated debt  certain other capital instruments and a portion of the savings institution s general loan loss allowances 
the ots risk based capital standards require savings institutions with more than a normal level of interest rate risk to maintain additional total capital 
a savings institution s interest rate risk is measured in terms of the sensitivity of its net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
a savings association with more than normal interest rate risk is required to deduct an interest rate risk component equal to one half of the excess of its measured interest rate risk over the normal level from its total capital for purposes of determining its compliance with the ots risk based capital guidelines 
at december   wsfs was in compliance with the ots risk based capital requirements 
loans to directors  officers and stockholders 
under section h of the federal reserve act  loans to an executive officer or director or to a greater than stockholder of a savings association and certain affiliated interests of either  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests  the association s loans to one borrower limit generally equal to of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to all such persons may not exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
section h also prohibits loans  above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency  to directors  executive officers and greater than stockholders of a savings association  and their respective affiliates  unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the association with any interested director not participating in the voting 
the federal reserve board has prescribed the loan amount which includes all other outstanding loans to such person  as to which such prior board of director approval if required  as being the greater of  or of capital and surplus up to 
further  loans to directors  executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not discriminate in favor of insiders 
section h also prohibits a depository institution from paying the overdrafts of any of its executive officers or directors 
savings associations are subject to the requirements and restrictions of section g of the federal reserve act which requires that loans to executive officers of depository institutions not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded to other borrowers  requires approval for such extensions of credit by the board of directors of the institution  and imposes reporting requirements for and additional restrictions on the type  amount and terms of credits to such officers 
section of the bank holding company act of bhca prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  and greater than stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
dividend restrictions 
savings associations must submit notice to the ots prior to making a capital distribution which includes cash dividends  stock repurchases and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash merger if a they would not be well capitalized after the distribution  b the distribution would result in the retirement of any of the association s common or preferred stock or debt counted as its regulatory capital  or c the association is a subsidiary of a holding company 
a savings association must make application to the ots to pay a capital distribution if x the association would not be adequately capitalized following the distribution  y the association s total distributions for the calendar year exceeds the association s net income for the calendar year to date plus its net income less distributions for the preceding two years  or z the distribution would otherwise violate applicable law or regulation or an agreement with or condition imposed by the ots 
deposit insurance 
wsfs may be charged semi annual premiums by the fdic for federal insurance on its insurable deposit accounts up to applicable regulatory limits 
the fdic may establish an assessment rate for deposit insurance premiums which protects the insurance fund and considers the fund s operating expenses  case resolution expenditures  income and effect of the assessment rate on the earnings and capital of members 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic which is determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using the same percentage criteria as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
see prompt corrective action 
within each capital group  institutions will be assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
because the bank insurance fund bif achieved its statutory reserve ratio of of insured deposits  the fdic has eliminated deposit insurance premiums for most bif members 
the fdic  however  continues to assess bif member institutions to fund interest payments on certain bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to help fund takeovers of insolvent thrifts 
until december   bif members were assessed at approximately one fifth the rate at which savings association insurance fund saif members were assessed 
after december   bif and saif members are being assessed at the same rate 
prompt corrective action 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to become undercapitalized 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution generally is i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
significantly undercapitalized institutions and their holding companies may become subject to more severe sanctions including limitations on asset growth  restrictions on capital distributions by the holding company and possible divestiture requirements 
institutions generally must be placed in receivership within specified periods of time after they become critically undercapitalized 
under the ots regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  the ots measures a savings institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
a savings institution that is not subject to an order or written directive to meet or maintain a specific capital level is deemed well capitalized if it also has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater 
an adequately capitalized savings institution is a savings institution that does not meet the definition of well capitalized and has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier capital risk based ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater if the savings institution has a composite camels rating 
an undercapitalized institution is a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or if the institution has a composite camels rating 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is defined as a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than 
a critically undercapitalized savings institution is defined as a savings institution that has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of less than 
federal home loan bank system 
wsfs is a member of the fhlb system  which consists of district fhlbs subject to supervision and regulation by the federal housing finance board fhfb 
the fhlbs provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
as a member of the fhlb of pittsburgh  wsfs is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb of pittsburgh in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh  whichever is greater 
wsfs was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in fhlb of pittsburgh stock at december   of million 
the fhlb of pittsburgh offers advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhfb and the board of directors of the fhlb of pittsburgh

federal reserve system 
pursuant to regulations of the federal reserve board  a savings institution must maintain average daily reserves equal to on the first million of transaction accounts  plus on the remainder 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement may be to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
as of december  wsfs met its reserve requirements 
financial modernization legislation on november   president clinton signed legislation which could have a far reaching impact on the financial services industry 
the gramm leach bliley g l b act authorizes affiliations between banking  securities and insurance firms and authorizes bank holding companies and national banks to engage in a variety of new financial activities 
among the new activities that will be permitted to qualifying bank holding companies are securities and insurance brokerage  securities underwriting  insurance underwriting and merchant banking 
the federal reserve board  in consultation with the department of treasury  may approve additional financial activities for bank holding companies 
national bank subsidiaries will be permitted to engage in similar financial activities but only on an agency basis unless they are one of the largest banks in the country 
national bank subsidiaries will be prohibited from insurance underwriting  real estate development and  for at least five years  merchant banking 
the g l b act prohibits future acquisitions of existing unitary savings and loan holding companies  like the company  and firms which are engaged in commercial activities and limits the permissible activities of unitary holding companies formed after may  the g l b act imposes new requirements on financial institutions with respect to customer privacy 
the g l b act generally prohibits disclosure of customer information to non affiliated third parties unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure 
financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually 
financial institutions  however  will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the g l b act 
the g l b act directs the federal banking agencies  the national credit union administration  the secretary of the treasury  the securities and exchange commission and the federal trade commission  after consultation with the national association of insurance commissioners  to promulgate implementing regulations within six months of enactment 
the privacy regulations will become final  effective in july the g l b act contains significant revisions to the federal home loan bank system 
the g l b act imposes new capital requirements on the federal home loan banks and authorizes them to issue two classes of stock with differing dividend rates and redemption requirements 
the g i b act deletes the current requirement that the federal home loan banks annually contribute million to pay interest on certain government obligations in favor of a of net earnings formula 
the g l b act expands the permissible uses of federal home loan bank advances by community financial institutions under million in assets to include funding loans to small businesses  small farms and small agri businesses 
the g l b act makes membership in the federal home loan bank voluntary for federal savings associations 
the g l b act contains a variety of other provisions including a prohibition against atm surcharges unless the customer has first been provided notice of the imposition and the amount of the fee 
the g l b act reduces the frequency of community reinvestment act examinations for smaller institutions and imposes certain reporting requirements on depository institutions that make payments to non governmental entities in connection with the community reinvestment act 
the g l b act eliminates the saif special reserve and authorizes a federal savings association that converts to a national or state bank charter to continue to use the term federal in its name and to retain any interstate branches 
the company is unable to predict the impact of the g l b act on its operations at this time 
although the g l b act reduces the range of companies which may acquire control of the company and with which the company may affiliate  it may facilitate affiliations with companies in the financial services industry

the following discussion focuses on the major components of the company s operations and presents an overview of the significant changes in the results of operations for the past three fiscal years and financial condition during the past two fiscal years 
this discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million and million in and  respectively 
income from continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively net interest income 
net interest income is the most significant component of operating income to the corporation 
net interest income relies upon the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the difference or spread between the respective yields earned and rates paid 
the interest rate spread is influenced by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that affect interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
the level of nonperforming loans can also impact the interest rate spread by reducing the overall yield on the loan portfolio 
net interest income increased to million in compared with million in total interest income increased million  between and  primarily due to an increase in average balances for loans of million over the previous year  offset in part by a million decrease in mortgage backed securities 
in addition to this positive volume variance impact  overall rates were higher in than in  and specifically  the average yield on the reverse mortgage portfolio increased to from  between and for further discussion on reverse mortgages see note of the financial statements 
total interest expense increased million from and as a result of the growth in interest bearing deposits by an average of million  partially offset by a million decrease in average borrowings 
the average rates on deposits increased basis points from to  while the rates on fhlb and other borrowings increased basis points and basis points  respectively 
the cost of funding discontinued operations resulted in an overall decrease in total interest expense of million between and  as a result of the declining balance of this business in between and  interest income increased million  while interest expense decreased  the primary increase in interest income was related to the increase in average balances for mortgaged backed securities of million and an increase in average loan balances of million 
this was offset by a decrease in average interest rates in versus the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decline in average rates offset by an increase in average borrowings of million 
this was partially offset by a decline in the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings of basis points and basis points respectively  between and there was also a million decrease to total interest expense related to the funding of discontinued operations between and the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the rates for the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii changes in rates change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii net change 
changes due to the combination of rate and volume changes changes in volume multiplied by changes in rate are allocated proportionately between changes in rate and changes in volume

provision for loan losses 
the corporation considers  among other things  identifiable and inherent risks in its loan portfolio in periodically establishing the amount of the provision for loan losses and the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
such risks are determined based upon an ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which includes the identification and assessment of adverse situations that may affect borrowers debt servicing ability  an analysis of overall portfolio quality and prior loan loss experience as well as an appraisal of current economic conditions 
accordingly  the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management deems adequate to provide for known and inherent losses 
the corporation s continued efforts to invest in quality loans and resolve and collect problem loans  including nonaccrual and restructured loans favorably impacted the provision 
this was evident in as the provision for loan losses of  was a decrease of  from the allowance for loan losses was million at december   a decrease from the level reported at december  the corporation will continue to adjust the provision for loan losses periodically as necessary to maintain the allowance at what is deemed to be an adequate level  based on the previously discussed criteria 
as the provision is primarily a function of credit quality  changes in the provision for loan losses are contingent upon the economic conditions of the corporation s market area and the economic prospects of borrowers 
other income 
other income of million in  increased million  or during from the corporation s two new not wholly owned startup initiatives  cfn and wnf contributed million to the positive variance  mainly in the form of gains on the sale of loans and other income 
in the corporation recorded a million loss on the sale of below market yielding securities and loans 
credit debit and atm income grew million during  due to the continued expansion of wsfs atm network and customer card usage 
at december  wsfs derived income from  atms compared to  at december  in addition  deposit service charges increased million to million  a result of the growth in core deposits 
partially offsetting these increases was a million increase in securities losses 
these losses were a result of the corporation s de leveraging strategy  in which the corporation sold below market yielding investments to payoff higher cost borrowings 
other income of million in  increased  during from credit debit and atm income grew million during  due to the continued expansion of wsfs atm network and customer card usage 
at december  wsfs derived income from  atms compared to at december  in addition  deposit service charges increased million as a result of growth in deposits 
partially offsetting these increases was  in securities losses and a million loss on the sale of loans 
these losses were a result of the corporation s de leveraging strategy  in which the corporation sold below market yielding investments to pay off higher cost borrowings 
other expenses 
other expenses of million in  increased million or during from the corporation s two new  not wholly owned  startup initiatives  cfn and wnf accounted for million of this increase  mainly in salaries  benefits and other compensation 
the unowned portion of the results of these subsidiaries has been reflected in minority interest  on an after tax basis  in the consolidated statement of operations 
excluding these two startup initiatives expenses increased million or during from these increases were mainly in salaries  equipment expense  occupancy expense and other expenses  partially offset by lower data processing and operations expense  which decreased by  the increases were primarily attributable to investments in retail banking offices  as the corporation added four new branch offices during the year  and the expansion of the cashconnect division atm unit 
in addition  during the third quarter of the corporation re assumed all responsibility for loan and deposit operations that were previously outsourced through alltel  the corporation s information technology provider 
as a result  approximately sixty associates that were previously employed by alltel were re hired by the corporation 
expenses previously recorded as data processing and operations are currently reflected in salaries and benefit expenses 
other expenses of million increased million or during from expenses increased mainly in salaries  equipment expense  professional fees and data processing and operations expense 
these increases were attributable to investments in retail banking offices  atms  and improvements in technology 
as part of this investment the corporation added four new branch offices during the year 
in addition  expenses of million from the not wholly owned cfn and wnf investments are included in other expenses 
the unowned portion of the results of these subsidiaries has been eliminated through minority interest  on an after tax basis  in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes 
the corporation recorded a  tax provision for the year ended december  compared to tax provisions of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state  and local income taxes that are currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
the years   and include the recording of million  million  and million  respectively  in tax benefits  resulting from the merger of a former subsidiary into wsfs 
as a consequence of this merger  certain tax benefits  which were previously offset by a valuation allowance  are now recognizable based primarily upon the continued profitability of the wsfs consolidated group 
approximately million in gross deferred tax assets of the corporation at december  is related to built in losses on reverse mortgages that are attributable to a former subsidiary  providential 
management has continued to assess substantial valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets due to limitations imposed by the internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization on these assets 
as historical data accumulates  management continues to obtain more information on which to base the potential recognition of these assets 
the corporation analyzes its projection of taxable income on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to its provision for income taxes  accordingly

financial condition total assets decreased million or 
during to billion 
this decline occurred predominantly in mortgage backed securities  partially offset by an increase in loans 
the decline in mortgage backed securities resulted primarily from a deleveraging strategy in which the corporation divested of certain investment securities and residential mortgages with below market interest rates  thereby repositioning the balance sheet to allow room for other strategies 
total liabilities decreased million during the year to billion at december  this decrease occurred primarily in borrowings which declined million during the period  as proceeds from the investment and loan sale were used to repay million in fhlb advances 
partially offsetting this decrease were deposits which increased million 
stockholder s equity increased million to million at december  this increase resulted primarily from earnings and the increase in other comprehensive income  offset in part by the acquisition of treasury stock and cash dividends paid 
investments 
between december  and  total investments increased  during  investments in reverse mortgages increased million while federal funds sold increased million 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in investment securities 
mortgage backed securities 
investments in mortgage backed securities decreased million during to million 
this decline resulted primarily from the sale of million in mortgage backed securities  which was mainly a result of the deleveraging strategy 
also contributing to this decline were million in principal repayments 
these decreases were partially offset by purchases of million 
loans 
net loans  including loans held for sale  increased million between december  and this increase was primarily due to a million increase in residential mortgages  a million and a million increase in commercial and consumer loans  respectively 
deposits 
deposits grew million during this growth was largely attributable to a net inflow of deposits of million in and interest credited to deposits of million in the table below depicts the changes in deposits over the last three years year ended december  in millions beginning balance interest credited deposit inflows  net ending balance  borrowings 
total borrowings decreased million between december  and advances from the federal home loan bank decreased million and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase decreased million 
the proceeds from the investment and loan sales as well as deposit inflows were used to repay these balances 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase included million in net income and a million in other comprehensive income 
this was offset in part by the acquisition of  shares of treasury stock for million and dividends of million declared and paid to stockholders 
asset liability management the primary asset liability management goal of the corporation is to manage and control its interest rate risk  thereby reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  and achieving sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term 
other objectives of asset liability management include ensuring adequate liquidity and funding  maintaining a strong capital base and maximizing net interest income opportunities 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
management regularly reviews the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  and uses a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of the primary strategies utilized by the corporation to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of the corporation s interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table less than one to over one year five years five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets real estate loans     commercial loans     consumer loans     mortgage backed securities     loans held for sale   investment in reverse mortgages     investment securities     other investments   interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits    savings deposits    retail time deposits     jumbo certificates of deposit   brokered certificates of deposit    fhlb advances    trust preferred borrowings and interest rate cap   other borrowed funds    excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap     interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets interest sensitive assets of discontinued operations wcc are excluded  however  funding of million for these assets have been included 
includes commercial mortgage loans 
to provide a more accurate one year gap position of the corporation  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of wsfs deposit accounts  that of money market and of interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five year category 
deposit products with interest rates based on a particular index are classified according to the specific repricing characteristic of the index 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
in november  the corporation purchased a ten year interest rate cap in order to limit its exposure on million of variable rate trust preferred securities issued in november this derivative instrument caps month libor the base rate of the trust preferred at 
the trust preferred is classified in the over five year category reflecting the effective inability to price upward beyond the capped rate for the balance of the term on the interest rate cap 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversly  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities  which contractually reprice within the rate period  may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
one measure  required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivatives activities 
this test measures the impact on the net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of the estimated cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the table below is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on net interest margin and net portfolio value at the specified levels at december  and  calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a december  change in interest change in change in rate net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio basis points margin value margin value this column represents the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate environment changes 
this column represents the net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected under the various rate environment changes 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on the company s asset liability structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure can negatively affect the corporation s results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
past due loans are loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the corporation s non performing assets  restructured loans and past due loans at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial     consumer commercial mortgages      residential mortgages      construction  total nonaccruing loans      nonperforming investments in real estate  assets acquired through foreclosure    total nonperforming assets      restructured loans   past due loans residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages   consumer total past due loans      ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan losses allowance to nonaccruing loans ratio of loan losses and foreclosed asset allowance to total nonperforming assets total loans exclude loans held for sale 
the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
total nonperforming assets decreased by million between and and increased  between and the year over year increase reflects the addition in the second quarter of a million commercial real estate relationship 
management does not expect any significant loss on this loan 
in  million in collections of such assets  as well as million in transfers to accrual restructured status contributed to the reduction in nonperforming assets 
such decreases were offset by the addition of million of assets that were not previously classified as nonperforming assets 
an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three fiscal years is presented below year ended december  in thousands beginning balance    additions    collections    transfers to accrual restructured status    transfers to investment in real estate charge offs write downs    ending balance    the level of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio increased from in to in the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio increased from in to in these increases were primarily due to the increase in nonaccruing loans and nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets 
in  an increase of  in the commercial mortgage category and an increase of  in construction loans accounted for the majority of the increase in total nonperforming assets 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation maintains allowances for credit losses and charges losses to these allowances when such losses are realized 
the allowances for losses are maintained at a level which management considers adequate to provide for known and inherent losses based upon an evaluation of risks in the portfolios 
management s evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the portfolios  which include factors such as identification of adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  a review of overall portfolio quality  prior loss experience and an assessment of current and expected economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions and economic prospects of debtors can occur quickly  and as a result  impact the estimates made by management 
additionally  each quarter  management evaluates the collectibility of each loan in the nonperforming portfolio and the fair value of each asset in the assets acquired through foreclosure category 
the most frequent forms of collateral for loans and foreclosed assets are income producing properties  business owned real estate and personal residences 
the value of such collateral is frequently verified through the use of outside appraisals 
appraisals of collateral  together with the value of guarantees and the worth of other collateral  are combined to recognize current losses  write downs of foreclosed assets  and to reserve for future losses 
the table below represents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance      provision for loan losses   reclass from allowance for ore losses balance at acquisition of credit card portfolio charge offs residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer  total charge offs      recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total recoveries net charge offs      ending balance      net charge offs to average gross loans outstanding  net of unearned income includes commercial mortgage and construction loans 
the provision for loan losses declined modestly by  between and net charge offs increased  between and annual net charge offs for the five year period ranged from

the allowance for losses is allocated by major portfolio type 
as these portfolios have seasoned  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure  however  such allocations are not indicative of where future losses will occur

the liquidity ratios of wsfs were and at december  and  respectively 
management monitors liquidity daily and maintains funding sources to meet unforeseen changes in cash requirements 
it is the practice of wsfs to maintain cash and investments at least slightly above required levels 
the corporation s primary financing sources are deposits  repayments of loans and investment securities  sales of loans and borrowings 
in addition  the corporation s liquidity requirements can be accomplished through the use of its borrowing capacity from the fhlb of pittsburgh  the sale of certain securities and the pledging of certain loans for other lines of credit 
management believes these sources are sufficient to maintain the required and prudent levels of liquidity 
at december  and  wsfs had outstanding fhlb advances of million and million  respectively 
the corporation routinely enters into commitments requiring the future outlay of funds 
currently wsfs is in the final year of a five year agreement with its data processing facilities management company 
under the terms of this agreement  a minimum payment of approximately million for the year has been committed 
the corporation has entered into a five year commitment with telecommunication companies 
under the terms of this agreement  the average minimum payment for each of the five years is million 
the aforementioned commitments  as well as loan commitments  are expected to be met through traditional funding sources  such as deposits  short term borrowings  advances from the fhlb and principal repayments on loans and investments 
during  operating and financing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of  and million  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the cash provided by operating and financing activities resulted primarily from net income  the sales of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as increases in demand and savings deposits 
this cash was used to fund the purchase of mortgage backed securities and to fund an increase in loans  as well as to repay borrowings and purchase treasury stock 
in  financing activities provided million of cash and cash equivalents  while operating and investing activities used million and million  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from additional fhlb advances and increases in demand and time deposits 
this cash was utilized to fund the purchase of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as the repayment of other borrowings  and to fund the net increase in loan volume 
during  the operating and financing activities provided million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the cash provided by operating and financing activities reflect the additional fhlb advances 
this cash was used to fund the purchase of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as for the repayment of other borrowings and the purchase of treasury stock 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as wsfs to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   wsfs is classified as well capitalized and is in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
for additional information concerning wsfs regulatory capital compliance see note to the financial statements 
as part of capital management  the corporation from time to time purchases its own shares of common stock to be included in its treasury 
since  the board of directors has approved five separate stock repurchase programs to reacquire common stock outstanding 
as part of these programs  the corporation acquired million shares in   shares in  million shares in   shares in and million shares in at december   the corporation held million shares of its common stock in the treasury 
the corporation may continue repurchasing shares in impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of the corporation s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the corporation are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the corporation s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services
