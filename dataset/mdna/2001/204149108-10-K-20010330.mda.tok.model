item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview community trust bancorp  inc reported record net earnings of million for  compared to million for and million for earnings per share for were compared to per share for and per share for earnings for reflected an increase in net interest income while noninterest income was negatively impacted by a decline in consumer loan related fees and the sale of secondary market residential real estate loans 
the corporation continues to improve efficiencies with a million decline in noninterest expense compared to the loan loss provision remained materially even with only a slight thousand increase year over year 
the corporation s return on average assets for was as compared to and in and  respectively  and the return on average equity for was as compared to and for and  respectively 
total assets as of december  were billion as compared to total assets of billion on december  total loans as of december  were billion compared to billion as of december   an increase of 
total deposits increased from billion at december  to billion at december  acquisitions during  the corporation continued our strategic plan of expansion of our business through acquisitions within targeted markets 
on january   community trust bank  na acquired the deposits  loans  and fixed assets of the bank of mt 
vernon  inc  a subsidiary of premier financial bancorp  inc  nasdaq pfbi of georgetown  kentucky 
the bank of mt 
vernon  inc s offices are located in mt 
vernon  somerset  richmond  and berea  kentucky 
the offices acquired had deposits totaling million and loans totaling million 
the bank also opened a new branch location on october   in corbin  kentucky 
the acquisition of the mt 
vernon operations and the opening of the corbin branch provide the corporation with market coverage of the interstate corridor from lexington  kentucky to the tennessee state line 
on december   the corporation completed the merger of community trust bank  fsb  into our lead bank  community trust bank  na  to attain greater operational efficiencies 
results of operations compared to net income for was million compared to million for basic earnings per share for were compared to per share for the number of shares outstanding at december  and december  were  and  respectively 
net interest income for remained relatively flat as compared to  rising from million in to million in noninterest income decreased from million in to million in while noninterest expense decreased from million in to million in see separate discussions of noninterest income and noninterest expense below 
return on average assets increased from in to in  and return on average equity decreased from in to in net interest income the company successfully held our net interest margin relatively stable for the year at compared to for some of the pressure on the net interest margin was offset by a basis point increase in our average earning assets as a percentage of total assets which were at year end compared to at year end see the table on page titled consolidated average balance sheets and taxable equivalent income expense and yields rates for further information 
the corporation s average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities also increased during the period  from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets remained fairly stable  moving from in to in the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets increased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities also increased during the same period from to 
the yield on interest bearing assets has been impacted by the change in the earning asset mix as well as by the increase in market rates in loans accounted for of all earning assets in while loans accounted for of earning assets in loans accounted for of total assets as of december  compared to as of december  as presented in the interest rate sensitivity table in the liquidity section that is included later in the management discussion and analysis  the corporation s balance sheet is positively gapped over a twelve month period 
this means that in an interest rate change  a larger dollar volume of interest bearing assets will reprice than will interest bearing liabilities 
in a decreasing rate environment  such as that experienced in early  our positive gap position could have a negative impact on the net interest margin 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased from million in to million in charge offs  net of recoveries  as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreased from in to in as net charge offs decreased by million in to million 
the allowance for loan losses alll declined from of total loans at december  to at december  the special provision of million that was added to the alll in to cover remaining anticipated losses of pre indirect loans has been substantially utilized 
the improving quality and loss experience of our indirect portfolio indicates an above normal reserve is not required for this loan product 
overall loss experience improved for  and all categories of loans saw reduced losses except commercial loans  which increased from to 
however  the loss ratio in was abnormally low  as the three year moving average for commercial losses was as of december  nonperforming loans  which are primarily commercial loans  increased from of total loans at december  to at december  as a result  an additional million loss reserve was allocated to commercial loans at december  allocation for indirect losses was reduced by million due to the improved quality of the indirect portfolio and the substantial recognition of the remaining losses in the pre indirect loans 
the allowance for loan losses is established at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon estimates derived from an analysis of individual credits  prior and current loss experience  loan portfolio delinquency levels  overall growth in the loan portfolio  and current economic conditions 
such factors are considered when establishing the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
as a result  a portion of the allowance for loan losses is not allocated to a specific loan product 
these estimates are susceptible to changes that could result in an adjustment to results of operations 
the provision for loan losses represents a charge against current earnings in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level 
reserve allocations are calculated for each loan category based upon a three year moving average of the loss experience for that loan category 
in addition  where the potential for loss on specific loans has been identified  that amount is also included in the reserve allocation 
the alll is then adjusted for overall characteristics of the current loan portfolio  such as delinquency trends  level of non performing loans  industry concentrations of credit  and loss recovery rates 
in addition  adjustments are made for changes in current economic conditions 
management also considers the overall growth of the loan portfolio 
noninterest income noninterest income decreased from million in to million in  due to a decline in consumer loan related fees and sales of secondary market residential real estate loans 
service charges on deposit related products generated million for the year  as compared to million for the previous year 
trust income increased from million in to million in as trust assets under management increased during the year 
gains on sale of residential mortgage loans decreased from million in to million in  while a gain of million was recognized in on the sale of two commercial loans not previously held for sale 
other noninterest income decreased from million in to million in securities gains and losses were not a significant factor in either or  as the corporation incurred net securities gains of  in and neither a gain nor loss in noninterest expense the company continued to experience improvements in operational efficiencies due to consolidation efforts commenced during the past three years as total noninterest expenses for of million were million less than the million for the efficiency ratio improved basis points  decreasing to from at year end the deposit to fte full time equivalent ratio increased from million to million year over year 
salaries and employee benefits decreased from million in to million in occupancy expense increased from million in to million in while equipment expense decreased from million to million  respectively 
data processing costs increased from million in to million in and stationery and printing costs decreased from million in to million in taxes other than payroll  property and income  which consists mainly of franchise taxes on the equity and deposits of the corporation  increased from million in to million in other categories of noninterest expense declined from million in to million in compared to net income for was million compared to million for basic earnings per share for were compared to per share for net interest income for increased as compared to  rising from million in to million in noninterest income increased from million in to million in while noninterest expense increased from million in to million in see separate discussions of noninterest income and noninterest expense below 
return on average assets increased from in to in  and return on average equity increased from in to in net interest income the corporation s net interest margin increased from at the end of to at the end of as a result of the increase in loans outstanding  the management of deposit cost  and the increase in yield on loans as a result of market changes 
see the table on page titled consolidated average balance sheets and taxable equivalent income expense and yields rates for further information 
the corporation s average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities also increased during the period  from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets remained fairly stable  moving from in to in the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets decreased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities also decreased from to during the same period 
the yield on interest bearing assets has been impacted by the change in the earning asset mix as well as by the decline in market rates 
loans accounted for of all earning assets in while loans accounted for of earning assets in loans accounted for of total assets as of december  compared to as of december  the corporation acquired twelve new branches during through a purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities  affecting deposit growth and to a lessor degree  loan growth 
the two acquisitions resulted in a net cash flow to the corporation of approximately million 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased from million in to million in in september  ctbi took a special charge of million due to conditions that were recognized in in the indirect loan portfolio this portfolio consists primarily of new and used auto loans originated by non affiliated dealers 
six million million of this charge was booked as additional provision for loan losses 
the indirect portfolio had been a continuing problem and this special provision allowed management to expedite the resolution of this issue 
the remaining million was recorded as a write down of the retained interest in the securitization of indirect auto loans 
charge offs  net of recoveries  as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreased from in to in as gross charge offs decreased and recoveries increased for the allowance for loan losses decreased slightly from million at december  to million at december  noninterest income noninterest income increased from million in to million in service charges on deposit related products generated million for the year  an increase of million over the previous year 
this was fueled by the acquisition of approximately million in deposits during and by increasing our collection rates on service charges assessed 
trust income increased from million in to million in as trust assets under management increased during the year 
gains on sale of residential mortgage loans decreased from million in to million in other noninterest income decreased marginally from million in to million in securities gains and losses were not a significant factor in either or  as the corporation incurred net securities gains of  in and neither a gain nor loss in noninterest expense noninterest expense increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily the result of additional operating expenses from the acquisition of the twelve new branches discussed above 
although noninterest expense has increased due to the twelve new branches  there was a decrease in the efficiency ratio from at december  to at december  the deposit to fte ratio increased from million to million year over year 
salaries and employee benefits increased from million in to million in occupancy and equipment expense likewise increased from million in to million in and million in to million in  respectively 
data processing costs increased from million in to million in and stationery and printing costs decreased from million in to million in taxes other than payroll  property  and income  which consists mainly of kentucky franchise taxes on the equity and deposits of the affiliate banks  decreased from million in to million in other categories of noninterest expense remained relatively flat from million in to million in liquidity and market risk the objective of the corporation s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the corporation s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of the corporation s balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity and growth in core deposits 
as of december   the corporation had approximately million in securities and other short term investments maturing or repricing within one year 
additional asset driven liquidity is provided by the remainder of the securities portfolio and the repayment of loans 
these sources  in addition to the corporation s average equity capital base  provide a stable funding base 
in addition to core deposit funding  the corporation also accesses a variety of other short term and long term funding sources 
the corporation also uses the federal home loan bank fhlb as a funding source  with an available credit capacity of million 
the corporation also has significant unused funding capacity in national market certificates of deposit 
the corporation has the availability of two national investment firms both of which have issued commitment letters committing them to market certificates of deposit issued by the corporation in an amount not to exceed of the corporation s total deposits 
management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs 
the corporation began a program of stock repurchase in december with the authorization to acquire up to  shares 
the corporation issued a press release in july announcing its intention to repurchase up to an additional  shares 
during  the corporation continued its stock repurchase program which continues to be accretive to shareholder value 
through this program  the corporation repurchased   and  shares during   and  respectively 
management considers interest rate risk the corporation s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the corporation s net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
the corporation employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the corporation s current interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a basis point immediate and sustained increase or decrease in all interest rates 
the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months given an immediate and sustained basis point increase in the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for the corporation would increase by over one year 
a basis point immediate and sustained decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by over one year 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the corporation has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
periodically  additional assets such as short term commercial loans are also sold 
in and  million and million  respectively  of fixed rate residential mortgages were sold 
in addition in  certain primarily fixed rate  short term commercial loans were sold to a third party 
management focuses its efforts on consistent net interest revenue and net interest margin growth through each of the retail and wholesale business lines 
the corporation does not currently engage in trading activities 
capital resources total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the primary source of capital of the corporation is retained earnings 
cash dividends were per share for and per share for regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the corporation s ratios as of december  were   and  respectively 
community trust bancorp  inc and all banking affiliates met the criteria for well capitalized at december  as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in non monetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations
