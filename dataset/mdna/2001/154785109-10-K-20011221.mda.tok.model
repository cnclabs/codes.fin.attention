item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management contracts management contract revenues consist of management fees both fixed and performance based and fees for ancillary services such as insurance  accounting  equipment leasing  and consulting 
the cost of management contracts includes insurance premiums and claims and other indirect overhead 
the company s responsibilities under a management contract as a facility manager include hiring  training  and staffing parking personnel  and providing collections  accounting  record keeping  insurance  and facility marketing services 
in general  central parking is not responsible under its management contracts for structural  mechanical  or electrical maintenance or repairs  or for providing security or guard services or for paying property taxes 
in general  management contracts are for terms of one to three years and are renewable for successive one year terms  but are cancelable by the property owner on short notice 
with respect to insurance  the company s clients have the option of obtaining liability insurance on their own or having central parking provide insurance as part of the services provided under the management contract 
because of the company s size and claims experience  management believes it can purchase such insurance at lower rates than the company s clients can generally obtain on their own 
accordingly  central parking historically has generated profits on the insurance provided under its management contracts 
leases the company s leases generally require the payment of a fixed amount of rent  regardless of the profitability of the parking facility 
in addition  many leases also require the payment of a percentage of gross revenues above specified threshold levels 
generally speaking  leased facilities require a longer commitment and a larger capital investment to the company and represent a greater risk than managed facilities but provide a greater opportunity for long term growth in revenues and profits 
the cost of parking includes rent  payroll and related benefits  depreciation  maintenance  insurance  and general operating expenses 
under its leases  the company is typically responsible for all facets of the parking operations  including pricing  utilities  and ordinary and routine maintenance  but is generally not responsible for structural  mechanical or electrical maintenance or repairs  or property taxes 
lease arrangements are typically for terms of three to ten years  with a renewal term  and generally provide for increases in base rent based on indices  such as the consumer price index  or on pre determined amounts 
fee ownership ownership of parking facilities  either independently or through joint ventures  typically requires a larger capital investment and greater risk than managed or leased facilities but provides maximum control over the operation of the parking facility and the greatest profit potential of the three types of operating arrangements 
all owned facility revenues flow directly to the company  and the company has the potential to realize benefits of appreciation in the value of the underlying real estate if the property is sold 
the ownership of a parking facility brings the company complete responsibility for all aspects of the property  including all structural  mechanical or electrical maintenance or repairs 
joint ventures the company seeks joint venture partners who are established local or regional developers pursuing financing alternatives for development projects 
joint ventures typically involve a interest in a development where the parking facility is a part of a larger multi use project  allowing the company s joint venture partners to benefit from a capital infusion to the project 
joint ventures offer the revenue growth potential of ownership with a partial reduction in capital requirements 
the company has interests in joint ventures that own or operate parking facilities located throughout the united states as well as mexico  germany  poland  greece and chile 
dbe partnerships central parking is a party to a number of disadvantaged business enterprise partnerships 
these are generally partnerships formed by central parking and a disadvantaged businessperson to manage a facility 
central parking generally owns to of the partnership interests in each partnership and typically receives management fees before partnership distributions are made to the partners 
competition the parking industry is fragmented and highly competitive 
the company faces direct competition for additional facilities to manage  lease  or own and the facilities currently operated by the company face competition for employees and customers 
the company competes with a variety of other companies to add new operations 
although there are relatively few large  national parking companies that compete with the company  developers  hotel companies  and national financial services companies have the potential to compete with parking companies 
municipalities and other governmental entities also operate parking facilities which compete with central parking 
the company also faces competition from regional and local parking companies and from owner operators of facilities who are potential clients for the company s management services 
construction of new parking facilities near the company s existing leased or managed facilities could adversely affect the company s business 
management believes that it competes for clients based on rates charged for services  ability to generate revenues and control expenses for clients  ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes  range and quality of services  and ability to expand operations 
the company believes it has a reputation as a leader in the industry and as a provider of high quality services 
the company also is one of the largest companies in the parking industry and is not limited to a single geographic region 
the company has the financial strength to make capital investments as an owner or joint venture partner that smaller or more leveraged companies cannot make 
the company s size also has allowed it to centralize administrative functions that give the decentralized managerial operations cost efficient support 
moreover  the company has obtained broad experience in managing and operating a wide variety of facilities over the past years 
additionally  the company is able to attract and retain quality managers through its incentive compensation system that directly rewards successful sales and marketing efforts and places a premium on profitable growth 
seasonality the company s business is subject to a modest amount of seasonality 
historically  the company s results have been strongest during the quarters that end on december  and june the company attributes the relative weakness of the quarters that end on march  and september to  among other factors  winter weather and summer vacations 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in future years 
for further discussion of this issue see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
insurance the company purchases comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur at parking facilities it owns  leases or manages 
the primary amount of such coverage is million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per facility 
in addition  the company purchases umbrella excess liability coverage 
the company s various liability insurance policies have deductibles of up to  that must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the company for costs and liabilities relating to covered claims 
as a result  the company is  in effect  self insured for all claims up to the deductible levels 
the company purchases a worker s compensation policy with a per claim deductible of  the company utilizes a third party administrator to process and pay filed claims 
the company also purchases group health insurance with respect to full time company employees  whether such persons are employed at owned  leased  or managed facilities and purchases workers compensation insurance for all employees 
because of the size of the operations covered  the company purchases insurance policies at prices that management believes represent a discount to the prices that would be charged to parking facility owners on a stand alone basis 
pursuant to its management contracts  the company charges its customers for insurance at rates it believes approximate market rates 
in each case  the company s clients have the option of purchasing their own policies  provided the company is named as an additional insured  however  many of the company s clients historically have chosen to purchase such insurance through the company 
a reduction in the number of clients that purchase insurance through the company  however  could have a material adverse effect on the operating earnings of the company 
in addition  a material increase in insurance costs due to an increase in the number of claims  higher claim costs or higher premiums paid by the company could adversely affect the profit associated with insurance charges pursuant to management contracts and could have a material adverse effect on the operating earnings of the company 
regulation the company s business is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  and both municipal and state authorities sometimes directly regulate parking facilities 
the facilities in new york city are  for example  subject to certain governmental restrictions concerning numbers of cars  pricing  and certain prohibited practices 
the company is also affected by laws and regulations such as zoning ordinances that are common to any business that owns real estate and by regulations such as labor and tax laws that affect companies with a large number of employees 
in addition  several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car pooling and the use of mass transit 
the most recent example is the restrictions imposed by the city of new york in the wake of the september terrorist attacks  including a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour 
such laws have adversely affected the company s revenue and could continue to do so in the future 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of parking facilities  the company may be potentially liable for any such costs 
although central parking is currently not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against it  there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against the company 
the cost of defending against claims of liability  or of remediating a contaminated property  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company also is subject to various federal and state antitrust and consumer laws and regulations including the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  which requires filings in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
in connection with the allright merger  central parking and allright entered into a settlement agreement with the antitrust division of the us department of justice which required  among other things  the divestiture of certain parking facilities 
see merger with allright 
various other governmental regulations affect the company s operation of parking facilities  both directly and indirectly  including the americans with disabilities act ada 
under the ada  all public accommodations  including parking facilities  are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
for example  the ada requires parking facilities to include handicapped spaces  headroom for wheelchair vans  attendants booths that accommodate wheelchairs  and elevators that are operable by disabled persons 
management believes that the parking facilities the company owns and operates are in substantial compliance with these requirements 
employees as of september   the company employed approximately  individuals  including  full time and  part time employees 
approximately  us employees are represented by labor unions 
various union locals represent parking attendants and cashiers at the new york city facilities 
other cities in which some of the company s employees are represented by labor unions are washington  dc  miami  philadelphia  san francisco  jersey city  newark  atlantic city  pittsburgh  white plains  san juan  puerto rico  and chicago 
the company frequently is engaged in collective bargaining negotiations with various union locals but has not experienced any labor strikes 
management believes that the company s employee relations are good 
service marks and trademarks the company has registered the names cpc  central parking system and central parking corporation  and its logo with the united states patent office and has the right to use them throughout the united states except in the chicago and atlantic city areas where two other companies have the exclusive right to use the name central parking

item legal proceedings the ownership of property and provision of services to the public entails an inherent risk of liability 
although the company is engaged in routine litigation incidental to its business  there is no legal proceeding to which the company is a party  which  in the opinion of management  will have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
the company carries liability insurance against certain types of claims that management believes meets industry standards  however  there can be no assurance that any pending future legal proceedings including any related judgments  settlements or costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in connection with the merger of allright holdings  inc with a subsidiary of the company  the antitrust division of the united states department of justice the antitrust division filed a complaint in us district court for the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the merger on antitrust grounds 
in addition  the company received notices from several states  including tennessee  texas  illinois  and maryland  that the attorneys general of those states were reviewing the merger from an antitrust perspective 
several of these states also requested certain information relating to the merger and the operations of central parking and allright in the form of civil investigative demands 
central parking and allright entered into a settlement agreement with the antitrust division on march   under which the two companies divested a total of parking facilities in cities  representing approximately  parking spaces 
none of the states that reviewed the transaction from an antitrust perspective became a party to the settlement agreement with the antitrust division

net rent expense decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or

such transaction resulted from the general partner s decision to sell the property as allowed by the partnership agreement 
the company s effective income tax rate before minority interest  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting change was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the rate is primarily attributable to an increase in nondeductible goodwill as a percentage of taxable income 
additionally  the company recorded a one time benefit of approximately million during fiscal relating to the reduction of certain federal and state net operating loss valuation allowances that had been established by allright 
no such benefit was recognized in fiscal management believes that it will be able to utilize these net operating losses to offset future income before their statutory expiration dates as a result of various tax planning strategies that the company implemented during the year

general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in  from in due to the lower payroll costs 
amortization expense of goodwill and non compete agreements increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million

management believes that it will be able to utilize these net operating losses to offset future income before their statutory expiration dates as a result of various tax planning strategies that the company implemented during the year 
quarterly results the company experienced fluctuations in its quarterly net earnings during fiscal due to unusually harsh winter weather in the second quarter and the terrorist attacks in new york city and washington  dc during the fourth quarter resulting in an estimated loss of revenues of million and million  respectively 
both situations had a direct impact on operating earnings due to the relatively fixed nature of the company s cost structure primarily rent and payroll which cannot be readily adjusted for short term declines in parking revenue 
the company also experienced fluctuations in its quarterly net earnings during fiscal due to merger costs incurred in the first and second quarters and the recognition of intermittent property related gains or losses 
additionally  the company has and may continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and related expenses due to acquisitions  pre opening costs  travel and transportation patterns affected by weather and calendar related events  and local and national economic conditions 
the company s concentration of parking facilities in the northeastern and mid atlantic part of the united states  continues to expose the company to the risk of negative financial fluctuations that may result from severe winter weather and other local or regional factors 
additionally  the company services the parking for a number of sports stadiums and arenas and can be impacted by the relative degree of success of various sports teams and strikes 
the following table sets forth certain quarterly statements of earnings data for the eight fiscal quarters preceding the end of the fiscal year and the percentage of net revenues represented by the line items presented except in the case of per share amounts 
the quarterly statement of earnings data set forth below was derived from unaudited financial statements of the company and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  which the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof

also contributing to the decrease in operating cash flow was a reduction in net earnings of million from the prior year 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash of million used in investing activities during fiscal the change primarily resulted from a reduction of million of purchases of property  equipment and leasehold improvements in fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used by financing activities for fiscal was million  a net decrease of million from fiscal the decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in the net amount of repayments of outstanding debt 
the company reduced outstanding debt by million during fiscal repayment of million of notes payable  partially offset by net borrowings of million under its revolving credit agreement and million of notes issued to acquire contract rights compared to net debt repayments of million in fiscal on march   the company established a new credit facility the credit facility providing for an aggregate availability of up to million consisting of a five year million revolving credit facility including a sub limit of million for standby letters of credit  and a million five year term loan 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a grid based margin dependent upon central parking achieving certain financial ratios 
the amount outstanding under the credit facility as of september  was million with a weighted average interest rate of  including the principal amount of the term loan of million which is being repaid in quarterly payments of million through march the credit facility contains covenants including those that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  restrict further indebtedness and limit the amount of dividends paid 
the aggregate availability under the credit facility was million at september   which is net of million of stand by letters of credit 
the credit facility contains covenants including those that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  restrict further indebtedness and limit the amount of dividends paid 
on december   the company entered into an amendment and waiver to the credit facility agreement relating to the waiver of non compliance with certain loan covenants at september  this amendment and waiver contained  among other things  amendment fees of thousand  which are being amortized over the life of the credit facility 
the grid based interest rate margin was not affected by the amendment and continues to be based upon the company achieving certain revised financial ratios 
on february   the company entered into an amendment and restatement to the credit facility agreement primarily to allow the company to repurchase up to million in outstanding shares of its common stock 
this amendment and restatement required the company to pay an amendment fee of thousand  which is being amortized over the life of the credit facility 
interest rates were not affected by this amendment 
the company is required to continue maintaining the aforementioned financial covenants under the credit facility as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to a decline in revenues resulting primarily from the recession and the september tragedy  the company may not be in compliance with one or more of these covenants as of the end of the first or second quarters of fiscal as a result  the company has begun discussions with its lender group regarding potential amendments to its credit facility 
these amendments would  among other things  waive or amend the financial covenants and would likely increase the company s cost of funds under its credit facility by approximately to basis points 
in addition  the company is evaluating several financing alternatives  including sale leaseback opportunities  mortgage financing and repurchase of a portion of its convertible preferred stock 
depending on the timing and magnitude of the company s future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties  joint ventures  or acquisitions  the working capital necessary to satisfy current obligations is anticipated to be generated from operations and central parking s credit facility over the next twelve months 
in the ordinary course of business  central parking is required to maintain and  in some cases  make capital improvements to the parking facilities it operates 
however  as of september   central parking had no material outstanding commitments for capital improvements expenditures 
if central parking identifies investment opportunities requiring cash in excess of central parking s cash flows and the existing credit facility  central parking may seek additional sources of capital  including seeking to amend the credit facility to obtain additional indebtedness 
the allright registration rights agreement  as noted in risk factors  provides certain limitations and restrictions upon central parking s ability to issue new shares of central parking common stock 
until certain shareholders of central parking have received at least million from the sale of central parking common stock in either registered offerings or otherwise  central parking cannot sell any shares of its common stock on its own behalf  subject to certain exceptions 
while central parking does not expect this limitation to affect its working capital needs  it could have an impact on central parking s ability to complete significant acquisitions 
the current market value of central parking common stock also could have an impact on central parking s ability to complete significant acquisitions or raise additional capital 
international foreign currency exposure the company operates wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  canada and spain 
total revenues from wholly owned foreign operations amounted to  and of total revenues for the years ended september   and  respectively 
additionally  the company operates through joint ventures in germany  poland  chile  and mexico 
the company intends to invest in foreign leased or owned facilities  usually through joint ventures  and may become increasingly exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company  in limited circumstances  has denominated contracts in us dollars to limit currency exposure 
presently  the company has limited exposure to foreign currency risk and has no hedge programs related to such risk 
the company anticipates implementing a hedge program if such risk materially increases 
for the year ended september   revenues from the united kingdom and canada operations represented and  respectively  of total revenues generated by foreign operations  excluding earnings from joint ventures 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary sources of revenues to the company are parking revenues from owned and leased locations and management contract revenue net of expense reimbursements on managed parking facilities 
the company believes that inflation has had a limited impact on its overall operations for fiscal years ended september   and new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
established reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under sfas no 
 the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  measured at fair value  in the statement of financial position 
in june  sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
was issued clarifying the accounting for derivatives under the new standard 
on october   the company prospectively adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which resulted in the recording of a net transition loss of thousand  net of related income taxes of thousand  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
further  the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
resulted in the company reducing derivative instrument assets by thousand and recording thousand of derivative instrument liabilities 
at september   the company s derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate caps with a combined notional amount of million and interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of million that effectively convert an equal portion of its debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate 
the company s purpose for holding such instruments is to hedge its exposure to cash flow fluctuations due to changes in market interest rates 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the company adopted sab during the quarter ended march  as a change in accounting principle retroactive to october  adoption of sab required the company to change the timing of recognition of performance based revenues on certain management contracts 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change was a loss of thousand thousand  net of tax as of october  adoption of sab resulted in an increase in management contract revenues of thousand for the year ended september  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria which intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company was required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
immediately 
sfas no 
must be adopted by october   but may be adopted as of october  the company intends to elect this early adoption 
sfas no 
requires that the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas no 
will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of earnings 
as of september   the company s unamortized goodwill amounted to million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets amounted to million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million for each of the years ended september  and because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending december  management does not expect such adoption to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
the company is required and plans to adopt sfas no 
for the quarter ending december  management does not expect such adoption to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under statement is largely unchanged from sfas no

risk factors the failure to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions could have a negative impact on central parking s business and the market price of its common stock 
central parking completed the merger with allright holdings  inc in fiscal in addition  central parking completed two acquisitions subsequent to september   and plans to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
central parking can give no assurance that any acquired facility or company will be successfully integrated into its operations 
also  because of the price paid by central parking or because of the performance of acquired operations after such acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the results of the acquired operations will not be dilutive to central parking s per share earnings 
any acquisition contemplated or completed by central parking may result in adverse short term effects on central parking s reported operating results  divert management s attention  introduce difficulties in retaining  hiring and training key personnel  and introduce risks associated with unanticipated problems or legal liabilities  some or all of which could have a negative effect on central parking s business and financial results 
if the company cannot return to its historical growth rate  the market price of its stock may be adversely affected 
as central parking has expanded its operations  its ability to maintain its historical percentage growth rate has become increasingly difficult 
the merger with allright significantly increased the size of the company  which is likely to reduce the impact of future acquisitions on the results of operations of central parking 
central parking s growth rate also will be directly affected by the increasingly competitive environment for acquisitions of other operators and central parking s ability to obtain suitable financing for acquisitions 
in addition  the growth rate has been and is expected to be affected by the results of operations of added parking facilities  which will depend largely upon central parking s ability to integrate acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that central parking s failure to retain locations or to return to its historical percentage growth rate will not negatively affect the market price of its stock 
if significant shareholders of central parking sell a substantial amount of their stock at the same time  these sales could have an adverse impact on the market price of central parking common stock 
in february  the company filed a registration statement on form s covering  shares of the company s common stock held by certain shareholders of the company 
these shares were registered pursuant to registration rights previously granted to these shareholders 
these shareholders may sell all or a portion of the shares that were registered on any stock exchange  market or trading facility on which the shares are traded  or in private transactions 
if each of these shareholders  or other shareholders who own significant blocks of central parking common stock  sold a substantial amount of central parking common stock  such sales could have a significant negative impact on the stock s market price 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of central parking common stock by monroe carell  chairman of central parking  the carell children s trust and various other carell family trusts and foundations under the allright registration rights agreement or otherwise  could negatively affect the market price of central parking common stock 
monroe carell  jr  the carell children s trust and various other carell family trusts and foundations have certain rights to register shares of central parking common stock under a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the allright merger 
the exercise of these rights and the sale of substantial amounts of stock by monroe carell or other family members  could be perceived negatively by the securities market 
as a result  these sales could adversely affect the market price of central parking common stock 
central parking will be unable to raise money through common stock offerings until it completes its obligations under the allright registration rights agreement 
the allright registration rights agreement provides certain limitations and restrictions upon central parking s ability to issue new shares of central parking common stock 
until certain shareholders of central parking have received at least million from the sale of central parking common stock in either registered offerings or otherwise  central parking cannot sell any shares of its common stock on its own behalf  subject to certain exceptions 
as a result  central parking may not have access to the capital markets for a significant period of time 
there can be no assurance or guarantee that the restrictions upon central parking s ability to raise funds through common stock offerings will not have a negative effect on central parking 
the company s large number of leased and owned facilities increases the risk that the company may not be able to cover the fixed costs of its leased and owned facilities 
the company leased or owned  facilities as of september  although there is more potential for income from leased and owned facilities than from management contracts  they also carry more risk if there is a downturn in property performance or commercial real estate occupancy rates because a significant part of the costs to operate such facilities typically is fixed 
for example  in the case of leases  there are typically minimum lease payments  and in the case of owned facilities  there are the normal risks of ownership and costs of capital 
in addition  maintenance and operating expenses for both leased and owned facilities are borne by central parking and are not passed through to the owner  as is the case with management contracts 
generally  performance of central parking s parking facilities depend  in part  on its ability to negotiate favorable contract terms  its ability to control operating expenses  financial conditions prevailing generally and in areas where parking facilities are located  the nature and extent of competitive parking facilities in the area  weather conditions and the real estate market generally 
we have foreign operations that may be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
central parking operates in the united kingdom  germany  mexico  the republic of ireland  chile  poland  canada  and spain  and intends to expand its business in these and other international locations 
for the year ended september   revenues from foreign operations represented of central parking s total revenues 
the company s united kingdom operations accounted for of such revenues  excluding earnings from joint ventures 
central parking receives revenues and incurs expenses in various foreign currencies in connection with its foreign operations and  as a result  central parking is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
central parking intends to continue to invest in foreign leased or owned parking facilities  either independently or through joint ventures  where appropriate  and may become increasingly exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
presently  central parking has limited exposure to foreign currency risk and anticipates implementing a hedging program if such risk materially increases 
if we increase operations in europe  the euro conversion may adversely affect our business 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and a new currency called the euro 
these countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
until january   the existing sovereign currencies will remain legal tender in these countries 
on january   the euro is scheduled to replace the sovereign legal currencies of these countries 
while the vast majority of central parking s operations within the european union are currently in the united kingdom  a european member which is not scheduled to participate in the euro conversion  central parking has operations in countries which have adopted the euro 
central parking is in the process of assessing the impact of the euro conversion on its operations in the participating countries  including the need to adopt new information technology  parking related equipment and other systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions  as well as the impact to currency risk and contractual relationships 
based on management s assessment of the impact of the euro conversion  central parking does not believe that the euro conversion will have a material impact on its operations or financial condition 
in connection with ownership or operation of parking facilities  we may be potentially liable for environmental problems 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against central parking or against its owned or operated parking facilities 
the cost of defending against claims of liability  or of remediating a contaminated property  could have a negative effect on central parking s business and financial results 
if we cannot maintain positive relationships with labor unions representing our employees  a work stoppage may adversely affect our business 
approximately  employees of central parking are represented by labor unions 
there can be no assurance that central parking will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms 
employees could exercise their rights under the labor union contract  which could include a strike or walk out 
in such cases  there are no assurances that central parking would be able to staff sufficient employees for its short term needs 
any such labor strike or the inability of central parking to negotiate a satisfactory contract upon expiration of the current agreements could have a negative effect on central parking s business and financial results
