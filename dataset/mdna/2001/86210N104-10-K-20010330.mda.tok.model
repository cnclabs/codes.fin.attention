item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we design  manufacture  sell and support fault tolerant enterprise storage solutions that protect and ensure access to an organization s critical data 
our products include high performance  fault tolerant storage subsystems that meet a wide range of customer applications for open systems based networks  such as nt  unix and linux operating systems 
our fault tolerant enterprise storage solutions address all three storage markets direct attached storage das  in which the storage device is connected directly to a server  network attached storage nas  in which the storage device is installed on a network  and storage area network san  in which the storage device is used in a specialized network 
these connectivity options provide our customers the flexibility to choose and deploy a particular storage solution to meet their needs 
as data requirements change  customers can migrate their existing storage investments to different connectivity options 
we believe our products reduce the total cost of ownership of data storage by allowing end users to use the products across various operating systems 
during  we shifted our sales and marketing focus to the development of our direct sales channel from our previous use of alternate channel partners 
our direct sales force concentrates on sales to commercial end users  and the us air force and other federal government end users 
our direct sales force also recruits selected value added resellers vars and assists them in their sales to commercial end users 
during the three years prior to  we had focused our sales and marketing efforts through our primary alternate channel partners  unisys corporation and tandem computers  inc as a result of industry consolidation and competitive factors  sales to unisys and tandem declined significantly in and we do not expect sales to these alternate channel partners to constitute a significant part of our net sales in fiscal in june  we introduced sanstar  a file aware storage architecture intended to unify disparate data  including nas and san 
in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued our sanstar development effort due to emc s purchase of crosstor  the supplier of the real time operating system rtos used in sanstar 
the sanstar product did not account for any revenues but represented a substantial portion of engineering costs in the total amount of sanstar capitalization of  was written down to in december in february  we sold the assets related to the sanstar technology  including certain patent applications  to ciprico  inc for aggregate proceeds of approximately  including of sanstar capitalization 
sales to the us air force accounted for approximately of net sales in although we do not anticipate that the us air force will continue to purchase from us at historical levels  either in absolute dollars or as a percentage of net sales  we believe that sales to the us air force will continue to comprise a significant portion of our net sales 
quarterly fluctuations in sales to the us air force are the result of several factors over which we have no control  including funding appropriations and departmental approvals 
we cannot be certain that our sales to the us air force through federal integrators will not be adversely affected by the investigation discussed in item legal proceedings 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the net sales derived from each of our sales channels year ended december  direct commercial and other federal customers    us air us    indirect alternate channel partners   direct sales include sales through select resellers 
all sales to the us air force are through federal integrators 
federal integrators are government contractors who sell directly to us government entities 
indirect sales include sales through oems and national resellers 
revenue product sales revenue is generally recognized upon product shipment and completion of the order 
periodically  revenue is recognized for product which is being held at the customer s request 
revenue is only recognized on such product when all risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the company has no specific performance obligations remaining 
service revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
revenue related to maintenance contracts is recognized over the respective terms of the maintenance contracts 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue relating to product sales consists primarily of the costs of purchased material  direct labor and related overhead expenses  and amortization and write off of capitalized software 
capitalized software amounts are amortized commencing with product introduction on a straight line basis utilizing the estimated economic life ranging from one to three years 
capitalized software amounts that have no future economic benefit are written down to net realizable value in the period that such value is derived 
the profitability of any particular quarter is significantly affected by the relative sales levels of each of our primary sales channels and types of customers in such quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and travel costs for sales and marketing personnel  including trade shows  and expenses associated with our management  legal  accounting  contract and administrative functions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to software and hardware engineers 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except for software development costs which are capitalized after technological feasibility has been demonstrated 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  direct net sales commercial and other federal customers us air us indirect net sales alternate channel partners total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses research development expenses operating loss income net interest income loss income before extraordinary item and tax benefit extraordinary item benefit for income taxes net loss income our operating results are affected by several factors  particularly the spending fluctuations of our largest customers  including the us air force 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain of our costs  a decline in net sales in any fiscal quarter will have a material adverse effect on that quarter s results of operations 
we do not expect such spending fluctuations to be altered in the foreseeable future

our gross profit in was adversely affected by  and  of charges relating to an increase in inventory obsolescence and the write off of capitalized software  respectively 
the charges taken in for inventory obsolescence relate to the discontinuance of the sanstar development effort and the repositioning of our product offering 
in june  we introduced sanstar  a file aware storage architecture intended to unify disparate data  including nas and san 
in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued our sanstar development effort due to emc s purchase of crosstor  the supplier of the real time operating system rtos used in sanstar 
the sanstar product did not account for any revenues to date but represented a substantial portion of engineering costs which were capitalized in the total amount of sanstar capitalization of  was written down to in december in february  we sold the assets related to the sanstar technology  including certain patent applications  to ciprico  inc for aggregate proceeds of approximately  including of sanstar capitalization

sales to tandem accounted for approximately and of our net sales in and  respectively 
gross profit our gross profit increased by approximately  or  to approximately  in from  in such increase in gross profit is due primarily to the higher level of sales in  coupled with favorable gross margin percentages 
our gross profit percentage increased to in  as compared to in the prior year 
the increase is attributable to the higher proprietary content of product sales  favorable costs attributable to quantity discounts received for third party component products and the lack of one time charges incurred in related to the discontinuation of our efforts to develop a fibre controller and a controller design that incorporated tandem s servernet technology 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in such increase was due primarily to higher commissions associated with higher sales levels 
to a lesser extent  such increase was due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  coupled with enhanced efforts to market our current and new product offerings

net cash used in investing activities was  in net cash used in financing activities was in we used and for the acquisition of equipment by direct purchase during and  respectively 
such expenditures in and primarily consisted of computer equipment associated with our research and development efforts 
there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures currently outstanding 
we had working capital of  and  at december  and  respectively 
on july   we entered into a full recourse factoring facility with bank of america boa  formerly known as nationsbanc commercial corporation  which provides for aggregate advances not to exceed the lesser of  or up to of eligible receivables as defined 
interest on such advances is payable monthly in arrears at the prime lending rate and we are obligated to pay certain annual fees 
the factoring facility is for a period of three years unless terminated by boa by providing us sixty days prior written notice beginning on july  our obligations under such agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   our balance outstanding under this full recourse factoring facility was on june   we signed an amendment to the factoring facility extending the agreement until july   and from year to year thereafter until terminated 
except as referenced above  the factoring facility remains unchanged 
our ability to borrow under a  general line of credit with the finova group  inc finova has been terminated 
the agreement with finova contained covenants relating to net worth  total assets to debt and total inventory to debt 
our obligations under the agreement with finova were collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
during  finova temporarily increased the general line of credit to  through january   on the same terms and conditions 
on january   the amount of the line was returned to  and the line was extended through january  on april   the line of credit extended to us by finova was permanently increased by  raising the total amount of funds available to us under the finova general line of credit to  in december  finova terminated our credit facility with them 
during and we used our general line of credit with finova to augment our purchasing ability with various vendors 
as of december  and  we had and outstanding under this credit line  respectively 
during  we utilized  of net operating loss carryover nol for federal tax purposes 
as of december   we have nol carryovers for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which will begin to expire in we also have research and development tax credit carryovers for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which will begin to expire in in addition  we have alternative minimum tax credits of approximately  which can be carried forward indefinitely 
we experienced a change in ownership in and in as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  future use of these nols and income tax credits will be limited 
as of december   we have approximately  of state nol carryforwards which will begin to expire in and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of in december  we sold  of state nol carryforwards and of state research and development tax credits which resulted in a tax benefit of under sfas no 
 a valuation allowance is established  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been provided to offset our net deferred tax assets 
we will periodically reassess the valuation allowance 
on november   we sought shareholder approval for the issuance of up to  shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock series a to raise up to an aggregate of  of gross proceeds 
the shareholder meeting was originally scheduled for november   and was adjourned twice by the company to december  in order to give shareholders the maximum opportunity to vote 
the company was unable  however  to obtain the requisite quorum to conduct a meeting within the statutory maximum sixty day period 
as the record date for the shareholder meeting was october   the last day we could hold the meeting was december  the company did obtain the sufficient votes on the st day  or december  of those shareholders responding  an overwhelming approved the proposed transaction 
since the quorum was achieved past the date of the statutory maximum  we believe it was necessary to apply to nasdaq for an exception to shareholder approval 
on january   we applied for an exception to nasdaq marketplace rule i requiring the company to receive shareholder approval of an equity financing when such financing would result in a change of control of the issuer 
on february   nasdaq determined that an exception from the shareholder approval requirement was warranted subject to the company mailing to all shareholders  no later than ten days before the completion of the financing  a letter describing the proposed transaction and alerting shareholders to the company s omission to seek the shareholder approval that would otherwise be required 
the letter was required to indicate that the audit committee of the board had expressly approved the exception 
in addition  the company was required to issue a press release describing the transaction 
on march   we issued  shares of our cumulative convertible preferred stock  series a the series a preferred stock to accredited investors for an aggregate gross proceeds equal to  pursuant to a private equity placement the private placement 
the series a preferred stock has a cumulative coupon and is initially convertible into our common stock on an for basis 
the series a preferred stock also has liquidation and dividend preferences superior to those of existing stockholders 
the purchasers of series a preferred stock also acquired certain anti dilution and registration rights 
no underwriter was employed by us in connection with the issuance of the securities in the private placement  however ce unterberg  towbin unterberg towbin acted as our placement agent 
as compensation for its services  unterberg towbin received a fee equal to  shares of series a preferred stock  in addition to payment of certain expenses if fully sold 
thomas i 
unterberg  a former director of the company  along with certain affiliates of mr 
unterberg  purchased  shares of series a preferred stock on the same terms and conditions as all other purchasers 
mr 
unterberg also is chairman  managing director and member of the executive committee of unterberg towbin 
in june  we introduced sanstar  a file aware storage architecture intended to unify disparate data  including nas and san 
in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued our sanstar development effort due to emc s purchase of crosstor  the supplier of the real time operating system rtos used in sanstar 
the sanstar product did not account for any revenues but represented a substantial portion of engineering costs in the total amount of sanstar capitalization of  was written down to in december in february  we sold the assets related to the sanstar technology  including certain patent applications  to ciprico  inc for aggregate proceeds of approximately  including of sanstar capitalization 
on january   we received notification from nasdaq that our common stock had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of per share for the thirty days prior to the date of notification 
we have days from the notice date to regain compliance by having the bid price for our common stock close at or greater for a minimum period of consecutive trading days 
as of march   we have not regained compliance 
in the event that we do not regain compliance  we will be subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market and would trade on the otc bulletin board 
a delisting from nasdaq national market may have an adverse effect on our stock price and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity 
in response to competitive and financial pressures  during the first quarter of  we reduced our workforce by up to across most departments 
additionally  our executive officers have agreed to salary reductions 
as a result of the changes we made to our workforce  we have incurred a onetime charge in the first quarter of of approximately  however  we believe that our restructured workforce will help reduce operating expenses in our operating results are affected by seasonal factors  particularly the spending fluctuations of our largest customers including the us air force through federal integrators 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain of our costs  a decline in net sales in any fiscal quarter will have a material adverse effect on that quarter s results of operations 
we do not expect such spending fluctuations to be altered in the future 
a significant reduction in orders from any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to place orders with us or that orders of our customers will continue at their previous levels 
subject to the risks discussed in this annual report on form k  we believe that our existing available cash  credit facilities  proceeds from the private placement described above and the cash flow expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our operating results will achieve profitability or adequate cash flow in the next twelve months 
our operating plan contains assumptions regarding revenue and expenses 
the achievement of the operating plan depends heavily on the timing of sales and our ability to gain new customers and make additional sales to current customers 
the continuation of operating losses  together with the risks associated with our business  and other changes in our operating assets and liabilities  may have a material adverse affect on the our future liquidity 
inability to improve operating results may require us to seek equity financing  which  if required  would cause dilution to our current stockholders 
if needed  there can be no assurance that we can obtain equity financing  if at all  on terms acceptable to us
