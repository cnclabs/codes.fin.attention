item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below under the headings recent developments  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this annual report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item business considerations  may affect our actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
we have adopted a strategy intended to focus on our core space technology business units 
this strategy includes the disposition of certain non core assets 
subsequent to december   we adopted a formal plan to dispose of magellan corporation magellan  which designs  produces  distributes  sells and licenses satellite access products  and our investment in navigation solutions llc navsol  a joint venture engaged in satellite aided automotive guidance and related value added information services 
accordingly  magellan s financial results are no longer included in our operational results and our equity interest in navsol is no longer included in our earnings losses of affiliates for the year ended december  and prior years  but are now reported as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a  loss from discontinued operations  including an estimated  loss on the planned disposition of magellan s and navsol s net assets 
we own substantially all the common stock of orbital imaging corporation orbimage 
we exercise significant influence over orbimage s operational and financial affairs  but we do not control such affairs 
we use the equity method of accounting for our ownership interest in orbimage 
we also accounted for our investment in orbcomm global lp orbcomm using the equity method of accounting through the second quarter of we held an approximately limited partnership interest in orbcomm as of december  we recognized of the revenues earned and costs incurred on sales of products and services to orbcomm and orbimage 
we eliminated our share of profits from these sales to the extent these entities were capitalizing system construction costs 
as a result of the weakened financial condition of orbcomm and orbimage  however  we stopped recognizing revenues on sales to orbcomm and orbimage effective june and july  respectively 
in september  orbcomm and its subsidiaries commenced a reorganization proceeding under chapter of the us federal bankruptcy code 
accordingly  we recorded non cash charges totaling  in to fully write off our investment in orbcomm and to write down orbcomm related receivables and related inventories 
although management believes at this time that these write offs are sufficient to cover our current exposure  such reserves do not include any additional charges to orbital that might result should any disputes  litigation or unforeseen contingencies related to orbcomm arise 
recent developments x program since  we have been developing  constructing and testing several x reusable rocketplanes under a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa 
nasa terminated this contract for convenience in march we determined that our estimated future cash flows from x related plant  property and equipment would not be sufficient to recover the recorded cost 
accordingly  we recorded an asset impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of to write down x related property  plant and equipment to their estimated realizable values 
we also recorded a  provision for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable recorded as selling  general and administrative expense 
while we are seeking to recover from nasa a significant portion of our costs associated with the x contract  there can be no assurance that such a recovery will occur on a timely basis  if at all 
sale of mda shares on april   our wholly owned subsidiary  mda holdings inc mda holdings  which holds our shares in macdonald  dettwiler and associates ltd 
mda  entered into an agreement with a group of canadian institutional and private equity investors to sell  shares for approximately per share before fees and expenses 
the agreement is subject to customary closing conditions  including the receipt of regulatory approvals  and the parties expect to close the sale by mid may certain of the purchasers also have an option to acquire mda holdings remaining  shares of mda by may  results of operations for the years ended december   and our products and services are grouped into four reportable segments i launch vehicles and advanced programs  ii satellites and related space systems  iii electronics and sensor systems  and iv space robotics  satellite ground systems  and mapping and land information products and services 
all other activities of the company are reported in corporate and other 
as noted previously  for all periods  the financial information for magellan and navsol has been reflected as discontinued operations 
revenues our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for and  for consolidated revenues in  and included approximately   and  respectively  from sales to orbcomm and orbimage 
the following table summarizes revenues from our business segments years ended december  in thousands launch vehicles and advanced programs    satellites and related space systems    electronics and sensor systems    space robotics  satellite ground systems  and mapping and land information products and services    corporate and other  total    revenues from launch vehicles and advanced programs decreased significantly from to primarily due to the suspension of revenue recognition under the company s procurement agreements with orbcomm and orbimage  as discussed previously 
additionally  revenues from the x program declined in due to a decrease in the percentage of the contract completed in as compared to the decrease in revenues from to related primarily to customer induced launch schedule delays by our government customers and slowed demand from our commercial customers 
revenues from satellites and related space systems decreased significantly from to primarily due to the suspension of revenue recognition under the company s procurement agreements with orbcomm and orbimage and the cancellation of a major satellite construction contract in the fourth quarter of by a canadian customer because of difficulties in obtaining the necessary us government export authorizations 
additionally  revenues from a commercial geosynchronous satellite contract declined in due to a decrease in the percentage of the contract completed in as compared to the increase in satellite revenues from to was due  in part  to revenues recognized from a commercial geosynchronous satellite contract on which work commenced in  offset  in part  by reduced revenues resulting from estimated contract cost increases on certain satellite contracts in revenues from electronics and sensor systems decreased in as compared to primarily due to the sale of our fairchild defense electronics business unit fairchild in october the decrease in revenues was largely offset by an increase in transportation management systems revenues under existing and new contracts 
the increase in electronics and sensor systems revenues from to was primarily due to defense electronics contract awards in early  as well as to an increase in transportation management systems revenues primarily as a result of the december acquisition of raytheon company s raytheon transportation management systems business 
revenues from space robotics  satellite ground systems  and mapping and land information products and services increased significantly from to primarily as a result of mda s acquisition of the dataquick products division of acxiom corporation dataquick in april  a full year of revenues attributable to our space robotics business and the bc online license  both of which were acquired in may  and orders received in late for several satellite ground systems and system upgrades 
the increase in revenues in space robotics  satellite ground systems  and mapping and land information products and services in as compared to was attributable to the acquisition of our space robotics product line in  which accounted for  of the revenues for this segment 
gross profit costs of goods sold gross profits and margins depend on a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
costs of goods sold include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead related to commercial products and to costs incurred under various development and production contracts 
gross profits and margins by business segment were as follows years ended december  gross of gross of gross of profit revenue profit revenue profit revenue in thousands launch vehicles and advanced programs    satellites and related space systems    electronics and sensor systems    space robotics  satellite ground systems  and mapping and land information products and services    corporate and other total    gross margins for launch vehicles and advanced programs increased significantly from to primarily due to more efficient execution of several launch vehicle contracts  improved margins on the x contract and a  settlement on the closeout of a contract with nasa relating to one of our early launch vehicle products 
in addition  gross margins were negatively impacted by a  write down in to costs of goods sold relating to certain software and inventory produced under a contract that was cancelled in gross margins for this segment decreased between and primarily due to the write down described above  as well as cost increases on certain advanced launch vehicle contracts principally occurring in the fourth quarter of gross margins for satellites and related space systems decreased significantly from to primarily due to significant cost growth on a large number of our satellite construction programs 
the cost growth is primarily associated with schedule delays resulting from non recurring design and production activities on geosynchronous and remote sensing satellite construction contracts 
the estimated costs to complete these programs exceed the applicable contract values and  accordingly  we recorded provisions in with respect to the anticipated losses 
as these contracts are in a loss position  they will not contribute to gross margins in profit margins in this product line decreased significantly from to primarily as a result of a change in the mix of satellite contracts to include lower margin geosynchronous satellite contracts and cost growth on certain other satellite contracts 
gross margins for electronics and sensor systems decreased from to primarily due to the sale of our higher margin fairchild unit in october  as well as to lower margins attributable to cost growth on certain transportation management system contracts 
in addition  we recorded a provision for costs related to the termination of a transportation management systems contract in the third quarter of  which also contributed to the decline in gross margins for this business segment 
profit margins in this product line decreased from to primarily as a result of a change in the mix of contracts following the december acquisition of raytheon s transportation management systems product line 
gross margins for space robotics  satellite ground systems  and mapping and land information products and services increased slightly from to  primarily due to the april acquisition of dataquick  which is a higher margin land information products business  offset in part by lower margin work on space robotics contracts and on several ground system contracts 
gross margins for this product line decreased from to primarily as a result of sales of lower margin land information products and services and an increase in the amount of lower margin subcontract work on several ground systems contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include our self funded product development activities and exclude direct customer funded development 
research and development expenses for  and were  of revenues  of revenues and  of revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses relate primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and new satellite and robotics systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses as well as the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  of revenues   of revenues and  of revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to an accrual in for projected facility sublease losses  provisions for x and orbimage related receivables  expenses associated with mda s acquisition activity and higher professional services fees 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to is attributable to the expansion of our business and the acquisition of product lines and businesses 
provision for doubtful orbcomm accounts as a result of orbcomm s chapter filing  we recorded a  charge to write down orbcomm receivables to their estimated realizable value 
asset impairments as noted previously  we recorded an asset impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of to write down x related property  plant and equipment to their estimated realizable values 
in december  we determined that the carrying value of a specialized voice communications satellite system that we constructed and launched would no longer be recoverable through the expected future sales of the related products or services 
we recorded a  asset impairment charge with respect to this asset in the fourth quarter of interest expense interest cost  before deducting capitalized interest  was   and  for  and  respectively 
we capitalized interest costs totaling   and  in  and  respectively 
interest expense increased in as a result of higher average borrowings and higher interest rates 
interest expense increased in from primarily due to an increase in debt outstanding and a decision to stop capitalizing interest on our investment in orbcomm when it began commercial operations at the end of interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  includes interest earnings on short term investments and realized gains and losses on investments 
interest income and other  net was   and  for  and  respectively 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates were as follows years ended december  in thousands orbcomm    orbimage    cci and other   in the second half of  we wrote off our remaining  investment in orbcomm 
orbcomm s losses increased in as compared to due to i higher operating expenses relating to the rollout of global commercial services  ii increased interest expense and iii increased system depreciation expense 
orbcomm stopped capitalizing interest and began depreciating its full satellite constellation in the fourth quarter of we eliminated our proportionate share of profits on sales to orbcomm based on our partnership interest 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates includes orbital s share of orbimage s losses  including preferred stock dividends 
in the first half of  we recognized equity losses totaling  until our investment balance was reduced to zero 
we then suspended recognition of additional orbimage losses when we determined that we would not provide additional equity funding to orbimage 
during the first quarter of  as a result industry and market conditions we reconsidered our intentions regarding potential future investments of additional capital to orbimage 
as a result  we commenced recognizing orbimage s losses in the fourth quarter of  including  of orbimage s losses not previously recognized through december  we also eliminate our share of profits on sales to orbimage 
in  we acquired an equity interest in  and entered into a satellite procurement contract with  cci international  nv cci  a start up satellite voice communications provider 
we had an investment in cci of  at december  we provided substantially all of cci s funding in accordingly  we did not recognize any revenue in connection with our satellite contract with cci and we recognized all of cci s losses 
we concluded in that our investment in cci was impaired and recorded a non cash charge of  in to write off our investment in cci 
minority interests minority interests in earnings losses of consolidated subsidiaries were   and  in  and  respectively 
substantially all of the minority interest charge in is attributable to the minority stockholders proportionate share of mda s net income for mda was a wholly owned subsidiary until late december substantially all of the minority interest in and is attributable to the minority shareholders proportionate share of the losses of an orbcomm related partnership that we consolidated in and litigation settlement in july  we reached an agreement to settle the outstanding class action lawsuit filed in alleging violations of federal securities laws 
the settlement agreement provides for the plaintiffs to receive a cash payment of  to be made by our insurance carrier  and warrants to be issued by us in  which had an aggregate fair value of  as of the settlement date 
accordingly  we accrued a litigation settlement provision of  in the second quarter of gains on sales of assets and subsidiary equity on october   we sold fairchild for approximately  in cash and realized a  gain 
in july  mda completed an initial public offering on the toronto stock exchange of  shares of common stock  raising gross proceeds of approximately  for itself   for orbital and  for other selling shareholders 
we recorded a  gain on this transaction 
in december  mda issued common stock in a private placement and immediately provided to us a dividend of  in gross proceeds  resulting in a one time gain of approximately   net of taxes  fees and expenses 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of   and  in  and  respectively 
in  due to the continuing losses from operations and consideration of anticipated future results  it was determined that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against the us deferred tax assets  resulting in an expense of  the remaining provision and the provision were due to foreign taxes attributable to our canadian operations  as well as a tax charge of  associated with the sale of mda s common stock in as of december   we had provided a  valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are used to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
discontinued operations in the first quarter of  the company adopted a formal plan to dispose of magellan and our investment in navsol 
accordingly  a  loss from discontinued operations was recorded in  including an estimated  loss on the planned disposition of magellan s and navsol s net assets 
the loss on the disposal includes  for projected operating losses through the end of the second quarter of  by which time we expect to have completed the disposition 
liquidity and capital resources during  we funded our capital requirements for operations through cash from operations combined with cash on hand and the proceeds from the disposition of certain of our mda shares and fairchild 
our liquidity has been  and continues to be  constrained and we anticipate that in cash flow from operations will be insufficient to cover our capital requirements  operating requirements and debt service 
to meet our capital and operating requirements  we have entered into an agreement to sell  of our mda shares  at approximately per share 
the agreement is subject to customary closing conditions  including receipt of regulatory approvals  and the parties expect to close the sale by mid may certain of the purchasers also have an option to acquire mda holdings remaining  shares of mda by may  further  we are negotiating to sell our interests in magellan and navsol  which we consider to be non core assets 
management s plans also include restructuring business operations  which  combined with the above described asset sales should facilitate our ability to raise additional equity capital and refinance our debt 
we also intend to explore sales of additional non core assets 
management expects that this strategy will generate sufficient additional liquidity to satisfy our obligations  however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in achieving such goal 
our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon our success in implementing the foregoing strategy on a timely basis  and we are accordingly focusing our near term efforts on executing certain asset sales and restructuring our business operations 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of   and  respectively 
the company expects to incur a net loss in before considering gains or losses from any asset sales 
as of december   we had  of unrestricted cash and short term investments 
our accumulated deficit was  as of december  current liabilities exceed current assets by  at december  we invested  in capital expenditures for various satellites  launch vehicles and other infrastructure production  manufacturing and test equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements and office equipment in during  our continuing operations provided net cash of  and net cash used to fund discontinued operations was  cash and investments were  and total debt obligations were  at december  orbital s outstanding debt at december  included  convertible subordinated notes due   outstanding under our primary credit facility the primary facility which is discussed below   of short term debt of magellan that was guaranteed by us   borrowed by mda under its credit facility which is non recourse to us   outstanding under our secured note with the northwestern mutual life insurance company  and other unsecured notes and asset based financings 
cash and investments at december  included approximately  restricted to support bank covenants and outstanding letters of credit 
our current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities was 
and 
at december  and  respectively 
our ratio of total debt less cash and investments to total debt plus total stockholders equity was approximately at december  as compared to at december  our primary facility is with an international syndicate of banks and provided for total borrowings of  all of which was drawn and outstanding as of december   at a weighted average interest rate of 
the primary facility had mandatory prepayment requirements to reduce the total amount outstanding 
we satisfied these requirements in when we paid down  with proceeds from the sale of mda shares in the third quarter of and  with proceeds from the sale of fairchild in the fourth quarter of on february   we entered into a  day loan the secondary facility with this bank syndicate 
at that same time  we amended and restated the primary facility the amended and restated primary facility in order to  among other things  modify the prepayment terms  expand the collateral provided to the banks and change the expiration date from december to july our borrowings are now collateralized by accounts receivable  intellectual property  inventory  equipment  real estate and certain other assets  including the stock of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  which include mda holdings  the holder of all shares of mda that we beneficially own 
the amended and restated primary facility and the secondary facility prohibit the payment of cash dividends and the making of investments  and contain certain covenants with respect to our working capital levels  operating cash flows  leverage and net worth 
during the first quarter of  we defaulted under several financial covenants dealing with minimum consolidated net worth  consolidated leverage and senior leverage under both the amended and restated primary facility and the secondary facility 
these defaults were waived by the bank group in amendments signed in april the amended and restated primary facility and the secondary facility require that we reduce outstanding balances under the facilities in connection with debt issuances  equity issuances or asset sales consummated by us 
we must apply of the first  of net cash proceeds from any asset sale  of the next  and thereafter to pay down amounts owing under the secondary facility first  and then the amended and restated primary facility 
in addition  we must apply of net cash proceeds from any debt issuances and of the net cash proceeds of any equity issuance by us to pay down the facilities 
we will default under the leverage covenant in both the secondary facility and the amended and restated primary facility unless we complete asset sales by june  that raise sufficient proceeds to pay down a significant portion of debt 
in june  we made a scheduled payment of principal on our note payable to northwestern mutual life insurance company  reducing the outstanding balance from  to approximately  the remaining balance matures in june we also agreed that the interest rate on the balance of the note would be retroactively increased if we did not prepay the note 
we have not prepaid the note and  accordingly  at december   the interest rate on this note increased to 
in january  we also agreed to make pro rata payments under this note at the time payments are made to our lenders under the amended and restated primary facility in connection with asset sales  equity issuances or debt issuances 
in august  magellan amended its credit facility with silicon valley bank 
in connection with the amendment  we guaranteed payment of amounts owed by magellan 
in the first quarter of  we paid silicon valley bank  under the guarantee in order to avoid a default by magellan on its tangible net worth covenant 
mda has a credit facility with a syndicate of six banks  which is non recourse to us 
the facility provides for total availability of approximately  of which approximately  was outstanding at december  and contains certain operational and financial covenants including certain restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the total available amount includes a program specific letter of credit facility of  in july  mda completed an initial public offering on the toronto stock exchange of  shares of common stock  raising gross proceeds of approximately  for itself   for us and  for other selling shareholders 
our ownership interest in mda declined to approximately as of december  as a result of the public offering 
in october  we sold fairchild for approximately  in addition to paying down  on our primary facility as described above  we repaid approximately  of debt that had been secured by assets of fairchild  and have used the balance to fund general operations 
during the second quarter of  we agreed to temporarily refund  to orbimage in january from amounts previously paid by orbimage under its procurement agreement with us  provided  however  that such obligation would be terminated if we were to successfully broker a renegotiation of orbimage s license agreement for worldwide radarsat satellite distribution rights with mda 
the existing radarsat agreement was terminated in february and replaced by a new agreement between mda and orbimage for exclusive us radarsat distribution rights 
we believe that as a result  our obligation to temporarily refund  was extinguished 
notwithstanding the renegotiation of the license agreement  orbimage has notified us of its position that the  refund is now due and payable  which we dispute 
the parties are in discussion to resolve this matter 
under the new radarsat license agreement   will be due from orbimage in we have agreed to purchase up to  of receivables from orbimage in  subject to certain conditions  if orbimage is unable to make its payments to mda 
orbimage management currently estimates that orbimage has sufficient resources to meet its capital and operating requirements through may in march  due to a delay in the orbview launch  we paid  to orbimage as partial payment of a  launch delay penalty that is otherwise due in may orbimage is seeking to restructure its outstanding debt  which is non recourse to us  and to obtain additional capital from third parties as well as its existing shareholders 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on a timely basis or at all 
as a result of orbimage s weakened financial condition  we ceased recognizing revenues on the orbimage system procurement contract during the third quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any material exposure to interest rate changes  commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuation or similar market risks  although we do enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against specific foreign currency fluctuations  principally with respect to the canadian dollar and japanese yen 
at december   the majority of the company s long term debt consisted of its  convertible subordinated notes due the fair market value of these convertible securities fluctuates with the company s stock price and was  at december  the company has a deferred compensation plan for senior managers and executive officers  with a total liability balance of  at december   based on the market value of the investments elected by the plan participants 
this liability is subject to fluctuation based upon the market value of underlying securities
