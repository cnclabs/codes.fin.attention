background and overview we are a provider of private  for profit postsecondary education with campuses throughout the united states and in canada  the united kingdom and the united arab emirates 
we have approximately  students enrolled as of january  and our schools enjoy long operating histories and offer a variety of master s degree  bachelor s degree  associate degree  and diploma programs in career oriented disciplines within our core curricula of 
visual communication and design technologies 
information technology 
business studies 
culinary arts we have experienced significant growth both internally and through acquisitions 
we have invested significant amounts of capital in the hiring of additional personnel and increased marketing and capital improvements at each of the schools we have acquired 
the increased costs of personnel and marketing are expensed as incurred and are reflected in general and administrative expenses 
additional depreciation is a result of capital improvements and increased amortization is a result of added goodwill 
we have experienced significant growth both internally and through acquisitions with our net revenue increasing from million in to million in in addition  our net income increased from million in to million in in addition  we believe that ebitda  while not a substitute for generally accepted accounting principles measures of operating results  is an important measure of our financial performance and that of our schools 
for the year ended december   ebitda was million  up percent from million for we believe that ebitda is particularly meaningful due principally to the role acquisitions have played in our development 
our rapid growth through acquisitions has resulted in significant non cash depreciation and amortization expense  because a significant portion of the purchase price of a school acquired by us is generally allocated to fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of our ongoing acquisition strategy  non cash amortization expense may continue to be substantial 
our principal source of revenue is tuition collected from our students 
the academic year is at least weeks in length  but varies both by individual school and program of study 
the academic year is divided by term  which is determined by start dates  which vary by school and program 
payment of each term s tuition may be made by full cash payment  financial aid and or an installment payment plan 
if a student withdraws from school prior to the completion of the term  we refund the portion of tuition already paid which is attributable to the period of the term that is not completed 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the student s program  and is reflected net of bad debt expense 
our campuses charge tuition at varying amounts  depending not only on the particular school  but also upon the type of program and the specific curriculum 
on average  our campuses increase tuition one or more times annually 
other revenue consists of bookstore sales  placement fees  contract training  dormitory and cafeteria fees  rental income  and restaurant revenue 
other revenue is recognized during the period services are rendered 
educational services and facilities expense includes costs directly attributable to the educational activity of our schools  including salaries and benefits of faculty  academic administrators and student support personnel 
educational services and facilities expense also includes costs of educational supplies and facilities including rents on school leases  distance learning costs  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories  costs of student housing and owned facility costs 
general and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits of personnel in recruitment  admissions  accounting  personnel  compliance and corporate and school administration 
costs of promotion and development  advertising and production of marketing materials  and occupancy of the corporate offices are also included in this expense category 
depreciation and amortization includes costs associated with the depreciation of purchased computer laboratories  equipment  furniture and fixtures  courseware  owned facilities  capitalized equipment leases and amortization of intangible assets  primarily goodwill and non competition agreements with the previous owners of our schools

net income attributable to common stockholders increased from million in to million in the primary reason for this increase was due to the increase in net income discussed above and decreases in dividends on preferred stock and accretion to redemption value of preferred stock and warrants in connection with our initial public offering 
seasonality our results of operations fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment at our schools 
our schools experience a seasonal increase in new enrollments in the fall  traditionally when the largest numbers of new high school graduates begin postsecondary education 
furthermore  although we encourage year round attendance at all schools  some schools have summer breaks for some of their programs 
as a result of these factors  total student enrollment and net revenue are typically highest in the fourth quarter  which is october through december  and lowest in the second quarter  which is april through june  of our fiscal year 
our costs and expenses do not  however  fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis  except for admissions and advertising costs as these are typically higher in the second and third quarter in support of seasonally high enrollments 
we anticipate that these trends will continue 
liquidity and capital resources on may   we sold  shares of common stock at per share pursuant to a public offering 
the net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of common stock  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us  were approximately million

there were approximately million edutrek shares outstanding 
we finance our operating activities and our internal growth through cash generated from operations 
we finance acquisitions through funding from a combination of additional equity issuances  credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in from million in the decrease was partially due to approximately million in severance costs and other liabilities related to acquisitions 
additionally  we paid approximately million more in tax payments than in as a result of our increased profitability 
capital expenditures increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to investments in leasehold improvements on new and expanded facilities and investments in capital equipment as a result of increasing student population 
we expect capital expenditures to continue to increase as new schools are acquired or opened  student population increases and current facilities and equipment are upgraded and expanded 
our net receivables as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in due to the increase in student population and higher priced programs and increased revenues at schools acquired during based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
when a student withdraws  the receivable balance attributable to such student is charged to this allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical bad debt expense as a percentage of gross student revenue for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
on march   we amended our credit agreement dated october  to increase our line of credit from million to million 
we may now obtain letters of credit up to million 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the revolving credit facility availability under our credit agreement 
our credit agreement matures on october  under the credit agreement our borrowings bear interest  payable quarterly  at either the bank s base or prime rate depending on whether the particular loan is denominated in us or canadian dollars  plus a specified number of basis points  ranging from to  based upon our leverage ratio or libor  plus a specified number of basis points  ranging from to based upon our leverage ratio 
under the credit agreement  we are required  among other things  to maintain financial ratios with respect to debt to ebitda and interest coverage and a specified level of net worth 
we are also subject to limitations on  among other things  payment of dividends  disposition of assets and incurrence of additional indebtedness

the doe requires that we keep unbilled title iv program funds that are collected in separate cash accounts until the students are billed for the program portion related to those title iv program funds 
in addition  all funds transferred to our schools through electronic funds transfer program are held in a separate cash account until certain conditions are satisfied 
as of december   we held nominal amounts of such funds in separate accounts 
the restrictions on any cash held in these accounts have not significantly affected our ability to fund daily operations 
recent accounting pronouncement on december   the securities exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  to provide guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the sab outlines basic criteria that must be met before registrants may recognize revenue  including persuasive evidence of the existence of an arrangement  the delivery of products or services  a fixed and determinable sales price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
sab became effective beginning the first fiscal quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after december  prior to the release of sab  our revenue recognition policy was in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
effective january   we adopted this change in accounting principle to comply with the specific provisions and guidance of sab sab requires us to recognize revenue related to application and registration fees over the student benefit period 
through december   we recognized application and registration fees as revenue upon receipt 
as a result  we recognized a cumulative net of tax charge of million  in the first quarter of this new accounting requirement did not have a significant effect on income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended by sfas  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement requires that all derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap contract and foreign exchange contracts  be recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them 
changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in income or shareholder s equity as a component of comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash flow 
we do not currently hold or issue any derivative financial instruments  but will adopt sfas if this becomes applicable in the future
