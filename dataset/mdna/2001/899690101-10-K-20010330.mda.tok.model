item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a leading provider of mission critical messaging solutions that enable organizations to manage and secure online business communications and processes 
our customers use our solutions to centrally control and monitor the corporate communications stream to comply with policies and government regulations  communicate securely with business partners  suppliers and customers  and to integrate business communications and processes online 
tumbleweed software creates a foundation for automated legacy data extraction  preparation and secure two way communication of sensitive or confidential business information  such as electronic statements and customer service inquiries 
tumbleweed solutions integrate with existing systems and end user behavior 
tumblweed solutions are centrally controlled by it managers while remaining transparent to end users who do not need to deploy new software or behavior to comply with corporate security and communications policies 
in  our product offerings included the tumbleweed messaging management system mms  a comprehensive solution for enforcing corporate e mail usage policies and protecting information as it travels over the internet  mms web filter  which provides organizations with the ability to control internet usage and to monitor and control submissions to internet message boards and web based e mail services  mms message monitor  which includes enterprise archiving and a web based reviewer tool that enable an organization to copy all or selected messages to an external storage medium  tumbleweed secure redirect  which provides a secure delivery channel directly from the desktop based on communications policies defined in mms that are transparent to the end user  and tumbleweed integrated messaging exchange ime  which combines an advanced software platform and customized applications to establish an internet communication channel between a business and its customers  suppliers  and partners 
we announced the discontinuation of two products in april worldsecure client  an s mime encryption plug in for microsoft outlook  lotus notes r  and eudora pro  and nettalk  an intranet messaging and directory server that provides directory synchronization and acts as a directory switch between disparate e mail systems 
on january   we completed the acquisition of worldtalk communications corporation worldtalk  a leading provider of internet security and policy management solutions that enable organizations to define and manage e mail and web security usage policies to manage the risks and liabilities associated with internet communications 
the business combination has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  our historical financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of worldtalk 
except as otherwise indicated  the terms tumbleweed  we and our refer to tumbleweed and its subsidiaries  including worldtalk  in this discussion 
on september   we completed the acquisition of interface systems  inc interface 
interface s legacy to internet  or li  products and services simplify the process of transforming and using data found in legacy computer systems into electronic content that is easy to distribute and use online 
the li products adapt legacy print streams and other data types to the internet and intelligently convert them into formats such as portable document format  hypertext markup language or extensible markup language for use online 
the combination of li with tumbleweed ime gives our customers a comprehensive  end to end solution for electronic statement presentment 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
since september   interface s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the intangible assets was determined based upon a valuation using a combination of methods  including a cost approach for the assembled workforce  and an income approach for the core technology 
the purchase price of approximately million consisted of an exchange of  shares of the company s common stock with a fair value of approximately million  assumed stock options with a fair value of approximately million  cash paid of million  and other acquisition related expenses of approximately million consisting primarily of payments for financial advisor and other professional fees 
our historical revenue consists of i license revenue  ii services revenue and iii transaction revenue 
license revenue consists of initial license fees and the sale of distribution rights 
license revenue typically is recognized upon the later of customer acceptance or software shipment 
revenue from the sale of distribution rights is recognized upon the execution of a distribution agreement 
services revenue consists of consulting fees and support and maintenance fees 
consulting fees related to installation are recognized upon acceptance of the installation  and time and material billings are recognized based on a percentage of completion 
support and maintenance fees for our predecessor worldtalk products are paid for ongoing customer support as well as for the right to receive future upgrades of our products during the term of the maintenance agreement 
revenue from support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the period the support is provided 
transaction revenue is based on the volume of transactions by our customers  and the related revenue is recognized based on payment schedules and transaction reports from our customers 
a number of our contracts include minimum transaction volume requirements 
in these cases  the minimum guaranteed revenue is recognized when fees are due and payable during those months where transaction volume does not exceed the designated minimums 
transaction fees include routine maintenance and product updates 
product upgrades are available to existing customers for additional contractually specified fees 
a substantial portion of revenue relates to international customers or operations 
most of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  except in japan  where they are denominated in japanese yen 
however  in the future  an increasing number of contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies 
we currently do not have hedging or similar arrangements to protect us against foreign currency fluctuations 
therefore  we increasingly may be subject to currency fluctuations  which could harm our operating results in future periods 
our future net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by limitations on our ability to apply net operating losses for federal income tax reporting purposes against taxable income in future periods  including limitations due to ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  arising from issuance of stock 
on may   we repurchased from hikari tsushin of the outstanding stock of tumbleweed kk  or tkk  for a price of approximately  as a result of this transaction  we own a controlling interest of the japanese subsidiary and began accounting for the japanese subsidiary under the consolidation method effective april  on august   we repurchased an additional of the outstanding shares of the jointly owned japanese subsidiary  increasing our ownership position to 
on august   we completed a primary and secondary public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
of the  shares of common stock   primary shares were sold by us and  secondary shares were sold by our stockholders 
tumbleweed did not receive any of the proceeds from shares sold by its stockholders 
net proceeds of million from the offering of primary shares will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in addition  we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary products  technologies or businesses 
in january our board of directors approved a restructuring program 
this restructuring program focuses our efforts towards concentrating on our strongest opportunities  reducing operating expenses  and improving our allocation of resources 
the restructuring involved closing several international locations  realigning our professional services organization  and reducing headcount in most areas of our business 
the reduction in force involved approximately of our staff and total charges incurred as a result of the restructuring are anticipated to be approximately million in the first quarter of  which includes severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and charges related to vacating leased facilities domestically and abroad 
this estimate includes a million non cash accrual for potential losses on sub leased facilities primarily due to reduced sub lease rental income expectations reflecting rapidly declining office rent rates in and around silicon valley 
beginning in  we expect that new license agreements will generally incorporate upgrade fees as part of the license and transaction offering  and will recognize the combination of license  transaction and installation fees ratably over the term of the contract 
we expect that contract terms will be the shorter of the term of the contractually committed transaction bundles or the license term 
years ended december  and revenue

transaction fees revenue was million in compared to million in the increase in transaction fees revenue resulted from minimum transaction fees from customers due to the growth of our installed base  and to a lesser extent  due to the introduction of a transaction pricing model for the mms product line 
total revenue excluding discontinued product lines increased in there was no revenue from discontinued product lines in our sales were impacted by an unexpected slowdown in technology spending that arrived late in the year 
the slowdown affected us in some larger customer agreements we were in the midst of negotiating and subsequently  we were unable to complete sufficient sales in the fourth quarter of to meet our expectations 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue is comprised of license cost  services cost and transaction fees cost 
license cost is primarily comprised of royalties paid to third parties for software licensed by us for inclusion in our products 
services cost is comprised primarily of personnel and overhead costs related to customer support and contract development projects 
transaction fees cost is primarily comprised of royalties paid to third parties for software licensed by us for inclusion in our products and hardware and bandwidth costs associated with hosting ime servers for some customers 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in license cost increased to million in from  in license costs increased primarily due to increased sales of products containing software licensed from third parties 
the increase was not in direct proportion to the increase in license revenue as some of the agreements with third parties are on a fixed fee basis 
services cost increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs supporting an increase in new contract development projects and the acquisition of interface from september  transaction fees cost was  in compared to  in the increase in transaction fees cost resulted from allocated royalties due on transaction fees revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of engineering and related costs associated with the development of our applications  quality assurance and testing 
research and development costs increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased head count in part from our interface acquisition  increases in average salaries for development personnel  and increased facilities related expenses 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to increased personnel required to support new projects that will allow us to expand the functionality of the mms and ime product lines  further integrate ime and li into an integrated secure statement presentment platform and integrate all of our products with targeted third party software packages and services

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs for our finance  legal  information systems and human resources departments as well as professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was due in part to an increase in legal fees corresponding to patent infringement lawsuit we brought against the docspace company  inc  which is still pending  as well as increased staffing expenses and professional fees 
deferred compensation expense 
deferred compensation expense is recorded in connection with the grant of certain stock options to non employees and employees at exercise prices less than the deemed fair value on the grant date 
during the year ended december   we recorded aggregate deferred stock compensation expense of million compared to million for the year ended december  deferred stock compensation expense for includes million related to the interface acquisition and million resulting from the volatility of our stock price combined with certain stock option commitments made to employees which were not processed in a timely fashion 
the deferred stock compensation expense is being amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the options  which is generally four years 
amortization of stock compensation expense for was approximately million compared to million in merger related and restructuring expenses 
merger related and restructuring expenses  which were recorded in connection with the acquisition of worldtalk  are primarily comprised of investment banker s fees  legal fees  severance payments and accounting and printer fees 
merger related and restructuring expenses for fiscal were million 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million for fiscal the goodwill and other intangible assets resulted from the interface purchase and  to a lesser extent  our increase in ownership of tumbleweed kk from to during goodwill and other intangibles are amortized over their respective lives  generally one to three years 
other income  net 
other income  net  is primarily comprised of interest income earned on investment securities 
other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase in other income  net  is due to increased cash balances invested in money market accounts and commercial paper

cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in license cost decreased to  in from  in license costs decreased primarily due to reductions in certain royalty obligations and other amortized costs 
services cost increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs supporting an increase in new contract development projects and an increase in facilities related expenses 
transaction fees cost was  in compared to in the increase in transaction fees cost resulted from royalties due on transaction fees revenue and  to a lesser extent  depreciation expense and connectivity costs incurred in generating transaction fees revenue 
research and development expenses

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increased legal fees corresponding to the patent infringement lawsuit we brought against the docspace company  inc  which remains pending  as well as increased staffing expenses and professional fees 
other income  net 
other income  net  increased to million in from  in due to increased cash balances invested in money market accounts and commercial paper 
the increase in cash balances available for investment in resulted from proceeds from the issuance of equity securities  including common stock issued in our initial public offering completed in august liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used by operating activities for was million 
cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of a net operating loss and increased accounts receivable  offset by certain non cash charges and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities for was million 
net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of merger costs incurred as a part of the acquisitions of worldtalk and interface  the repurchase of additional shares of tumbleweed kk  capital expenditures related to increased facilities expansion  and certain investments 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million 
cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities to investors  including our public offering completed in august and sales of shares under stock option plans and warrants 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations related to outstanding operating and equipment leases 
we anticipate additional capital expenditures consistent with establishing infrastructure to support our growth 
in june  we entered into an operating lease covering approximately  square feet of office space in redwood city  california 
the lease is for a term of five years at monthly rent of approximately  in september  the company entered into an operating lease covering approximately  square feet of office space in an adjacent building in redwood city  california 
the lease term is for five years at monthly rent of approximately  we currently sublease this space 
this sublease is scheduled to expire with respect to half of the space in september and with respect to the other half in april we are currently searching for a new tenant to sublease this space 
if we are unable to find suitable sub tenants in a timely manner  we may experience greater than anticipated operating expenses in the future 
we have two equipment loan facilities totaling  with a bank 
the first equipment loan in the amount of  expires in december and the second equipment loan in the amount of million expires in december borrowings under both equipment loan facilities bear interest at the prime rate plus and are due and payable in equal monthly installments 
as of december   total borrowings under these equipment loan facilities were  in the aggregate and  remained available under the facilities 
in september  we entered into a  financing arrangement with another company to finance our directors and officers liability insurance premium 
borrowings under the loan agreement are payable in nine equal monthly installments 
as of december   there was no debt outstanding under this financing arrangement 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products and services  the resources we devote to development of our products and services and the resources we devote to sales and marketing 
we have experienced a substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses since our inception consistent with our relocation and the growth in operations and staffing 
we anticipate that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future  but not at the rate experienced during we also expect to make targeted additional investments in technologies  and plan to expand our sales force 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we will continue to consider our future financing alternatives  which may include the incurrence of indebtedness  additional public or private equity offerings or an equity investment by a strategic partner 
however  other than the equipment loan facilities  we have no present commitments or arrangements assuring us of any future equity or debt financing  and additional equity or debt financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
we expect to experience a seasonal reduction in sales in europe during the summer months 
in addition  many of our customers delay purchases of our products until the end of each quarter 
risks and uncertainties because we are in an early stage of development and have a history of losses  it is difficult to evaluate our business and we may face expenses  delays and difficulties 
we have only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation can be based 
accordingly  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in a similarly early stage of development  particularly companies engaged in new and rapidly evolving markets like secure online communication services 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had incurred cumulative net losses as a c corporation of million 
see consolidated statements of operations and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate continued losses 
our success will depend in large part upon our ability to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability and to effectively maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with customers and strategic partners 
if we do not succeed  our revenue may not increase  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability on a timely basis or at all 
in particular  we intend to expend significant financial and management resources on product development  sales and marketing  strategic relationships  technology and operating infrastructure 
as a result  we expect to incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
as a result of our transition from a traditional software licensing model to a subscription based pricing model  our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or expenses 
our success is dependent upon our ability to enter into and maintain strategic relationships with customers and to develop and maintain volume usage of our products by our customers and their end users 
our revenue has fluctuated and our quarterly operating results will continue to fluctuate based on the timing of the execution and termination of customer agreements in a given quarter 
under the licensing model  our license revenue was comprised of initial license and distribution fees 
as a result  we typically recognized initial license fees as revenue in the same quarter an agreement was signed 
under the subscription based pricing model  however  we will account for and report our contracted revenue over the life of the agreement 
in the first two quarters of  we will transition into the new subscription based pricing model 
during these quarters  we expect a significant decrease in recognized revenue as a result of our adoption of the new pricing model 
our services revenue historically has been comprised largely of implementation  customization and consulting fees 
our ability to receive revenue from services is subject to multiple risks  including the risk that we may not be able to meet increasing customer demand because of a lack of adequately trained personnel  and the risk that customers may not timely accept the services provided and delay payment for such services 
our transaction revenue historically has been comprised of contractual transaction minimums 
our ability to increase our transaction revenue through increased transaction volume depends on increased usage of our products by our customers and their end users 
unless and until we have developed a significant and recurring revenue stream our revenue will continue to fluctuate significantly 
in addition  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter for other reasons  including  but not limited to the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to our business  operations and infrastructure  including our international operations  our ability to accurately estimate and control costs  our ability to timely collect fees owed by customers  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products and services in the secure online communications or document delivery markets  and acquisitions that we complete or propose 
as a result of these factors  particularly our transition to a subscription based pricing model  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons may not be accurate indicators of future performance 
quarterly financials for under the new subscription based pricing model will not be comparable with historical quarters under the our previous licensing model 
because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  and because a high percentage of our costs are fixed  small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  many of our customers delay purchases of our products until the end of each quarter 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on our operating results 
moreover  we believe the difficulties outlined above with respect to financial forecasts also apply to securities analysts that may publish estimates of our financial results 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors due to any of a wide variety of factors  including fluctuations in financial ratios or other metrics used to measure our performance 
if this occurs  we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock 
our restructuring of operations may not achieve the results we intend and may harm our business 
in january  we announced a restructuring of our business  which included a reduction in force and the closure of three international locations  among other steps we took to reduce expenses 
the planning and implementation of our restructuring has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
additionally  the restructuring may negatively affect our employee turnover  recruiting and retention of important employees 
if we are unable to implement our restructuring effectively or if we experience difficulties in effecting the restructuring  our expenses could increase more quickly than we expect 
if we find that our restructuring announced in january is insufficient to decrease the growth of our expenses  we may find it necessary to implement further streamlining of our expenses  to perform another reduction in our headcount or to undertake a restructuring of our business 
a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our revenue and the failure to maintain or expand these relationships could harm our business 
the loss of one or more of our major customers  the failure to attract new customers on a timely basis  or a reduction in usage and revenue associated with the existing or proposed customers would harm our business and prospects 
five customers comprised approximately of our revenue in  and approximately of our revenue in we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our service provider customers may compete with us or fail to promote our product 
to date  we have generated a significant amount of tumbleweed ime revenue from contracts with a limited number of service provider customers  which use or intend to use our products for the communication of third party documents and data 
if these customers do not effectively promote the use of tumbleweed ime to their end users  the adoption of our services and the recognition of associated revenue could be limited 
because our contracts with our service provider customers are non exclusive  these customers could elect to offer competing secure online communication services to their customers through our existing or future competitors 
the service provider customers also may compete with our secure online communication services through their traditional physical delivery channels 
if we do not secure key relationships with enterprise customers  our access to broader markets will be limited 
our enterprise customers  which use or intend to use our products to intelligently manage the incoming and outgoing online communications of their enterprises  are a significant source of our revenue 
a key aspect of our strategy is to access target markets prior to adoption of alternative online distribution solutions by the larger participants in these markets 
the failure to secure key relationships with new enterprise customers in targeted markets could limit or effectively preclude our entry into these target markets  which would harm our business and prospects 
customers in a preliminary phase of implementing our product may not proceed on a timely basis or at all 
some of our customers are currently in a pre production or pre launch stage of implementing our products and may encounter delays or other problems in introducing them 
a customer s decision not to do so or a delay in implementation could result in a delay or loss in related revenue or otherwise harm our businesses and prospects 
we cannot predict when any customer that is currently in a pilot or preliminary phase will implement broader use of our services 
the markets for enhanced online communication services generally  and for our products specifically  are new and may not develop 
the market for our products and services is new and evolving rapidly 
if the market for our products and services fails to develop and grow  or if our products and services do not gain broad market acceptance  our business and prospects will be harmed 
in particular  our success will depend upon the adoption and use by current and potential customers and their end users of secure online communication services 
our success will also depend upon acceptance of our technology as the standard for providing these services 
the adoption and use of our products and services will involve changes in the manner in which businesses have traditionally exchanged information 
in addition  sales and marketing of our products and services is to a large extent under the control of our customers 
in some cases  our customers have little experience with products  services and technology like those offered by us 
our ability to influence usage of our products and services by customers and end users is limited 
for example  the usage of tumbleweed ime by the end users of our service provider customers has been limited to date 
we have spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers and their end users about the value of our products and services 
it is difficult to assess  or to predict with any assurance  the present and future size of the potential market for our products and services  or our growth rate  if any 
moreover  we cannot predict whether our products and services will achieve any market acceptance 
our ability to achieve our goals also depends upon rapid market acceptance of future enhancements of our products and our ability to identify new markets as they emerge 
any enhancement that is not favorably received by customers and end users may not be profitable and  furthermore  could damage our reputation or brand name 
any failure to identify and address new market opportunities could harm our business and prospects 
the markets we address are highly competitive and rapidly changing  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the multiple competitive pressures we face could harm our business and prospects 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
our principal competition in the areas of messaging management and secure communications are companies that offer of various internet content security  web security  messaging policy management  and enterprise relationship management products 
companies that sell products that compete with some of the features within our products include baltimore technologies plc  critical path  inc  kana communications  inc  symantec corp  tivoli systems  inc  an ibm company  trend micro incorporated  valicert inc  and zixit corporation 
our principal competition in the statement presentment market area comes from other online communication or information security service providers  some of which have services or products that are intended to compete directly with our products or that could be used as alternatives to our products 
examples of some of these providers are automatic data processing  inc  critical path  inc  new river systems  postx corporation and vestcom corporation 
our solution statement presentment and secure delivery solutions can be an alternative to traditional mail and courier delivery services such as those offered by federal express corporation  ups  or the us postal service  and to general purpose e mail applications and services 
in addition  companies with which we do not presently directly compete may become competitors in the future  either through the expansion of our products or through their product development in the area of secure online communication services 
these companies include international business machines corporation lotus development corporation  microsoft corporation and verisign  inc the principal competitive factors in our industry include price  product functionality  product integration  platform coverage and ability to scale  worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base 
additionally  some of these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with product lines we market and distribute 
we expect that the market for mission critical messaging software  which has been fragmented historically  will become more consolidated with larger companies being better positioned to compete in such an environment in the long term 
as this market continues to develop  a number of companies with greater resources than ours could attempt to increase their presence in this market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors or business partners 
our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competing forces  to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors  and to educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing our products rather than developing their own products 
competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products in order to compete with us 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry for the software market  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
we face technical  operational and strategic challenges that may prevent us from successfully integrating companies we may acquire 
the integration of the worldtalk communications corporation business and the interface systems  inc business  including the technology  operations and personnel of each of them  has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
additionally  the integration of any other company or business we may acquire in the future will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
whenever an acquisition is completed  we must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating the operations of any company we acquire  including potential inability to fully integrate products  potential incompatibility of business cultures  perceived adverse changes in business focus  potential conflicts in customer  advertising or strategic relationships  potential failure to complete anticipated sales  and the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns 
as a result  we may not be successful in integrating any business or technologies we acquire and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
we also cannot guarantee that acquisitions will result in sufficient revenues or earnings to justify our investment in  or expenses related to  such acquisitions 
nor can we guarantee that any anticipated synergies will develop 
if we fail to execute our acquisition strategy successfully for any reason  our business will suffer significantly 
our product development efforts may be hindered by a variety of factors 
our new product releases may not be timely  scalable  or successful enough to meet customers requirements 
in addition  we also face certain risks associated with the ongoing integration of the worldtalk technology and interface technology 
for example  because worldtalk has historically based its products on an nt platform and we have created a platform independent architecture for the tumbleweed ime products  the integration of products from worldtalk may result in unanticipated architectural incompatibilities that would require additional time and engineering resources to resolve 
the loss of key engineering personnel from worldtalk  interface or any other entities we may acquire may increase the time and resources needed to resolve these and other technical integration issues 
our headquarters and the offices of the companies we have acquired are in different locations  which may create coordination issues and could increase employee turnover 
in addition  the installation of integrated or complementary software products at customer sites may result in difficulties associated with customer specific installation processes 
the expansion of our business has placed a strain on resources 
our business has expanded considerably during for example  the number of our employees increased from as of december  to as of december  this expansion has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on managerial  informational  administrative and operational resources 
our current systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to achieve the rapid execution necessary to effectively operate within the market for our products and services 
we need to enhance and improve our managerial capacity  and improve or replace our existing operational  customer service and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any failure to properly manage these systems and procedural transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers  and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and delays in the execution of our business plan 
we will also need to continue the expansion of our operations and employee base 
our management may not be able to hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
in addition  our management may not be able to successfully identify  manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
if we cannot manage growth effectively  our business and operating results could suffer 
we have a lengthy sales and implementation cycle which could harm our business 
if we are unable to license our services to new customers on a timely basis or if our existing and proposed customers and their end users suffer delays in the implementation and adoption of our services  our revenue may be limited and business and prospects may be harmed 
our customers must evaluate our technology and integrate our products and services into the products and services they provide 
in addition  our customers may need to adopt a comprehensive sales  marketing and training program in order to effectively implement tumbleweed ime 
finally  we must coordinate with our customers using our product for third party communications in order to assist end users in the adoption of our products 
for these and other reasons  the cycle associated with establishing licenses and implementing our products can be lengthy 
this cycle is also subject to a number of significant delays over which we have little or no control 
forecasts about license revenue may be inaccurate as a result of any or all of these factors  and inaccurate forecasts may cause our business  or market valuation  to suffer 
a failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm the business 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and licenses  together with non disclosure and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products 
we hold certain patent rights with respect to some of our products and currently have a lawsuit pending against the docspace company  inc alleging infringement of one of our patents by docspace 
we have filed  and expect in the future to file  additional patent applications 
our existing patents or trademarks  as well as any future patents or trademarks obtained by us  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
further patent or trademark protection may not be obtained  in the united states or elsewhere  for our existing or new products  applications or services 
in addition  further protection  if obtained  may not be effective 
in some countries  meaningful patent or trademark protection is not available 
to date  we have not received any claims of infringement upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future  and the cost of responding to such assertions  regardless of their validity  could be significant 
in addition  such claims may be found to be valid and could result in awards against us  which could harm our business 
we also rely  to some extent  on unpatented trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information 
our policy is to have employees sign confidentiality agreements  to have selected parties sign non competition agreements and to have third parties sign non disclosure agreements 
although we take precautionary measures to maintain our unpatented proprietary information  others may acquire equivalent information or otherwise gain access to or disclose our proprietary information and we may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights to our proprietary information 
profitable expansion in international markets may be difficult 
we invested significant financial and managerial resources to expand our sales and marketing operations in international markets and have opened sales offices in germany  the united kingdom  japan and the netherlands 
in fiscal and in fiscal  we derived and  respectively  of our revenue from international operations 
however  to date  we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
a key component of our long term strategy is to further expand into international markets  and we must continue to devote substantial resources to our international operations in order to succeed in these markets 
in this regard  we may encounter difficulties such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and trade barriers applicable to the internet or our business  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations  including employment laws and practices as we expand into continental europe  seasonal reductions in business activity and economic downturns  in particular  in europe and asia  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  problems associated with the conversion of various european currencies into a single currency  the euro  legal challenges or regulatory requirements related to the export or import of encryption technologies  differing technology standards  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries in which we operate or plan to operate 
in addition  our expansion into international markets will increasingly subject us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  an increasing number of our contracts may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
we do not presently engage in hedging or similar transactions to protect us from currency fluctuations 
any of the foregoing difficulties of conducting business internationally could harm our international operations and  consequently  our business and prospects 
if we do not provide adequate support services to our customers to implement our products  our business may suffer 
our professional services organization assists our customers in implementing our products through software installation  integration with existing customer systems  contract engineering  consulting and training 
if the professional services organization does not adequately assess customer requirements or address technical problems  customers may seek to discontinue their relationships with us due to dissatisfaction with the product or our customer support 
furthermore  these customers may realize lower usage than they could have otherwise achieved because they did not fully capitalize on the product in ways that could have been addressed by our professional services organization 
our products must be integrated with existing hardware and complex software products of our customers or other third parties  and our customers may not have significant experience with the implementation of products similar to our own 
in addition  the provision of contract engineering and integration services is an increasingly important aspect of our strategy to strengthen customer loyalty to our product and company 
therefore  our business and future prospects significantly depend on the strength of our professional services organization and our ability to leverage this organization by augmenting our reach through trained and qualified systems integrators 
product performance problems  system failures  and internet problems could severely damage our business 
the ability of our customers to use tumbleweed based services depends on stable product performance  and the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the computer and communications hardware as well as the software and internet network systems that they maintain 
although our ability to manage the effects of system failures which occur in computer hardware  software and network systems is limited  the occurrences of these failures could harm our reputation  business and prospects 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of our infrastructure  and the internet could face similar outages and delays in the future 
in addition  an increasing number of our customers require us to provide computer and communications hardware  software and internet networking systems to them as an outsourced data center service 
all data centers  whether hosted by us  our customers or by an independent third party to which it outsources this function  are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure or other similar events 
if our software contains errors  we may lose customers or experience reduced market acceptance of our products 
our software products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only when the products are in use 
in addition  some of our customers require or may require enhanced customization of our software for their specific needs  and these modifications may increase the likelihood of undetected defects or errors 
further  we often render implementation  consulting and other technical services  the performance of which typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and networking systems  and we could fail to meet customer expectations as a result of any defects or errors 
as a result  we may lose customers  customers may fail to implement our products more broadly within their organization and we may experience reduced market acceptance of our products 
some of our products are designed to facilitate the secure transmission of sensitive business information to specified parties outside the business over the internet 
as a result  the reputation of our software products for providing good security is vital to their acceptance by customers 
our products may be vulnerable to break ins  theft or other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information for which we are responsible 
problems caused by product defects  failure to meet project milestones for services or security breaches could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of research and development resources  harm to our reputation  or increased insurance  service and warranty costs 
to address these problems  we may need to expend significant capital resources that may not have been budgeted 
we may be unable to recruit  retain and motivate qualified personnel  which could harm our business  including product development 
we must continue to identify  recruit  hire  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  marketing and customer service personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may not be able to successfully recruit  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in particular  we may encounter difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified software developers and sales personnel  and we may not be able to retain these employees 
the failure to recruit and retain necessary technical  managerial  sales  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel could harm our business and our ability to obtain new customers and develop new products 
although we have used and continue to use stock options as a retention tool  many of our employees hold stock options that are underwater ie  the market price of our stock is below their option exercise price and these options may be ineffective as a retention tool 
our employee turnover may increase if outstanding stock options continue to remain underwater and we do not adjust the option exercise prices 
any adjustment of stock option exercise prices may result in dilution to our stockholders and depress our stock price 
if we lose the services of executive officers or other key employees  our ability to develop our business and secure customer relationships will suffer 
we are substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could significantly harm our business and prospects 
our efforts to establish  maintain and strengthen our brands will require significant expenditures and may not be successful 
if the marketplace does not associate our brands with high quality internet communication services  it may be more difficult for us to attract new customers or introduce future products and services 
the market for our services is new 
therefore  our failure to establish brand recognition at this stage could harm our ability to compete in the future with other companies that successfully establish a brand name for their services 
we must succeed in our marketing efforts  provide high quality services and increase our user base in order to build our brand awareness and differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
these efforts have required significant expenditures to date 
moreover  we believe that these efforts will require substantial commitments of resources in the future as our brands become increasingly important to our overall strategy and as the market for our services grows 
because our products utilize the internet  if use of the internet does not increase  the level of use of our products will suffer 
if the internet and other products and services necessary for the utilization of our products are not sufficiently developed  fewer customers and end users will use our products and our business will be harmed 
in particular  the success of our products and services will depend on the development and maintenance of adequate internet infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and other features demanded by users 
moreover  our success will also depend on the timely development of complementary products or services such as high speed internet connections for providing reliable access and services and this may not occur 
because the online exchange of information is new and evolving  the internet may not prove to be a viable platform for secure online communication services in the long term 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users and frequency of use  or if its users require increasingly more resources  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it 
as a result  the performance or reliability of the internet may be harmed 
this in turn could decrease the level of internet usage and also the level of utilization of our products and services 
government regulation relating to the internet may increase costs of doing business or require changes in our business model 
we are subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to companies utilizing the internet 
although there are currently few laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet 
these laws could cover issues like user privacy  pricing  content  intellectual property  distribution  taxation  antitrust  legal liability and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations could decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business or otherwise harm our business or prospects 
delays in the enactment of expected regulations may result in delayed software purchasing by our customers who are subject to such regulations  which in turn may harm our business 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues like property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
for example  tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce 
new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes 
any new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could harm our ability to conduct business and harm operating results 
our products are subject to export controls  and we may be unable to obtain necessary export approvals 
exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the us and various foreign governments 
all cryptographic products require export licenses from certain us government agencies 
we have obtained approval to export products using up to bit symmetric encryption and bit public key encryption  including ime server  ime desktop  ime receive applet  ime remote api using omniorb with ssl  mms worldwide and mms strong worldwide we are not exporting other products and services that are subject to export control under us law 
however  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the related regulatory policies  could be revised  and we may not be able to obtain necessary approval for the export of future products 
the inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could limit our ability to make international sales 
furthermore  competitors may also seek to obtain approvals to export products that could increase the amount of competition we face 
additionally  countries outside of the us could impose regulatory restrictions impairing our ability to import our products into those countries 
costs of communicating via the internet could increase if access fees are imposed 
certain local telephone carriers have asserted that the increasing popularity and use of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure  and that many areas with high internet use have begun to experience interruptions in telephone service 
these carriers have petitioned the federal communications commission to impose access fees on internet service providers and online service providers 
if these access fees are imposed  the costs of communicating on the internet could increase substantially  potentially slowing the increasing use of the internet 
this could in turn decrease demand for our services or increase the costs of doing business 
we may have liability for internet content 
as a provider of internet communication products and services  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted online 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage  could be costly and could require us to implement measures to reduce exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue selected service or product offerings 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by users of our product but may be exposed to liability with respect to this content 
furthermore  certain foreign governments  such as germany  have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the us other countries  such as china  regulate or prohibit the transport of telephonic data in their territories 
failure to comply with regulations in a particular jurisdiction could result in fines or criminal penalties or the termination of service in one or more jurisdictions 
moreover  the increased attention focused on liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of internet use 
liability insurance may not cover claims of these types  or may not be adequate to indemnify against all liability that may be imposed 
interface systems  inc  a tumbleweed subsidiary  is a defendant in several purported securities class action lawsuits 
on july   three complaints were filed by david h 
zimmer  congressional securities  inc and other plaintiffs against interface and various additional defendants  including interface s president and chief executive officer  robert a 
nero and fiserv correspondent services  inc  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the three cases contain substantially similar allegations of false and misleading representations by various defendants allegedly designed to inflate interface s stock price 
the complaints seek relief under the federal securities laws on behalf of purported classes of persons who purchased  held  or sold shares of interface stock  and under various other causes of action 
on september   we filed i a motion to strike or dismiss for failure to meet the certification requirements of the private securities litigation reform act  ii a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim  and iii a motion to dismiss because of improper venue  or in the alternative  motion to transfer the lawsuits to the eastern district of michigan 
these motions remain pending 
although we believe these lawsuits are without merit  no assurance can be given about their outcome  and an adverse outcome could significantly harm our business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending these complaints could harm future operating results 
we may be unable to find sub tenants to sublease currently leased space 
in september  we entered into a lease covering  square feet of office space adjacent to our headquarters 
this lease is for five years at a monthly rent of approximately  although we currently sublease this space  this sublease is scheduled to expire with respect to half of the space in september and with respect to the other half in april we are currently searching for a new tenant to sublease this space 
we also sublease an additional  square feet in santa clara  california and  in new york city to third parties 
we may not be able to find suitable sub tenants to occupy these spaces in the future in a timely manner  if at all  or otherwise sublease these properties profitably 
if we are unable to find suitable sub tenants  we may experience greater than anticipated operating expenses in the future 
internet related stock prices are especially volatile and this volatility may depress our stock price 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities of technology companies  particularly internet related companies  have been highly volatile 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
the institution of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could harm our business and prospects 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage or prevent an acquisition of tumbleweed  which could depress our stock price 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes of control that are not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in particular  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and prohibits stockholder action by written consent 
these provisions require advance notice for nomination of directors and stockholders proposals 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  this law prevents a person who becomes the owner of or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock from engaging in specified business combinations for three years unless specified conditions are satisfied 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
this could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
the issuance of preferred stock also could effectively limit the voting power of the holders of tumbleweed common stock 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  may discourage or prevent an acquisition or disposition of our business 
future sales of common stock by our stockholders could depress our stock price 
we cannot predict if future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our common stock for sale  will depress the market price for our common stock or our ability to raise capital by offering equity securities 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that these sales could occur  may depress prevailing market prices for the common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses in europe and japan which are denominated in local currencies 
however  as of december   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in europe or japan which are denominated in local currencies 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program 
interest rate sensitivity the primary object of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we received from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed rate equal to the then prevailing interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because these funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in one year over one or less year total fair value included in cash and cash equivalents  none   weighted average interest rate
