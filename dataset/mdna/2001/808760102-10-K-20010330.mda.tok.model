in  sales to public schools represented approximately of total revenues compared to in we commenced operations in february  and  until april  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing the fast forword language program  performing a field trial  recruiting and training personnel  establishing relationships with  and training educators and speech and language professionals  and raising capital 
since the commercial launch of fast forword language in april  we have also devoted substantial efforts to sales and marketing activities 
we have an accumulated deficit of million from inception through december  our goal is to report an operating profit in the fourth quarter of we expect to incur additional losses until that time  due primarily to substantial increases in sales and marketing  increased personnel related costs and expenditures for travel  advertising  promotion  new product launches and other activities 
these losses may be substantial 
in addition  we may be unable to meet our targets for the fourth quarter of with respect to revenues or operating results and incur substantial additional losses 
if we do not meet our targets  we may be forced to reduce our expenses which may negatively impact our business 
revenues we derive revenues from the sales of licenses for our software and service fees 
the total value of software and services invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenues until recognized 
program and product revenues are derived from the sale of the company s software for limited term site licenses  individual participant licenses  and perpetual licenses 
customers license the right to use fast forword family of products and do not acquire or otherwise gain unlimited rights to use the programs 
revenues from the sales of software products with perpetual licenses are recognized when the products are shipped  collectibility is probable and the fees are fixed or determinable 
revenue from the sale of site licenses is recognized over the life of the license  typically to months 
revenue from individual participant licenses is recognized over the average period of use  typically weeks 
service revenues are derived from the company s conferences and training seminars for learning facilitators and from services provided to customers 
revenues from conferences seminars are recognized when the they are held 
revenues from support services are recognized over the period of the licenses 
our revenues have been derived almost exclusively from the sale of our fast forword family of programs and related seminars and services 
while we are developing additional products based upon our proprietary technology and neuroscience expertise  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
in addition  to date  the substantial majority of our sales of our training programs have been through public schools and speech and language professionals 
due to the inherent complexity of selling to schools and school districts  our sales cycle has lengthened as we have increasingly focused on this market 
this trend may continue as a higher proportion of our business comes from the public school market 
as a result  we may have limited visibility on our future revenues  and such revenues may fluctuate substantially 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of program and service costs 
program costs consist of costs associated with program sales  including royalties  manufacturing  packaging  documentation  fulfillment  amortization of capitalized software costs  internet hosting for the upload of performance data  and technical support costs 
service costs consist primarily of the costs of providing training seminars and installations and services to consumers who buy directly from us  including personnel  materials  facilities and travel 
these costs of revenues are generally recognized as incurred 
we generally recognize significantly higher gross margins on our program revenues than on our service revenues 
operating expense our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  advertising and promotional materials  public relations costs and travel 
research and development expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research and product development activities  product testing  and software and equipment costs 
we expense all software development costs associated with a product until technological feasibility is established  after which time all these associated costs are capitalized until the product is available for commercial release and are amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
technological feasibility is deemed established upon completion of a working version 
general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to company executives and other employees and consultants in accouning and administration 
these expenses also include travel expenses for these employees as well as outside legal and accounting fees 
we recorded no deferred compensation during the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to employees 
these amounts are being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting periods of the individual stock options 
this amortization amounted to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the remaining aggregate deferred compensation of  will be amortized over the remainder of the vesting periods of the options generally five years

sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel  marketing and travel costs 
at year end  we had quota bearing sales personnel selling to public schools 
we expect further increases in sales and marketing expenses in the future as we increase marketing efforts for current and future products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in the current year compared to we expect research and development expense to decline in because we have decreased our research efforts outside our core language and reading area 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel  consulting  legal and travel costs 
provision for income taxes we have recorded no provision for income taxes as we have incurred losses since inception 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in years through utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of previous or contemplated equity transactions may result in such an ownership change 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before becoming available to reduce future tax liabilities 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance

cost of services revenues increased to from in the current period compared to due to administrator training and installation of our training programs in public schools 
to encourage schools to adopt our training programs  we have offered discounts on administrator training and installation services 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel  marketing and travel costs 
we increased our quota bearing sales force from to during the year 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to as we increased the number of employees and consultants to develop new products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel  consulting  legal and travel costs 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in operating activities during this period was primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with growing our sales and marketing groups and funding increased research and development 
we expect that the cash required to fund operations will decline in based on our targeted increase in sales 
if we are unable to meet our sales and revenue targets  or our expenses are higher than our current plans  our cash consumption could be higher than that of net cash provided by investing activities was million in the year ended december  primarily from the sale of government securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively primarily for purchases of property and equipment and short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities in and were from our initial public offering in and the proceeds of the sale of convertible preferred stock in and as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and government securities of million 
in march  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with fleet national bank 
the facility was guaranteed by an affiliate of warburg  pincus ventures  llp  our largest shareholder 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and investments in government securities combined with the proceeds of loans under the fleet national bank facility will be sufficient to finance our presently anticipated operating losses and planned capital expenditure requirements 
however  our business may fail to meet our cash flow projections and  if so  we cannot be certain that our cash resources will be sufficient 
we therefore may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future 
we may not be able to obtain the additional financing to satisfy our cash requirements on acceptable terms or at all 
to date the company has paid no dividends 
we have no plans to initiate dividends in the next months 
we currently have no significant long term obligations  which extend beyond months except in connection with the lease of our corporate office facilities 
the minimum lease payments on our new facility is approximately  per month in the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of 
the lease terminates in march minimum lease payments on our former office facility are approximately   per month through august see note of notes to financial statements 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the rate of interest we will pay on our revolving credit facility with fleet national bank fleet 
interest rates on loans extended under that facility are at libor london interbank offered rate plus one percent  or at fleet s base rate at the company s choice 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not have a material affect on our expenses or loss 
we also have some market risk related to interest rate changes due to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not cause the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents to change by a material amount 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income
