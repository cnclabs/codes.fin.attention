item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in this annual report 
in particular  for information regarding the company s operations in different industry segments and geographic locations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general jlm is a leading marketer and distributor of certain commodity chemicals  principally acetone and phenol 
the company believes it is the second largest marketer of acetone and the fifth largest marketer of phenol in north america 
jlm is also a global distributor of olefins  principally propylene  as well as a variety of other commodity and specialty chemicals 
in order to provide stable and reliable sources of supply for its products  the company i maintains established supplier relationships with several major chemical companies  ii manufactures phenol and acetone and iii sources acetone from its joint venture manufacturing operation 
the company s business consists of manufacturing and marketing segments 
the company s manufacturing segment includes the operations of the blue island plant and the sale of acetone manufactured at the mt 
vernon phenol plant 
the company s marketing segment includes its distribution  storage and terminaling operations and all other sourcing operations 
a majority of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of commodity chemicals  prices for which are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
the company endeavors to enter into supply contracts that provide a fixed percentage profit per unit of product sold 
during the second half of through the first quarter  the company s performance was negatively impacted by the petrochemical down cycle in which both overall pricing and margins accelerated downward 
pricing pressure on manufactured products  specifically phenol  continued during the period coupled with substantial increases in raw material feedstock costs 
beginning in the second quarter  major us phenol acetone producers  including the company  announced price increases which became effective april  in addition  raw materials costs began dropping in the second half of raw material pricing has continued to decline in the first quarter of  leading to some recovery of the company s operating margins 
set forth below  for the periods indicated  is certain information regarding the contributions by the marketing and manufacturing segments to the company s revenues  gross profit  operating income  gross margin and operating margin 
the marketing segment revenues include an assumed selling commission determined in accordance with industry standards for the sale of products that are manufactured at the blue island plant 
in addition  the marketing segment operating income reflects the expenses associated with the sale of such products 
the marketing segment also includes an assumed allocation of revenues  costs of goods sold and expenses associated with the sale of products sourced from the mt 
vernon plant  which allocation has been determined on a basis consistent with the assumed commission for sale of products manufactured at the blue island plant 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
as a percentage of segment revenues years ended december  gross profit marketing manufacturing total gross profit segment operating income loss marketing manufacturing total segment operating income loss year ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenues marketing    manufacturing    total revenues    gross profit marketing    manufacturing    total gross profit    segment operating income loss marketing    manufacturing    total segment operating income loss  corporate expense    total operating income loss    marketing segment the marketing segment revenues are influenced largely by the volume of new and existing products sold by the company 
the volume of products sold depends on a number of factors  including strength in the homebuilding and automobile industries and the overall economic environment 
the company s supply agreements  primarily relating to acetone  frequently contain a term providing for a fixed percentage profit per unit of product sold 
in addition  the company s supplier and customer contracts have a provision permitting the company to purchase or sell additional product at the company s option  typically plus or minus of the contractual volume amount 
as a result  during a period of pricing volatility  the company has the opportunity to improve its profitability by exercising the appropriate option to either build inventory in a rising price environment or to sell product for future delivery in a declining price environment 
in may  the company and its joint venture partners agreed to restructure their investments in otc 
as a result  the company and uds bought out the interest of a third joint venture partner and each became a owner of otc 
the company accounts for its investment in otc through the equity method of accounting 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as part of the restructuring  otc s million of existing indebtedness was refinanced and the take or pay terminaling agreement between otc and the company s olefins marketing operations was cancelled and a new terminaling arrangement was implemented 
under the new arrangement  effective as of january   the company pays terminal throughput fees only when it utilizes the terminaling facility thus generating offsetting revenues 
this restructuring has improved the company s gross profit potential as compared to historical results because the company is no longer required to incur terminal fees without accompanying revenues 
manufacturing segment the results of operations of the company s manufacturing segment are influenced by a number of factors  including economic conditions  competition and the cost of raw materials  principally propylene and benzene 
the company s ability to pass along raw material price increases to its customers is limited because the commodity nature of the chemicals manufactured at the blue island plant restricts the company s ability to increase prices 
the development of financial instruments to hedge against changes in the prices of propylene and benzene has occurred in the past few years 
the company may seek periodically in the future  to the extent available  to enter into financial hedging contracts for the purchase of propylene and benzene in an effort to manage its raw material purchase costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that the company will utilize such financial hedging contracts or that the use of such instruments by the company will be successful 
the company can be exposed to losses in connection with such contracts equal to the amount by which the fixed hedge price on the contract is above the market price for such chemicals at the time of purchase 
the company did not enter into any material financial hedging contracts in since its acquisition in  the blue island plant has operated at or near full capacity and  in order to economically expand its production capacity  the company would be required to incur significant costs  as a result  the company has no plans to expand the capacity of the blue island plant 
the company has successfully marketed all the acetone offered under this agreement and believes that it will be able to do so in the future 
since  the company has sourced on average approximately million pounds of acetone annually from the mt 
vernon plant 
in  the amount of acetone available to jlm from the mt 
vernon plant was reduced by approximately million pounds 
over the next four years  the amount of acetone available to jlm was further reduced by approximately to million pounds as a result of increased consumption by ge plastics 
through improvement in operating efficiency the mt 
vernon plant has increased their acetone output  thereby offsetting increased internal consumption 
as a result  jlm does not anticipate any further material reduction in volume 
tax matters jlm accounts for us income taxes and accrues for us income tax liabilities based on its consolidated us earnings 
the company s foreign subsidiaries file tax returns in the countries where incorporated 
to the extent these subsidiaries are profitable  taxes are paid based on each country s prevailing tax rate 
upon repatriation of non us earnings  the non us allows a foreign tax credit  subject to certain limitations  to be applied against the company s us consolidated return for the foreign taxes paid by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
if losses are incurred  countries in which the company s foreign subsidiaries are incorporated generally allow the losses to be carried forward and applied against income earned in subsequent years 
the company s former venezuelan operation incurred losses which generated net operating loss carryforwards nols and  based on venezuelan tax regulations  these nols may be carried forward for three years 
the company purchased approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in holland  through the acquisition of tolson  that can be carried forward indefinitely 
during and  respectively  the holland operation generated approximately  and million  respectively  of income on which there will be no income taxes payable either currently or in the future due to the purchased nol carryforwards 
however  the utilization of the acquired tax credits results in deferred tax expense being recognized of approximately  in and  in in general  foreign losses are not deductible for us federal income tax purposes and as a result cannot be offset against us pre tax profits 
in an effort to reduce its us federal and state income tax liability  in the company established a foreign sales corporation fsc 
under the internal revenue code  fscs are granted tax incentives for exporting us produced goods overseas  and as such  there are specific tax benefits to the company for the products it exports 
if specific conditions are met under the internal revenue code  up to of the commission income earned by the fsc from these export transactions may be exempted from us taxation 
since the formation of the fsc and prior to  the company had met these requirements  thereby reducing its taxable income 
due to losses incurred by the qualified exporting entities during the tax year  the company derived no benefit from the fsc

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s us transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the company s foreign subsidiaries operate in their local currencies 
the company does  from time to time  purchase short term forward hedge exchange contracts to hedge payments that are in other than the local currency

jlm records these exchanges of inventory at the lower of cost or market 
as of december   the company had the following related to inventory exchanges total pounds receivable under the exchange contracts  total amount receivable under the exchange contracts  weighted average price per pound receivable under the exchange contracts due to the fact that the company is a market maker in acetone  the company normally becomes aware of future price fluctuations in acetone prior to such prices being disclosed on the open market 
therefore  the company believes that it can reposition itself with respect to the inventory exchanges in order to minimize the market risk inherent in such positions

the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates see notes and to the consolidated financial statements
