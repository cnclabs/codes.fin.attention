item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  the description of the partnership s business operations  and the financial statements and related notes and schedules included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see item business forward looking statements 
the only tenant of the partnership s properties is ffp marketing  and individuals employed by ffp marketing also manage the business and affairs of the partnership 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the annual report on form k of ffp marketing for its fiscal year ended december  the failure for any reason by ffp marketing to pay rent to the partnership is a material risk factor regarding an investment in the limited partner units 
as previously discussed  the partnership and its assets and businesses were restructured at the close of its fiscal year  as follows the partnership retained all of the real property used in its former retail operations and entered into long term  triple net leases of that real property with ffp marketing  and all of its other assets and businesses were transferred to ffp marketing 
in addition to retaining the real estate referred to above  the partnership retained certain liabilities  principally bank debt and other debt secured by the real estate retained by it 
all other liabilities including trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  money orders payable  deferred income taxes  and obligations under capital leases were transferred to ffp marketing 
accordingly  the partnership s business since the december restructuring consists of the leasing and management of its current real estate holdings and the possible acquisition  leasing and management of additional real properties 
all operations  assets  and businesses of the partnership prior to are not comparable to the operations  assets  and businesses of the partnership after the december restructuring 
operations compared to operations the partnership earned  in  a  improvement over net income of  in the major reasons for this increase were additional interest income of  from investments in marketable securities  reduced by unrealized and realized losses of  on marketable securities  and net gains of  on the sale of properties 
the company earned comprehensive net income in of  comprised of its net income of  minus a net loss arising from a net unrealized loss on available for sale securities of  in  the company s net income equaled its comprehensive net income because it did not own any available for sale securities in total revenues in were  a increase over total revenues of  total revenues increased in primarily because the properties purchased in february by the partnership were leased to ffp marketing for months in instead of only months as in interest and other income increased to  in  a improvement over interest income of  in the prior year 
principal components of this increase were interest income for an additional two months under the direct financing leases in than in  interest income on bond investments and bond discount income 
the following table reflects the components of interest and other income in and in thousands interest income from direct financing leases interest income from affiliate interest income from bond investments bond discount income interest income on notes receivable unrealized and realized losses on trading securities total interest income interest expense in was  an increase over interest expense in of  this increase resulted primarily from payments for months in  instead of only months as in  on the debt incurred in purchasing the properties in february  and a higher percentage of interest expense and a higher interest rate on a long term loan obtained in october to refinance a prior loan 
in addition  the partnership increased its equity in real estate properties by making principal payments on its long term debts in the amounts of  in and  in depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively flat at  in  compared to  in general and administrative expenses were  in  representing a increase from general and administrative expenses in of  in each year  these amounts include the overhead reimbursement fee of  paid to ffp marketing  as well as auditing fees  tax return software processing fees  tax return preparation fees  and miscellaneous expenses in maintaining properties not under lease 
cash flows provided by operating activities were  in  compared to  in the principal reason for this decrease was the purchase of trading securities  which was offset in part by an improvement in cash flow from rental properties 
cash flows provided by investing activities were  in  compared to cash flows used in investing activities of  in the principal source of these funds in was proceeds from the sale of real property  and the principal investing activity for these funds was interest bearing advances to ffp marketing 
cash flows used in financing activities were  in  compared to cash flows provided from financing activities of  in cash flows from financing activities in were used principally in repaying long term debt  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities in incurred in connection with debt incurred to purchase properties in february operations compared to operations the partnership earned  in  a considerable improvement compared to a net loss of  in total revenues in were  a  increase  or  over total revenues of  total revenues increased in because of the properties purchased in february by the partnership and immediately leased to ffp marketing 
interest expense in was  a increase over interest expense in of  this increase resulted primarily from the additional debt incurred in purchasing the properties in february  and a higher percentage of interest expense and a higher interest rate in a new long term loan obtained in october to refinance a prior loan 
in addition  the partnership increased its equity in real estate properties by making principal payments on its long term debts in the amounts of  in and  in depreciation and amortization expense was  in  compared to  in this increase resulted from additional amortization expense related to loan fees incurred in general and administrative expenses were  in  representing a decrease from general and administrative expenses in of  in each year  these amounts include the overhead reimbursement fee of  paid to ffp marketing  as well as auditing fees  tax return software processing fees  tax return review fees  and miscellaneous expenses in maintaining unleased properties 
cash flows provided by operating activities were  in  compared to  in  a decrease 
cash flows from financing activities were  in  compared to a usage of  in  resulting from acquisition debt in purchasing the properties in february cash flows used in investing activities were  in  compared to a usage of  in comparison to reit s the partnership is not a real estate investment trust reit  but its activities are much like those of a reit 
one performance measure used within the reit industry is funds from operations ffo 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  means net income loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  but excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings  similar activities  and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and with adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo was developed by nareit as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
while ffo is one appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit  it i does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of net income  ii is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs  and iii should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the partnership s operating performance  or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of either liquidity or the partnership s ability to make distributions or to fund its other operations 
the following table presents the determination of ffo for the partnership for the last three years in thousands  except per units data net income loss before minority interests gains from sales of properties losses on marketable securities depreciation and amortization    funds from operations before minority interests   less of ffo attributable to minority interests in subsidiary funds from operations ffo for the partnership ffo per unit based on units outstanding for diluted net income loss per unit calculations although the partnership has generated positive ffo  it has not made distributions to holders of the limited partnership units because substantially all cash generated from the partnership s operations has been required for debt payments 
thus far  the trust managers have determined to utilize such funds to build equity in its properties 
the refinancing of partnership long term debt in october provide that the partnership shall limit distributions to its partners such that  after making any distribution  a the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the pledged properties secured by that loan summarized below shall not be less than to  and b the fixed charge coverage ratio for the partnership summarized below shall be less than to 
in general  the fixed charge coverage ratio during any period for a pledged store equals the cash flow pre tax income before minority interest  plus depreciation and interest expense of that store for that period  divided by the amount of debt payments for that store for that period  and the fixed charge coverage ratio during a period equals the cash flow pre tax income before minority interest  plus depreciation and interest expense of the partnership for that period  divided by the amount of debt payments of the partnership for that period 
each fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated for the month period ending each december management has not yet determined if or how much of any partnership distributions will be made to the holders of the limited partnership units 
inflation the partnership s real property leases with ffp marketing provide that the partnership s rent income will increase every five years  assuming that those leases are renewed at that time  as a result of increases in the consumer price index during the prior five year period 
the partnership s long term debt is subject to interest expense that accrues at a fixed rate 
otherwise  the partnership believes inflation will not have a material effect on operating results 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership has contracted with ffp marketing to provide all cash management services on behalf of the partnership 
for that reason  the partnership does not maintain a bank account 
all of the partnership s cash receipts are received  and all of its disbursements are made  by ffp marketing on behalf of the partnership  with the appropriate records being made to account for amounts owed by the partnership to ffp marketing  or visa versa 
ffp marketing owed the partnership  and  at december  and  respectively 
these obligations of ffp marketing to the partnership accrued interest income to the partnership at an interest rate equal to the prime rate of interest 
assuming no additional properties are acquired or sold  based upon executed real estate leases  management projects that the partnership will receive rental income in from ffp marketing  per month plus  per month for the direct financing leases  and the partnership s debt service requirements in will be constant at  per month 
such amounts are shown before reduction for the minority interest of the harvison family in the subsidiary 
as a result of its forecast of positive cash flow  management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its obligations for general and administrative expenses from operations 
all of the partnership s real estate leases are triple net leases  providing for the tenant ffp marketing  and not the landlord the partnership  to pay all real estate taxes  insurance  operating and capital costs for the properties 
therefore  the partnership does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures on those properties 
in february  the partnership purchased additional improved real properties from a third party on which convenience stores and two truck stops are operational 
the partnership immediately leased the purchased properties to ffp marketing under real estate leases that are accounted for as operating leases for the land portion and as direct financing leases for the building portion 
these real estate leases provide for monthly rentals aggregating  for a year term  which equals the partnership s monthly principal and interest payments owed under its acquisition debt 
although related parties established such rental amounts  management believes that such amounts is consistent with market rates  however  no assurance can be given to that effect 
operating leases for the land portion of those payments have been allocated a monthly rental aggregating  and direct financing leases for the buildings portion have been allocated a monthly rental aggregating  these leases are triple net leases  under which the partnership pays no taxes  insurance  operating  or capital costs  and provide for an increase in rent payments after each five year period during the term of the leases based upon any increase in the consumers price index 
the partnership incurred long term acquisition debt in the original principal amount of  in connection with its february acquisition 
that debt is fully amortizable over years with equal  monthly payments of principal and interest 
ffp marketing was required to guarantee the partnership s acquisition indebtedness 
amounts owed on such indebtedness at december  and were  and  respectively 
in october  the partnership closed long term financing from a third party lender and repaid in full its long term indebtedness previously payable to ffp marketing 
the partnership executed a promissory note payable to the new lender in the amount of  plus a potential credit enhancement amount of up to  the note is fully amortizable over its year term with equal  monthly payments of principal  interest and credit enhancement charges in the amount of  this note bears interest at per annum 
the debt that the new loan refinanced required monthly principal payments of  plus accrued interest  and required a balloon payment of all unpaid principal in november if none of the loans with which the partnership s new loan is pooled incurs a default during the term of the loans  the lender will apply partnership s credit enhancement payments  if any  to reduce the principal balance of the note and result in a retirement of such debt in approximately years 
the payment of this note is secured by a deed of trust lien against properties of the partnership 
all of those properties are leased to ffp marketing with a year term 
amounts owed on such indebtedness at december  and were  and  respectively 
when the partnership repaid its debt to ffp marketing in october  ffp marketing also repaid all of its debt payable to the partnership that had been incurred when the partnership sold inventory and equipment to ffp marketing in february item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is not subject to a market risk related to variable interest rates because all of its long term financing is subject to fixed interest rates
