the project was conceived several years ago 
over that period of time there have been significant changes in technology 
the company is continuing to evaluate alternatives to more effectively provide for the information systems requirements of its various businesses 
segment discussion information technology services information technology services segment revenues increased during the segment experienced soft demand for its services during the first half of management attributes this softness to hesitancy by major customers to launch new spending programs on the heels of spending required to maintain year compliance 
during the second half of  information technology services experienced increased demand as customers initiated new systems projects  particularly to connect their new systems to the internet  and developed formal outsourcing strategies in such areas as console operations and help desk support 
in both and  one customer accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the segment s total revenues 
operating profit margins declined to in from in approximately  basis point decline in the margin is due to the applicable portion of the charges referred to in consolidated results above 
the segment invested in approximately additional recruiters and enhanced compensation programs to strengthen the unit s ability to attract and retain productive recruiters and compete in a very tight market for qualified technical talent 
the unit also incurred additional costs to implement a national staffing business model 
this effort included standardized practices  procedures and metrics 
management also launched its innovantage brand signaling its focus on both professional services and functional outsourcing 
while these initiatives negatively impacted operating profit margins in  management believes the investments are integral to the segment s longer term growth strategies 
the unit s focus is to leverage its innovantage service offering throughout its client base and to pursue new business opportunities in non manufacturing sectors where significant growth opportunities may exist 
technical services technical services segment revenues increased during this segment experienced solid increases in revenue  particularly during the first half of however  growth slowed during the second half of during the third quarter  revenues declined from the second quarter due largely to the termination of a high margin multi year telecommunications contract 
there was a significant reduction in requirements following the client s merger  which occurred on june  the contract was ultimately terminated in september additionally  during the fourth quarter  the technical services segment experienced a sharp and broad based reduction in demand for services in its aerospace  electronics computer  chemical  telecommunications  automotive and marine service lines 
operating profit margins declined to from in approximately  basis point decline in the margin is due to the applicable portion of the charges referred to in consolidated results above 
this segment has also made significant investments in its management infrastructure and operations support  particularly for its telecommunications group 
results were also negatively impacted by the third quarter termination of a high margin telecommunications contract referred to above 
the segment was unable to immediately adjust its cost structure to compensate for the loss of the contract 
technical services management is selectively pruning certain lower margin staffing business and is focusing its attention on its higher margin engineering services and telecommunications services product lines 
information technology services and technical services contracts are individually price negotiated  and as a result  the price to direct cost mix is constantly changing 
the cost structure of both segments is generally variable 
in periods of substantial increases in revenues  operating profits can widen because the segments can take advantage of certain economies of scale in the support cost structure 
conversely  in periods of declining demand  operating results can deteriorate quickly because realization of cost savings typically lags implementation of downsizing and cost reduction programs 
management recruiters management recruiters segment revenues increased during this unit has experienced strong demand in all geographic regions and growth in all key sales channels including company owned offices  franchised offices and their client services group  which services large block permanent placement assignments 
concerns over internet disintermediation  which arose in  have diminished as employers continue to require recruiter input in the permanent placement hiring process 
operating profit margins increased to from in the improvement in operating profit margin is attributable  in part  to a favorable recovery of a disputed contract payment totaling this recovery improved the operating profit margin in by basis points 
the segment s margin also improved due to continuing strong cost controls and strong performance by its franchisee organization 
this segment will continue to invest in technology to enhance the effectiveness of its recruiter network and improve its ability to match qualified applicants with open positions 
todays staffing todays staffing segment revenues increased during revenue growth began to decelerate after the first quarter of this slowdown was broad based and not geographic or industry specific 
the unit s slower revenue growth reflects the impact of an increasingly tighter labor market  making candidate recruiting more difficult and increasing turnover among the unit s recruiting and sales professionals  as a result of increased industry competition 
operating profit margins declined to in from in the slight decline in the operating profit margin is due  in part  to a decision to close two offices during  which resulted in a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately basis point decline in the margin 
in addition  during the year  the unit experienced higher than normal turnover among its staff  including recruiting professionals  and implemented a series of recruiting and retention measures resulting in higher costs 
todays staffing s strategy is to penetrate middle market opportunities to maintain strong margins  leverage internet based tools to enhance recruiter productivity and continue to expand its legal staffing business 
results of operations  year ended december  vs 
year ended december  consolidated results the company recorded consolidated revenues of  in  a increase over the level of  all operating segments achieved year over year growth in revenues 
gross profit increased by during  reflecting both improvements in volume and gross profit margins 
the gross profit margin improved to in from in this improvement in the margin is due to increasing selectivity in new contracts and the company s strategy to invest and grow its high margin businesses 
operating and administrative costs increased during as a percent of revenues  these costs were in and in the overall increase noted is due  in part  to recurring wage and salary increases within the company as well as increased costs for the company s enterprise wide information system 
operating profit increased during as a percentage of revenues  operating profit increased to in from in during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax charge of  to reorganize the technical services segment 
excluding these charges  the company s operating profit margin would have been 
interest expense increased during reflecting higher average levels of debt outstanding 
earnings from continuing operations were per share diluted compared to per share in excluding the reorganization charge referred to above  earnings from continuing operations would have been increased by 
per share resulting in per share earnings of 
net earnings for  including the impact of earnings from discontinued operations  was per share diluted vs 
per share in during the second and fourth quarters of  the company recorded gains from discontinued operations of  and  respectively  net of applicable income taxes 
these gains primarily reflected settlement of a disputed receivable that was fully reserved and adjustments of certain estimates 
in the fourth quarter of  a gain of  net of applicable income taxes  was recorded reflecting lower than anticipated costs related to the wind down of the discontinued operations and greater realization on disposal of assets than expected 
the liquidation of the discontinued operations was completed in during the year ended december   each of the company s business segments made acquisitions for which the company invested collectively  the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
goodwill acquired amounted to  and is being amortized on the straight line method over periods of and years 
these acquisitions did not have a significant effect upon reported earnings for segment discussion information technology services information technology services segment revenues increased during operationally  the segment completed its first full year as a stand alone business unit 
prior to mid  the company s information technology services business was integrated with the company s technical services segment 
information technology services customer base consists principally of large  multi national companies  much like the customer base of the company s technical services segment 
in both and  one large industrial customer comprised approximately of the segment s total revenues 
as a stand alone business unit  the segment has begun to broaden its customer and industry base and has already achieved a measure of success in the financial services industry 
demand began to moderate in the second half of within the segment s manufacturing oriented customer base as those customers faced global challenges in their markets 
during  many customers concerned with achieving year yk compliance responded by delaying discretionary information technology projects 
this softness was particularly evident during the fourth quarter of additionally  a tight labor supply  particularly for highly skilled information technology specialists  became even more acute in and this condition is not expected to subside substantially 
operating profit margins were in compared to in during  the company anticipated strong revenue growth  and therefore invested in management and support structure 
the anticipated growth did not materialize 
throughout  management carefully monitored its costs and transitioned from a regional management to a unified management structure and began implementation of standardized recruiting and career progression practices in all offices 
this effective emphasis on cost control  particularly during the second half of produced stronger profit margins than in technical services technical services segment revenues increased in the segment s customer base consists principally of large  multi national manufacturing companies 
historically  its largest markets have been aerospace  automotive  construction  electronics  industrial equipment  petrochemicals  marine  and telecommunications 
the segment has begun to penetrate the pharmaceuticals market  expand its level of business within telecommunications and is focusing on other new markets such as biotechnology  medical devices and food and beverage 
technical services revenue growth moderated during  in part  by continuing cyclical softness in the aerospace industry  reduced spending by certain key customers in the process of merger and increased contract selectivity and screening by technical services management 
operating profit margins for technical services increased to during from during the operating profit margins for are considered more reflective of this segment s overall historical performance 
in the second quarter of  technical services operating profit margins were impacted by reorganization costs and other non recurring charges of  excluding these charges in  the segment s operating profit margins would have been 
additionally  throughout  many technical services customers experienced a difficult business environment due to turbulent international market conditions  delayed new product introductions and investment imbalances 
this was particularly pronounced in the electronics and hydrocarbon and petrochemical customer base 
the improved results in reflect the higher margins associated with strengths in managed engineering services  targeted new market and product growth  increased contract selectivity and ongoing cost containment efforts 
information technology services and technical services many contracts are individually price negotiated  and as a result  the price to direct cost mix is constantly changing 
the cost structure of both segments is generally variable 
in periods of substantial increases in revenues  operating profits can widen because the segments can take advantage of certain economies of scale in the support cost structure 
conversely  in periods of declining demand  operating results can deteriorate quickly because realization of cost savings typically lags implementation of downsizing and cost reduction programs 
management recruiters management recruiters segment revenues increased during and was below the segment s rate of growth over the past few years 
the most significant cause of this slowing of growth is the severe shortage of middle management and professional personnel candidates for permanent employment positions 
those shortages are expected to continue into additionally  a certain amount of disintermediation is taking place as candidates and employers bypass recruiting organizations in favor of direct contact via the internet 
this latter effect cannot be quantified with certainty 
operating profit margins declined to in from in the decline in the margin reflects a shift in fulfillment mix from large client project placement work to more labor intensive single transaction searches 
further  margins also declined as a result of start up costs for four new staffing offices 
todays staffing todays staffing segment revenues increased in today staffing s customer base consists of a large number of retail accounts and a small number of large wholesale accounts 
these large  multi location accounts have become more price sensitive  and in the segment elected not to continue to pursue certain of these accounts when pricing began to erode 
conversely  the segment identified and won new  large contracts with a category of emerging middle market customers 
demand for office clerical and professional temporary services in remained strong 
legal staffing is a small but growing component of the segment s services 
todays staffing s operating profit margins were in both and operating profit in was adversely impacted by integration costs associated with today s acquisition of staffing consultants  inc and increased recruiting costs 
inflation the technical services  information technology services and todays staffing segments services are priced generally in close relationship with direct labor costs 
management recruiters middle management search services are priced as a function of salary levels of job candidates 
in recent years inflation has not been a meaningful factor 
liquidity and capital resources the company s main sources of liquidity are from operations and from borrowings  including unsecured committed revolving credit agreements with banks that provide for borrowings up to million 
in addition  the company has two uncommitted short term lines of credits with banks that total million 
borrowings are priced at floating rates of interest or are related to the banks costs of funds and  therefore  the company is subject to market risks as interest rates change see item a 
below 
these sources have been adequate to support growth opportunities in the company s businesses 
expansions and contractions in the levels at which the company s business operates can directly affect consolidated working capital  which in turn has a direct relationship to total capital employed because of the high concentration of total assets represented by current assets 
working capital decreased in because the company was able to reduce the collection cycle for accounts receivable and better manage its cash outflows 
cash flows from operating activities was  in and  in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to and to at december  and december   respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to capital long term debt plus shareholders equity at december  and was and  respectively 
during  investing activities resulted in cash outflows of  a  reduction from levels 
the primary reason for the decline in investing activities is attributable to lower acquisition activity 
cash outflows in associated with financing activities totaled  and primarily relate to repayments of long term debt 
in  the company had cash inflows of  principally related to incremental borrowings of long term debt used to fund increased levels of working capital  purchases of fixed assets and investments in acquisitions 
new accounting standards in september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement supercedes and replaces sfas no 
of the same name and provides guidance on securitization  sale and servicing of financial assets 
this standard will become effective for transactions entered into after march   however  companies that hold beneficial interests from previous securitizations are required to make additional disclosures in their december  financial statements 
the standard does not have any effect on the company as of december  impact in the future will depend on the company s future transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s only financial instruments are debt instruments  which primarily consist of its lines of credit 
the company does not actively manage its interest rate risk because the impact of a approximately basis points increase in interest rates on its variable rate debt using the year end debt balance and effective interest rates would have a relatively nominal after tax impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has no derivative or off balance sheet instruments
