financial overview the year ended december  represented a year of record earnings for the company as well as a year of growth 
the year was the first full year following the integration of nbsc and metropolitan 
during  the company acquired a leasing company  acquired a branch  opened a new branch  and planned the opening of three additional branches early in in comparing earnings with results in  merger related and restructuring charges in must be considered 
therefore  the reader should consider net income in two ways core earnings which exclude any one time charges  and net income which includes one time charges

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the interest cost of funds supporting those assets 
the company s net interest income is determined by i the volume of interest earning assets that it holds and the yields that it earns on those assets  and ii the volume of interest bearing liabilities that it has assumed and the rates that it pays on those liabilities 
net interest income increases when the company can use noninterest bearing deposits to fund or support interest earning assets 
net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million  representing an increase of million or from the million earned in net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million 
net interest income improved from to primarily because earning assets increased by million 
similarly  the increase in net interest income in from resulted from an increase in earning assets of million 
interest income and expense volume rate analysis 
the following table shows the impact that changes in average balances of the company s assets and liabilities and changes in average interest rates have had on the company s net interest income over the past three years 
this information is presented on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate 
if a change in interest income or expense is attributable to a change in volume and a change in rate  the amount of the change is allocated proportionately

b includes certificates of deposits and interest bearing cash accounts 
c net interest income divided by interest earning assets 
total interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in interest income in was due to a million increase in interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets 
the increase in yield reflected an increase in the overall rate environment in and also reflected a more favorable mix in earning assets 
the increase in interest earning assets was due to growth in the loan and investment portfolios 
the increase in interest income from million in to million in resulted from a million increase in earning assets which was partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield on earning assets caused by the decline in rates which occurred in and in the first half of total interest expense increased from million in to million in as a result of a million increase in interest bearing liabilities and a basis point increase in the company s cost of funds 
the increase in the cost of funds resulted from the increase of the overall interest rate environment in the year and from an increase in time deposits 
total interest expense increased from million in to million in as a result of a million increase in interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of funds 
net interest margin net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis by average interest earning assets 
the company s net interest margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin from to results from higher rates earned on loans and investment securities which more than offset higher rates paid on deposits 
the loan yield increased basis points  the yield on taxable investment securities increased basis points  and the yield on the tax exempt investment portfolio increased basis points 
the cost of funds increased basis points 
the decrease in the net interest margin from to resulted from a basis point decline in yields in the taxable investment portfolio and a basis point decline in the yield on the loan portfolio 
the average cost of the company s deposits was  and  for  and  respectively 
provision for possible loan losses in determining the provision for possible loan losses  management considers historical loan loss experience  changes in composition and volume of the portfolio  the level and composition of non performing loans  the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses  and prevailing economic conditions 
the provision for possible loan losses was million in  million in  and  in the increase in the provision from to was due to management s evaluation of the loan portfolio

net charge offs decreased from million in to  in net charge offs as a percent of average loans outstanding decreased from in to in the provision for possible loan losses at million increased from  in the increase in the provision for possible loan losses was due to an increase in net charge offs from to and included a  provision made to conform provisioning policies among subsidiary banks 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding was in noninterest income noninterest income increased million or to million in from million in and represented of total income for total income includes net interest income plus noninterest income 
the primary source of this increase was million in gains on sales of leases generated from the company s leasing division which was purchased early in second quarter also contributing to the increase in noninterest income were higher service charges collected on deposit accounts 
commissions and fees increased from  in to million in the increase in commissions and fees resulted primarily from an increase in loan fees and in commissions and fees on investment services 
other income decreased from million in to  in as a result of decreases in gains on sales of loans 
noninterest income increased  or to million in from million in and represented of total income for noninterest income increased from to as a result of increased service fees collected on deposit accounts and due to fees generated by the introduction of a debit card at one of the company s subsidiaries 
noninterest expense noninterest expenses in decreased million or over included in the expense is million in merger related and restructuring charges 
excluding merger related charges  noninterest expense increased from million to million  an  or increase 
salaries and benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  increased by  or 
normal merit increases and costs related to the addition of the leasing division were offset by decreased medical expenses and declines in staffing related to the acquisitions of nbsc and metropolitan as positions were consolidated 
other expense categories increased in the aggregate by  or 
other expenses increased due to increased costs of occupancy  furniture and equipment related to the addition of new branches  costs related to the leasing division and improvements in technology 
noninterest expense in increased million or over included in noninterest expense were million in one time merger related charges related to the acquisitions of nbsc and metropolitan 
salaries and benefits increased by million or resulting from increased medical claim expense  normal salary increases and the addition of new people to the executive management team 
other expense categories increased in the aggregate by  or resulting from costs related to operating and disposing of other real estate and from increases in telephone expenses and marketing expense 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by total revenue 
in  the company s efficiency ratio improved to from in excluding merger related charges and in due to cost savings following the merger of metropolitan and nbsc 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was  and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate dropped from in to in due to merger related expenses recorded in which were not tax deductible 
financial condition total assets increased from million on december  to million on december   an increase of million  or  resulting from growth in the loan portfolio and investment portfolio 
total assets at year end increased million or from year end loans the banks primarily serve bergen  morris  passaic  sussex and essex counties in northern new jersey and the surrounding areas 
all of the bank s borrowers are us residents or entities 
total loans increased from million on december  to million on december   an increase of million or 
the increase in loans generally was in the consumer portfolio which increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
in  the company purchased approximately million in consumer loan portfolios which contributed to this increase 
the real estate mortgage portfolio also increased million or 
in  total loans increased million to million as a result of mortgage growth generated by metropolitan which began offering mortgages for the first time 
the following table sets forth the classification of the company s loans by major category as of december for each of the last five years december  in thousands commercial      real estate mortgage      real estate contruction      home equity and consumer installment      the following table shows the percentage distributions of loans by category as of december for each of the last five years 
december  commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction home equity and consumer installment at december   there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans outstanding other than loans that are secured by real estate 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth certain categories of loans as of december   in terms of contractual maturity due after one within but within after five in thousands one year five years years total types of loans commercial     real estate construction    total     amount of such loans with predetermined rates     floating or adjustable rates     total     risk elements commercial loans are placed on a non accrual status with all accrued interest and unpaid interest reversed if a because of the deterioration in the financial position of the borrower they are maintained on a cash basis which means payments are applied when and as received rather than on a regularly scheduled basis  b payment in full of interest or principal is not expected  or c principal and interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both well secured and in process of collection 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time when foreclosure proceedings are commenced except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received 
the following schedule sets forth certain information regarding the company s non accrual  past due and renegotiated loans and other real estate owned as of december  for each of the last five years december  in thousands non performing loans non accrual loans a      past due loans b      renegotiated loans c total non performing loans      other real estate owned    total non performing assets      nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets a generally represents loans as to which the payment of interest or principal is in arrears for a period of more than ninety days 
current policy requires that interest previously accrued on these loans and not yet paid be reversed and charged against interest income during the current period 
b represents loans as to which payments of interest or principal are contractually past due ninety days or more  but which are currently accruing income at the contractually stated rates 
a determination is made to continue accruing income on such loans only if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course and collection efforts are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status 
c the loan portfolio includes loans whose terms have been renegotiated due to financial difficulties of borrowers 
all such loans are reviewed quarterly to determine if they are performing in accordance with the renegotiated terms 
non accrual loans decreased  to million at december   from million at december  all of these loans are in various stages of litigation  foreclosure  or workout 
loans past due ninety days or more and still accruing decreased  to million at december   from million at december  for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded  had the loans classified at year end as either non accrual or renegotiated been performing in conformance with their original loan terms  is approximately  the amount of interest income actually recorded on those loans for was  the resultant income loss of  for compares to losses of  and gains of  for and  respectively 
loans specifically evaluated are deemed impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
loans which are in process of collection will not be classified as impaired 
a loan is not impaired during the process of collection of payment if the company expects to collect all amounts due  including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate 
all commercial loans identified as impaired are evaluated by an independent loan review consultant 
the company aggregates consumer loans and residential mortgages for evaluation purposes 
the company s policy concerning non accrual loans states that  except for loans which are considered to be fully collectible by virtue of collateral held and in the process of collection  loans are placed on a non accrual status when payments are days delinquent or more 
it is possible for a loan to be on non accrual status and not be classified as impaired if the balance of such loan is relatively small and  therefore  that loan has not been specifically reviewed for impairment 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off in the period that the loss is identified 
until such time  an allowance for loan loss is maintained for estimated losses 
with regard to interest income recognition for payments received on impaired loans  as well as all non accrual loans  the company follows regulatory guidelines  which apply any payments to principal as long as there is doubt as to the collectibility of the loan balance 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the company had impaired loans totaling million including million in non accrual loans 
the impairment of these loans is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for these loans 
based upon such evaluation   has been allocated to the allowance for possible loan losses for impairment 
at december   the company also had million in loans that were rated substandard that were not classified as non performing or impaired 
there were no loans at december   other than those designated non performing  impaired or substandard  where the company was aware of any credit conditions of any borrowers that would indicate a strong possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in such loans being included as non accrual  past due or renegotiated at a future date 
the following table sets forth for each of the five years ended december   the historical relationships among the amount of loans outstanding  the allowance for possible loan losses  the provision for possible loan losses  the amount of loans charged off and the amount of loan recoveries december  in thousands balance of the allowance at the beginning of the year      loans charged off commercial     home equity and consumer real estate mortgage total loans charged off     recoveries commercial home equity and consumer real estate construction real estate mortgage total recoveries net charge offs   provision for possible loan losses charged to operations    ending balance      ratio of net charge offs to average loans oustanding ratio of allowance at end of year as a percentage of year end total loans the ratio of the allowance for possible loan losses to loans outstanding reflects management s evaluation of the underlying credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria 
the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified criticized loans that have been designated as requiring attention by the company s external loan review program 

the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 

the establishment of reserve amounts for the non criticized loans in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios 

an allocation for all off balance sheet exposures 
consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all accompanying factors related to the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for possible loan losses to be adequate at december  the following table shows how the allowance for possible loan losses is allocated among the various types of loans that the company has outstanding 
this allocation is based on management s specific review of the credit risk of the outstanding loans in each category as well as historical trends 
at december  in thousands commercial      home equity and consumer   real estate construction real estate mortgage  investment securities the company has classified its investment securities into the available for sale and held to maturity categories pursuant to sfas no

one membership benefit is that members can borrow overnight funds 
lakeland and nbsc have respective credit lines of million and million at the fhlb 
lakeland has overnight federal funds lines available for it to borrow up to million 
management of the subsidiary banks believe that their current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet their current and anticipated operational needs 
the banks anticipate that they will have sufficient funds available to meet their current loan commitments and deposit maturities 
at december   the banks had outstanding loan origination commitments of million 
time deposits that mature in one year or less  at december   totaled million 
the first sentence in this paragraph constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including uncertainties relating to general economic conditions  unanticipated decreases in deposits  changes in or failure to comply with governmental regulations  and uncertainties relating to the analysis of the company s assessment of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and relating to the extent to which market factors indicate that a financial institution such as lakeland should match such assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is often measured by the extent to which mismatches or gaps occur in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
gap analysis is utilized to quantify such mismatches 
a positive gap results when the amount of earning assets repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within that time period 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of earning assets repricing within such time period 
in general  a financial institution with a positive gap in relevant time periods will benefit from an increase in market interest rates and will experience erosion in net interest income if such rates fall 
likewise  a financial institution with a negative gap in relevant time periods will normally benefit from a decrease in market interest rates and will be adversely affected by an increase in rates 
by maintaining a balanced interest rate sensitivity position  where interest rate sensitive assets roughly equal interest sensitive liabilities in relevant time periods  interest rate risk can be limited 
as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer and certain other senior officers 
this committee meets monthly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 
the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of traditional interest rate sensitivity analysis also known as gap analysis and an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
traditional gap analysis involves arranging the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods and then computing the difference or interest rate sensitivity gap between the assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice during each time period and cumulatively through the end of each time period 
both interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis are done at a specific point in time and involve a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
gap analysis requires estimates as to when individual categories of interest sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice  and assumes that assets and liabilities assigned to the same repricing period will reprice at the same time and in the same amount 
gap analysis does not account for the fact that repricing of assets and liabilities is discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity repricing structure of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  except as stated below  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability 
the majority of interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits are assumed to be core deposits  or deposits that will remain at the company regardless of market interest rates 
therefore  of the interest bearing deposits and of the savings deposits are shown as maturing or repricing in the after but within years column 
lakeland has assumed that all interest bearing demand accounts and savings accounts will reprice or mature within five years 
the table does not assume any prepayment of fixed rate loans 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a stated period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
maturing or repricing after within three months but after but after december  months within year within years years total interest earning assets in thousands loans      investment securities      federal funds sold and interest bearing cash accounts   total earning assets      interest bearing liabilities deposits interest bearing demand     savings accounts     time deposits      total interest bearing deposits      borrowings repurchase agreements    long term debt    total borrowings     total liabilities      interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative rate sensitivity gap     changes in estimates and assumptions made for interest rate sensitivity modeling and gap analysis could have a significant impact on projected results and conclusions 
therefore  these techniques may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
because of the limitations in the gap analysis discussed above  members of the company s asset liability management committee believe that the interest sensitivity modeling more accurately reflects the effects and exposure to changes in interest rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the company s net portfolio value at december  using current discount rates  and an estimate of net interest income for assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at december  levels 
the rate shock information in the table shows estimates of net portfolio value at december  and net interest income for assuming fluctuations or rate shocks of plus and basis points and minus and basis points 
rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately

this reclassification was made in the first quarter of the fdic s risk based capital policy statement imposes a minimum capital standard on insured banks 
the minimum ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill tier i capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses 
the federal reserve board has adopted a similar risk based capital guideline for the company which is computed on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the bank regulators have adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines tier i capital to average quarterly assets  less goodwill for financial institutions 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
all other holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points

effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
lakeland attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manage its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  thus minimizing the potential effects of inflation
