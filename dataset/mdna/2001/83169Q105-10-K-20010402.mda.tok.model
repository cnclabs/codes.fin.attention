item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
except for historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
such risks and uncertainties are discussed under the caption forward looking statements in item of this form k 
results of operations general prior to  we were primarily a development stage company with limited revenues 
we did not begin to recognize significant revenues from our digital connectivity products  specifically flashpath  until mid during  we acquired vst technologies  or vst  and impleo limited  or impleo  which provided us with a line of personal storage products and greater access to the european market 
these transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
because of the development stage nature of our operations prior to mid and the acquisitions of vst and impleo during  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results are meaningful or predictive of future performance 
effective october   we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december our adoption of sab no 
 as amended  did not have a material effect on the results of operations during the year ended december  comparison of years ended december  and revenues our product revenues are recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we defer recognition of revenue on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors have resold the products 
we record a provision for estimated product returns at the time the related revenue is recognized on sales to certain resellers that have rights of return 
product revenues at our japanese subsidiary are recognized upon acceptance by the customer 
total product revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to sales of personal storage systems subsequent to the acquisition of vst in march and an increase in sales of our digital connectivity products 
for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december   revenues from personal storage systems were approximately million 
sales of personal storage systems declined in the fourth quarter of  primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of our usb and firewire based personal storage products for the apple market resulting from the recent decrease in demand for that market 
we plan to discontinue some lower margin or non strategic personal storage products in our product revenues from the sale of digital connectivity products increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for year ended december  we are starting to see the anticipated decline in the use of the inch floppy drive as a flash memory card interface  as consumers move toward devices with higher data transfer rates  such as our usb based flash media readers 
this is contributing to the slow growth in sales of our flashpath products 
we expect revenues from digital connectivity products to be flat or somewhat lower than revenues 
our research and development revenue is recognized upon final customer acceptance of our work performed under the terms of the agreement 
we earned the significant portion of our research and development revenues from a research and development agreement  which was completed during the quarter ended march  our total revenues from research and development agreements were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  we intend to enter into additional research and development agreements for the development of new technologies 
our license fees and royalty revenues primarily consist of fees earned from license agreements on our safeboot and flashtrax intellectual property 
currently  these revenues represent less than two percent of our total revenues for the year ended december  we intend to enter into additional licensing agreements for our existing and future intellectual property 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the purchased cost of product  packaging  storage  freight  scrap and inventory provisions  as well as royalties for some of our digital connectivity products and personal storage systems 
cost of revenues increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase in cost was due primarily to sales of personal storage systems subsequent to the acquisition of vst and an increase in sales of our digital connectivity products 
for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december   cost of revenues from sales of personal storage products was approximately million 
this amount includes approximately million of inventory writedowns in the fourth quarter arising from the recent decrease in demand for personal storage products 
our cost of revenues from the sales of digital connectivity products increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume of our digital connectivity products 
in addition  part of this increase was due to inventory writedowns of approximately million associated with our smarty smart card reader due to our discontinuance of that product line 
gross profit our gross profit for the year ended december  increased to approximately million or of total revenue  compared to approximately million or of total revenue for the year ended december  this increase in the amount of gross profit is primarily attributable to sales of personal storage systems subsequent to the acquisition of vst in march  which also contributed to the decrease in our gross margin percentage since the gross margin on personal storage products is typically less than on digital connectivity products 
in addition  we recognized inventory writedowns primarily on our personal storage products during the fourth quarter of  which reduced margins from approximately to the reported 
for the period from march   the date we acquired vst  through december   gross profit from sales of personal storage systems was approximately million or of personal storage revenue 
this amount includes inventory writedowns in the fourth quarter arising from the recent decrease in demand for personal storage products 
excluding the inventory writedowns  the margins on our personal storage products would have been approximately 
we expect margins on our personal storage products to approximate this percentage going forward 
however  if we are able to shift a significant portion of the manufacturing of our personal storage products overseas  we expect margins for these products to improve 
our gross profit from sales of digital connectivity products for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million or of digital connectivity revenue  compared to approximately million or of digital connectivity revenue for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to inventory writedowns associated with our smarty smart card reader due to our discontinuance of that product line 
because we expect original equipment manufacturers oems to continue to account for a large portion of our digital connectivity sales  we expect gross margins on those sales to remain relatively consistent with the current level 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and payroll related expenses for our design and development engineers  as well as prototype supplies and contract or professional services 
these expenses increased to approximately million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this increase in expenditures was primarily attributable to the acquisition of vst  as well as hiring additional technical personnel  including salaries and related payroll expenses  costs incurred in conjunction with our research and development contracts and the outsourcing of product development 
research and development expenses related to digital connectivity products were incurred to support the development of our usb flash media reader  other products to transfer digital content from flash memory cards to non pc technologies and enhanced versions of our flashpath products 
research and development expenses related to our personal storage products were incurred for the development of our usb firewire combo hard disk drive for windows  a bus powered firewire cd r w and higher capacity thin firewire hard disk drives 
we believe that the continued introduction of new products with an emphasis on being first to market is important to our growth and will require increases in research and development expenditures 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we invest in the development of software applications and new and refined digital connectivity and personal storage products to conveniently create  transfer  store  manage and use digital content 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include salaries  benefits and travel expenses for our sales  marketing and product management personnel in the united states  japan and the united kingdom 
these expenses also include other selling and marketing expenditures for items such as trade shows  advertising  marketing and other promotional programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change from to was primarily attributable to the acquisition of vst and impleo 
with the acquisition of vst in march and the acquisition of impleo in april  we added a number of new products to our existing product lines  significantly increasing our total sales and marketing expenses 
these added products require more catalog and magazine advertising than we have needed in the past due to our oem relationships 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in the future as we launch new products and broaden our distribution into more traditional consumer electronic and mass retail channels 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and related expenses of our executive management  finance  information systems  operations  technical support  human resources  legal and administrative functions  as well as leases  utilities  maintenance  insurance  professional services  legal and accounting fees  depreciation and amortization 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of vst and impleo  as well as increases in depreciation and amortization  professional services  and legal and accounting fees 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized non recurring expenses of approximately million for costs associated with a withdrawn secondary stock offering  employee severance and the forgiveness of a note receivable 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets as of december   our intangible assets primarily consisted of goodwill and separately identified intangible assets recognized in connection with our acquisitions completed in  which were recorded under the purchase method of accounting 
the separately identified intangible assets acquired consist of non compete agreements  distribution channels  trade names  patents and workforce in place 
these intangible assets have lives ranging from one to five years from the date of acquisition 
purchase price not allocated to separately identified intangible assets was allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is amortized over a five year life from the date of acquisition 
for the year ended december   amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets totaled approximately million 
interest and other income interest and other income increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the primary components of interest and other income are interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment and gains or losses on foreign exchange 
the most significant component of these items  for the year ended december   was interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  which was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase in interest income is due to a full year of interest earned on the proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  in october  less net proceeds primarily used for acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense is incurred on the bank line of credit in japan and the united kingdom 
we also incurred interest expense on vst s line of credit until it was paid in full on march  interest expense for the year ended december  remained consistent at approximately million compared to the year ended december  income tax expense benefit we are subject to tax in the united states  japan  switzerland and the united kingdom 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
for the year ended december   income tax benefit totaled approximately million 
this amount consisted of income tax benefits of approximately million primarily resulting from amortization expense on certain intangible assets related to the vst and impleo acquisitions partially offset by approximately million of expense 
due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have a net deferred tax liability of approximately million 
based on our limited operating history and the cumulative losses from the most recent three years  a valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of december  we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes and approximately million for united kingdom income tax purposes 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total product revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of our flashpath for smartmedia product  which we commercially introduced in mid  and  to a lesser extent  sales of our newest product  flashpath for the sony memory stick  which we commercially introduced in the fourth quarter of our product revenues from the sale of flashpath increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our smarty sales to approximately  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the growth of our flashpath revenues and the decrease in smarty sales  smarty revenues represented less than of product revenues for the year ended december  compared to approximately in the year ended december  fiscal year was the first year that we had revenues from our research and development efforts 
during  we entered into agreements with a technology company for the development of new products 
upon acceptance of the products by the customer in the fourth quarter of  we recognized approximately million in revenue 
our license fee and royalty revenue from the sale of our safeboot product increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  these increases in cost were due primarily to the increase in sales of our flashpath product 
gross profit our gross profit for the year ended december  increased to approximately million or of total revenue  compared to approximately million or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase in our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of revenue growth and improved margins on our flashpath product 
the improved flashpath product margins achieved in were related to our efforts to reduce our cost per unit and a favorable mix associated with higher shipments to customers other than our largest oems 
another contributor to our improved gross profit in was our research and development revenue 
without the research and development revenue  our gross profit would have been approximately of total revenue 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the hiring of additional technical personnel  including salaries and related payroll expenses  costs incurred in conjunction with a research and development contract and the outsourcing of product development 
all of these expenses were to support our development of enhanced versions of our flashpath for smartmedia product  as well as our development of flashpath products designed to work with the sony memory stick and the sandisk multimediacard 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased by less than million to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the change from year to year reflects various additional costs incurred in in connection with the introduction of the flashpath for smartmedia product including salaries and payroll related expenses associated with the opening of our tokyo  japan office in march general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in professional services  legal fees and personnel related costs including salaries  bonuses and relocation expenses 
interest and other income interest expense the significant component of interest and other income was interest earned on the proceeds from our ipo in october the average outstanding balance on the line of credit in japan remained consistent between and  therefore  interest expense remained consistent between years 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   we provided for japanese withholding tax of approximately million on royalty income from japan 
we also provided for japanese income tax of approximately million due to income earned in japan 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from approximately million and million used in financing activities and investing activities  respectively  offset in part by approximately million provided by operating activities 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we have approximately million in short term investments and approximately million in restricted cash of which a portion was used as collateral for our line of credit in japan 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operations of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities during reflected a net loss of approximately million offset by approximately million in depreciation and amortization along with approximately million in provisions for uncollectible accounts  sales returns and other credits and inventory obsolescence 
in addition  there were decreases in notes receivable of approximately million and an increase in deferred research and development contract revenue of approximately million 
these amounts were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of approximately million  inventory of approximately million  prepaid and other current assets of approximately million and decreases in accounts payable of approximately million  income taxes payable of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million and million for the years ended december  and the most significant use of cash in was approximately million in connection with the acquisitions of vst  impleo  and substantially all of the intellectual property of el gato 
this amount was offset by proceeds from the sale of short term investments  net of purchases  of approximately million 
cash was also used for capital expenditures of approximately million  primarily for the acquisition of development and production equipment  net of disposals 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of approximately and million for the years ended december  and this was attributable to approximately million in net repayments under our line of credit with a japanese bank and approximately million used to repay the outstanding balance under vst s line of credit  which was terminated 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee share purchases 
during and  we financed our operations and repaid loans outstanding through short term borrowings and the sale of equity securities in private placements with several strategic investors 
the main contributor to the cash provided in was the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock in our ipo in october during  we financed our operations  acquisitions and repaid loans outstanding with a portion of the proceeds from our ipo 
we maintain a line of credit in the united states under which we may borrow up to million subject to a borrowing base agreement  which includes not more than of specified accounts receivable 
any amounts borrowed under this line of credit bear interest at over the day libor rate and are secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we had not borrowed against this line of credit 
this line of credit expires in april  at which time we plan to renew it 
as of december   our japanese subsidiary had a line of credit with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million  which was secured by accounts receivable of specified trade customers and a time deposit 
the outstanding balance under the line of credit was approximately million as of december  compared to approximately million at december  this line of credit was renewed in january the maximum borrowing capacity was decreased to approximately million 
the line of credit is secured by accounts receivable of specified trade customers and a time deposit and expires in february the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is per year 
our japanese subsidiary also discounts certain short term promissory notes received from certain trade customers with a bank in japan 
the subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings collateralized by promissory notes as of december  at december   the subsidiary had approximately million of bank borrowings collateralized by promissory notes 
as of december   our uk subsidiary had a line of credit with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
the credit facility expires in april the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is per year 
the outstanding balance under the line of credit as of december  was approximately million 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  credit facility and the remaining net proceeds of our ipo  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and anticipated capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we may need to raise additional capital if we expand more rapidly than currently planned  to develop and market new or enhanced products and or services  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
the capital  if needed  may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
factors that may affect future results of operations our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following 
in addition  the following factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  whether made in this form k  our annual or quarterly reports to shareholders  future press releases  sec filings or orally  whether in presentations  responses to questions or otherwise 
see forward looking statements 
we have incurred net losses and cannot guarantee that we will be profitable in the future 
except for the third and fourth quarters of  we have incurred net losses on a quarterly basis since inception 
we had net income of approximately million during we had a net loss of approximately million during  primarily as a result of million in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from the vst and impleo acquisitions  net of tax 
in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in light of our loss history and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from the vst and impleo acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future 
we have a limited operating history on which to base an investment decision 
we were incorporated in march  commenced operations in january  and our predecessor corporation only conducted limited operations 
as a result of our limited operating history  we have limited financial data that can be used in evaluating our business and prospects and in projecting future operating results 
we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our products to sustain a viable business if the market for digital connectivity products does not continue to develop or if a competing technology displaces these products 
our current flashpath products and other flash media readers are designed to provide connectivity between personal computers and digital appliances that use flash memory cards 
the flash memory market is in the early stage of development and is still evolving 
our current dependence on sales of flashpath exposes us to a substantial risk of loss in the event that the flash memory market does not develop or if a competing technology replaces flash memory cards 
if a competing memory storage device replaces or takes significant market share from the flash memory cards which our digital connectivity products support  we will not be able to sell our products in quantities sufficient to grow our business 
we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our digital connectivity products to sustain our current business if a single standard for flash memory cards emerges 
we believe that demand for our flash memory connectivity products is driven  to a large extent  by the absence of a single standard for flash memory cards 
there are currently five major flash memory cards  none of which has emerged as the industry standard 
should one of these cards or a new technology emerge as an industry standard  flash memory card readers could be built into pcs  eliminating the need for our current flash memory connectivity products 
a reduction in the use of the inch floppy disk drive by consumers and manufacturers is contributing to the slow growth in sales of our flashpath products 
our current flashpath products only work in conjunction with the standard inch floppy disk drive 
while the inch floppy disk drive is found today in most pcs  a number of newer pc models  such as the apple imac and the apple g desktop  do not have this device and new industry standards may emerge that render the inch floppy disk drive obsolete 
advances in input devices such as cd rom and removable data storage disk drives  such as zip drives  are reducing the need for the inch floppy diskette  which is contributing to the slow growth in sales of our flashpath products 
in the future  we will have to rely on our other products and develop new products that use a different interface between personal computers and digital appliances 
since our flashpath products work only in conjunction with the inch floppy disk drive  advances in flash memory cards may make these products less competitive because of the increased time needed to transfer data using the inch floppy disk drive 
consumer acceptance of our flashpath products will depend upon their ability to quickly transfer information from flash memory cards to pcs 
however  the time needed to transfer information using a inch disk drive increases as more data is transferred 
as more memory is condensed on to flash memory cards  the time necessary to transfer all of the data from a single card will increase 
as technological advances make it possible and feasible to produce higher density cards  our ability to create products  which quickly transfer all of the stored information on a single card will be constrained by the inherent limitations of the inch disk drive 
in that case  our products would be less attractive to consumers and our sales would decline 
we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our personal storage systems to sustain our future growth if pc manufacturers do not adopt ieee as a high speed peripheral interface or if a competing cpu interface displaces or prevents the widespread adoption of ieee a substantial portion of our business depends on the adoption of institute of electrical and electronics engineering  or ieee  technology by pc manufacturers 
ieee is a high speed pc interface that is replacing small computer system interface  or scsi  and parallel interfaces 
if these manufacturers do not include a ieee interface on their pcs or notebook computers  then we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our firewire personal storage systems to support our future growth 
firewire is apple s trade name for ieee for example  a new  competing high speed interface  such as universal serial bus  or usb   could be developed and emerge as an industry standard  thus limiting the demand for our firewire technology and related personal storage systems 
we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our personal storage systems to support our business if suppliers of our drives develop native firewire based personal storage systems that do not require our firewire conversion technology 
we embed conversion asics and integrated software drivers in the hard disk drives and zip drives we obtain from our suppliers  which enables our firewire based personal storage systems to be used with firewire equipped computers 
we license this technology and the firmware from lsi logic 
if our suppliers were to develop a native firewire solution that does not require the conversion asics and drivers embedded in our products  then we may not be able to sell sufficient quantities of our firewire personal storage systems to support our business 
most of our revenues are derived from only a few major products and our business will be seriously harmed if demand for those products declines 
to date  substantially all of our revenue has been derived from the sale of only a few major products 
while our long term strategy is to derive revenue from multiple products  we anticipate that the sale of our flashpath products and our usb and firewire storage systems will continue to represent the most substantial portion of our revenues through at least a decline in the price of or demand for these products as a result of competition  technological change  the introduction of new products by us or others  a failure to adequately manage product transitions  or for other reasons  would seriously harm our business 
during  we derived approximately of our product revenues from the sale of flashpath  from the sale of our usb based personal storage systems  and from the sale of our firewire based personal storage systems 
we must develop new products and introduce them in a timely manner in order to remain competitive 
we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance products that shorten product life cycles 
to be competitive in this demanding market  we must both continue to refine current products so that they remain competitive  and continually design  develop and introduce  in a timely manner  new products that meet the performance and price demands of oems and consumers 
these development activities will require the investment of substantial resources before revenues are derived from product sales 
any significant delay in releasing new products would adversely affect our reputation  provide a competitor a first to market opportunity or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
product development is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in technology  coordinate our technical personnel and strategic relationships  and identify and eliminate design flaws 
if we are unable to develop and sell new products  we will not be able to continue our strategy of maintaining media neutrality  and our target market will be limited 
further  we may not be able to recoup research and development expenditures if new products are not widely commercially accepted 
we may not be able to develop or maintain the strategic relationships necessary to provide us with the insight we need to develop commercially viable products 
we may not be able to produce commercially viable products if we are unable to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of flash memory card  pc and digital appliance manufacturers 
we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers  our oem manufacturers and our other contract manufacturers to ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner 
this collaboration is also important because our ability to anticipate trends and plan our product development activities depends to a significant degree upon our continued access to information derived from these strategic relationships 
we currently rely on strategic relationships with flash memory card manufacturers  such as sony  sandisk and toshiba  pc manufacturers  such as apple  and consumer product oems  such as olympus and fujifilm 
for example  through our co development efforts with sony  we developed our flashpath for the sony memory stick and introduced a follow on flashpath product for new models of sony s mavica digital still camera a few months later 
if we cannot maintain our relationship with these manufacturers then we may not be able to continue to develop products that are compatible with their flash memory cards  pcs and digital appliances 
however  collaboration is more difficult because many of these companies are located overseas 
if any of our current relationships deteriorates or is terminated  or if we are unable to enter into future alliances that provide us with comparable insight into market trends  we will be hindered in our ability to produce commercially viable products 
for example  we depend on our relationship with iomega corporation in order to produce our zip drive products for apple notebook computers 
if we cannot maintain our relationship with iomega  or if iomega wishes to produce these products internally  then our current market for these products will deteriorate 
we may not be able to sustain our relationship with apple computer  which would greatly hinder our ability to timely develop products  which are compatible with macintosh operating systems 
historically  apple has provided us  as an apple developer  access to selected product road maps  which has allowed us to timely develop and engineer many of our current products  including our current firewire and usb storage systems 
as a result of this collaborative relationship  we have received a substantial portion of our historical revenues from direct sales to apple and apple users 
moreover  we anticipate that a significant portion of our product revenues will continue to be derived from sales of our apple compatible products in the near future 
if apple were to terminate our status as an apple developer or if there were a material deterioration of our relationship  we would not be able to timely develop new technologies that are compatible with apple s product road maps and this would have an adverse effect on our business 
moreover  we currently sell a number of our apple products through the apple web store  where our products may be sold separately or may be configured and ordered along with a macintosh computer 
while we do not anticipate any change in this arrangement  apple is not contractually obligated to offer our products on their website 
a continued decline in the demand for apple products would further reduce the market for many of our products 
our continued growth depends to a large extent on both our strategic relationship with apple and demand for apple products 
this dependence is due primarily to the fact that  to date  apple has been the principal pc manufacturer using the firewire interface technology on which many of our products are based 
the recent decline in demand for apple products has contributed to the slow growth in sales of our personal storage products in the second half of if the decline in the demand for apple products continues or if apple suffers a material change in its business  the market for many of our products would be further negatively impacted 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly and may fluctuate significantly in the future  which could lead to decreases in our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
if our future operating results materially fluctuate or are below the expectations of stock market analysts  our stock price would likely decline 
future fluctuations may result from a variety of factors including the following bullet the timing and amount of orders we receive from our customers  which may be tied to seasonal demand for the consumer products manufactured and sold by oems  bullet cancellations or delays of customer product orders  or the loss of a significant customer  bullet reductions in consumer demand for our customers products in general  such as apple products  or for our products in particular  such as flashpath  bullet the timing and amount of research and development expenditures  bullet the availability of manufacturing capacity necessary to make our products  bullet general business conditions in the united states  japan and europe  as well as general economic and political conditions  bullet any new product introductions  or delays in product introductions  by us or our competitors  bullet increased costs charged by our suppliers or changes in the delivery of products to us  bullet increased competition or reductions in the average selling prices that we are able to charge  bullet fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen and british pound  against the us dollar  and bullet changes in our product mix as well as possible seasonal demand for our products 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not a good predictor of our future performance 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology companies 
recently  the market price of our common stock  like that of many technology companies  has experienced significant fluctuations 
for instance  from october   the date of our ipo  to february   the reported last sale price for our common stock ranged from to per share 
on february   the reported last sale price of our common stock was per share 
the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors 
reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views 
the fact that we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not necessarily mean that we will do so in the future 
we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and  therefore  lose our competitive advantage 
our proprietary technology with respect to inch floppy disk drive interfaces and usb and firewire source codes is critical to our future growth 
we rely in part on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
however  the patents issued to us may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
we have  in fact  filed a complaint against one of our former patent attorneys for improperly copying one of our patent applications and filing a patent application without our consent naming himself as a co inventor 
this matter was settled with no materially adverse consequences to smartdisk 
in addition  we may not receive trademark protection for our smartdisk name 
we have filed for trademark registration of the name smartdisk  but this has not yet been granted 
we are aware of a trademark application for the name smartdisk that was filed by another company 
our application could be denied and we could be prohibited from using the smartdisk name 
in that event  we would be required to incur substantial costs to establish new name recognition 
we also claim copyright protection for some proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
however  despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and software that we regard as proprietary 
those parties may have substantially greater financial resources than we have  and we may not have the resources available to challenge their use of our proprietary technology 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  it will be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
we may face competition from intel if it decides to utilize its competing patent 
intel corporation was issued a patent in disclosing and claiming technology substantially similar to that disclosed in one of our key patents 
the intel patent was filed four years after our effective filing date  and we do not believe that the intel patent can be validly applied to any of the technology disclosed in our patent 
however  given the substantial resources available to intel  our financial condition could suffer if we engage in a dispute with intel 
our business could also be harmed if intel s patent is determined to be valid and intel or any licensee of intel decides to sue our customers or develop and commercialize products based on its patent 
infringement claims by third parties could result in costly litigation and otherwise adversely impact our business 
from time to time we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of these third parties 
these claims of infringement may result in protracted and costly litigation that could require us to pay substantial damages or have sales of our products stopped by an injunction 
infringement claims could also cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
for example  we received communications alleging that our flashpath products infringed a third party s patent rights 
we have met with this third party  a non public limited liability company  to gain a better understanding of its claim and attempted to resolve the dispute through mediation 
such mediation did not yield a resolution to the dispute and such party subsequently filed a complaint in the central district federal court of the state of california see part i  item legal proceedings 
while we believe that we do not infringe upon this third party s patent and that such claim is wholly without merit  we cannot guarantee that the effects or outcome of this litigation will be favorable to smartdisk 
we also received correspondence alleging that our safeboot product violated another third party s intellectual property rights 
we discussed this correspondence with counsel and concluded that our product does not infringe upon the third party s rights 
in addition  we license a portion of the intellectual property included in our products from third parties  which may increase our exposure to infringement actions because we rely upon those third parties for information about the origin and ownership of the licensed intellectual property 
we may also lose our license rights with respect to the intellectual property for which infringement is claimed 
further  if our customers are required to obtain a license on other than commercially reasonable terms  our business could be jeopardized 
we have indemnification obligations related to our intellectual property  which may require us to pay damages 
our arrangements with fuji photo usa  iomega  sandisk  sony  toshiba and others require us to indemnify them for any damages they may suffer if a third party claims that we are violating their intellectual property rights 
while  to date  we have not received indemnification claims  there may be future claims 
for example  fuji photo usa has been named as a co defendant in the above referenced complaint filed in the central district federal court of the state of california 
smartdisk has agreed to indemnify fuji photo usa with respect to expenses or damages incurred by fuji photo usa in connection with this matter 
any indemnification claim may require us to pay substantial damages  which could negatively impact our financial condition 
we may have particular difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights overseas 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in some foreign countries 
because many of our products are sold and a portion of our business is conducted overseas  primarily japan and europe  our exposure to intellectual property risks may be higher 
because most of our sales are to a relatively small number of customers the loss of any of our key customers would seriously harm our business 
our business will be seriously harmed if we lose any of our significant customers  particularly apple  fujifilm  ingram micro  olympus or sony  or suffer a substantial reduction in or cancellation of orders from these customers 
our current distribution strategy results  and will continue to result  in sales to only a limited number of customers 
some of our products are sold as stand alone products by oems and  to a lesser extent  are bundled together and sold with systems manufactured by third party oems 
during  ingram micro  sony and apple accounted for approximately  and of our revenues and our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately of our revenues 
furthermore  we expect to continue to depend on sales of our products to relatively few customers  which will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues  for the foreseeable future 
since we sell our products to a limited number of large customers  we expect that those customers may pressure us to make price concessions  which would reduce our future gross margins 
our reliance on sales to a limited number of large customers may expose us to pressure for price concessions 
because of this reliance and because of our dependence on oems as our primary distribution channel  we expect that our oem customers may seek price concessions from us  which would reduce our average selling prices and our gross margins 
since we do not manufacture our own products  we may be unable to reduce our manufacturing costs in response to declining average per unit selling prices 
our customers could stop purchasing our products at any time because we do not have long term purchase contracts with them 
no oem or other customer is contractually obligated to purchase products from us 
as a result  our customers are free to cancel their orders or stop ordering our products at any time 
in addition  even if we are able to demonstrate that our products are superior  oems may still choose not to bundle our products with theirs or market and distribute our products on a stand alone basis 
oems may also change their business strategies and manufacturing practices  which could cause them to purchase fewer of our products  find other sources for products we currently manufacture or manufacture these products internally 
our ability to sell our products will be limited if the oems products do not achieve market acceptance or if the oems do not adequately promote our products 
we depend upon our oem customers to market certain of our products and we do not have significant experience and resources devoted to independent marketing efforts 
failure of the oems products to achieve market acceptance  the failure of the oems to bundle our products with theirs  or any other event causing a decline in our sales to the oems could seriously harm our business 
even if consumers buy oems products  their ultimate decision to buy our products depends on oem packaging  distribution and sales efforts  which may not be sufficient to maintain or increase sales of our products 
if we cannot achieve or maintain a sufficient consumer acceptance rate of our products concurrent with their purchases of oem products  our future sales to oem customers will be adversely affected 
a new or competing data transfer solution that achieves significant market share or receives significant support from flash memory card or digital appliance manufacturers would jeopardize our business 
our products currently compete with a number of cable and non cable interfaces between personal computers and digital appliances  including ports  pcmcia slots and infrared interfaces  all of which are pc peripheral interfaces 
it is possible that one of these competing data transfer solutions  or another existing or new technology  could achieve a significant market presence or become supported by a number of significant flash memory card or digital appliance manufacturers 
regardless of the relative benefits of our products  if a competing product gains significant market share or significant support of flash card manufacturers  this product would likely emerge as the industry standard and thereby achieve a dominant market position that would jeopardize our survival 
we expect to continue outsourcing key operational functions and our ability to do so will be impaired if we are unable to maintain our strategic relationships 
we have formed strategic relationships with a number of significant industry participants  including apple  fujifilm  hitachi  iomega  olympus  rohm  sandisk  sony  toshiba and yamaichi 
we depend upon these corporations to provide technical assistance and perform key manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other functions 
for example  yamaichi is currently one of two manufacturers of our flashpath products  toshiba and apple provide technological assistance in the development of our products  and olympus and fujifilm market our products 
we expect that these and similar types of relationships will be critical to our growth because our business model calls for the continued outsourcing of many key operational functions and we do not currently have the resources to perform these functions ourselves 
we must overcome geographic and cultural differences in order to maintain our strategic relationships 
there are inherent difficulties in developing and maintaining relationships with foreign entities 
language and cultural differences often impair relationships  and geographical distance  at times  is also an impediment 
if any of our current relationships is impaired  or if we are unable to develop additional strategic relationships in the future  our product development costs would significantly increase and our business would be materially and adversely affected 
a portion of our sales and expenses are geographically concentrated in japan  and  therefore  we could suffer from exchange rate fluctuations and economic and political difficulties 
approximately of our revenues for were attributable to sales to japanese customers  and we expect that sales to japanese customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
all of our japanese sales  as well as the related expenses  are denominated in japanese yen 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the yen and the us dollar  particularly with respect to japanese transactions denominated in a currency other than the yen  could adversely impact our financial results 
some transactions and accounts of our japanese and european subsidiary are us dollar denominated 
since the foreign subsidiaries accounting records are kept in local currency  those us dollar denominated transactions are accounted for using the local currency at the time of the transaction 
us dollar denominated accounts are remeasured at the end of the accounting period 
this remeasurement results in adjustments to income 
in addition  the balance sheet accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to the us dollar for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the japanese yen and the british pound may deteriorate against the dollar  which would impair the value of stockholders investment in us 
fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen and the british pound against the dollar have occurred in  resulting in a foreign currency gain of approximately  and a foreign currency translation adjustment to reduce equity for approximately  further  we do not currently hedge against foreign currency exposure 
in the future  we could be required to denominate our product sales in other currencies  which would make the management of currency fluctuations more difficult and expose us to greater currency risks 
we depend on a limited number of contract and offshore manufacturers  and it may be difficult to find replacement manufacturers if our existing relationships are impaired 
we contract with offshore manufacturers to produce some of our products and our dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers exposes us to a variety of risks  including shortages of manufacturing capacity  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  production yield and costs 
for example  yamaichi and mitsumi are the sole manufacturers of our flashpath products 
we do not have contracts with yamaichi or mitsumi 
if yamaichi or mitsumi terminates production  or cannot meet our production requirements  we may have to rely on other contract manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new contract manufacturers 
the lead time required to qualify a new manufacturer could range from approximately three to six months 
despite efforts to do so  we may not be able to identify or qualify new contract manufacturers in a timely manner and these new manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements 
any significant delay in our ability to obtain adequate quantities of our products from our current or alternative contract manufacturers would cause our sales to decline 
toshiba introduced us to one of our manufacturers and we may not be able to retain the services of the manufacturer if our relationship with toshiba is impaired 
yamaichi  one of the manufacturers of our flashpath products  was introduced to us by toshiba  which is one of our major stockholders 
if our relationship with toshiba is impaired  we may not be able to retain the services of yamaichi in manufacturing our products 
our dependence on foreign manufacturing and international sales exposes us to difficulties often not encountered by exclusively domestic companies 
many of our products are manufactured overseas and a significant portion of our revenues is derived from overseas sales 
approximately of our revenues during were derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily in japan 
our dependence on foreign manufacturers and international sales poses a number of risks  including bullet difficulties in monitoring production  bullet transportation delays and interruptions  bullet unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  bullet currency exchange risks  bullet tariffs and other trade barriers  including import and export restrictions  bullet difficulties in staffing and managing disparate branch operations  bullet political or economic instability  bullet compliance with foreign laws  bullet difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in foreign countries  bullet exchange controls  and bullet potential adverse tax consequences  including with respect to repatriation of earnings 
we intend to continue manufacturing our products overseas and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
therefore  we expect to be subject to the risks outlined above for the foreseeable future 
we have a limited number of suppliers of key components and our ability to produce finished products will be impaired if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of some components 
rohm is our sole provider of application specific integrated circuits  or asics  for our flashpath products 
in our flashpath products  the specific function of these integrated circuits is the conversion of digital and analog data 
in addition  iomega is a sole source supplier of zip drives  and lsi logic is our primary supplier of asics for our firewire products 
our dependence on a limited number of suppliers and our lack of long term supply contracts exposes us to several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components  price increases  late deliveries and poor component quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of components could delay shipments of our products 
the lead time required for orders of some of our components is as much as six months 
in addition  the lead time required to qualify new suppliers for our components is as much as months 
if we are unable to accurately predict our component needs  or if our component supply is disrupted  we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our products 
this may damage our relationships with current and prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and increased competition could harm sales of our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  purchasing and other resources than we do 
as a result  some of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or standards or to changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  and may be able to deliver competitive products at a lower end user price 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
therefore  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our business may suffer if we are unable to manage our growth 
failure to effectively manage our growth could impair our ability to execute our business strategy 
our business has grown substantially in recent periods  with revenues increasing from approximately million in to approximately million in the growth of our business has placed a strain on our management  operations and financial systems 
in addition  the number of employees has increased from at january  to as of december  we expect to continue to increase the number of employees as our business grows  and may expand operations to locations other than those in which we currently operate 
continued growth is likely to place a greater burden on our operating and financial systems as well as our senior management and other personnel 
existing and new members of management may not be able to improve existing systems and controls or implement new systems and controls in response to anticipated growth 
management of our operations in diverse locations may also complicate the task of managing our growth 
we may not be able to integrate the business of companies we acquire and therefore these acquisitions may not provide additional value to our stockholders 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies 
we acquired vst in march and impleo in april we may not realize the desired benefits of these transactions or of future transactions 
in order to successfully integrate acquired companies we must  among other things bullet continue to attract and retain key management and other personnel  bullet integrate the acquired products from both an engineering and sales and marketing prospective  bullet establish a common corporate culture  and bullet integrate geographically distant facilities  systems and employees 
if our management s attention to day to day operations is diverted to integrating acquired companies or if problems in the integration process arise  our business could be adversely affected and we could be required to use a significant portion of our available cash 
if an acquisition is made utilizing our securities  a significant dilution to our stockholders and significant acquisition related charges to earnings could occur 
our acquisitions of vst and impleo were dilutive and we expect that our earnings per share will remain negative for the foreseeable future as a result of these acquisitions 
we may incur additional charges in the future resulting from redundancies in product lines  customer lists and sales channels associated with these acquisitions 
acquisitions may also cause us to incur or assume additional liabilities or indebtedness  including liabilities that are unknown or not fully known to us at the time of the acquisition  which could have an adverse effect on us 
furthermore  we cannot assure that any products we acquire in connection with any acquisition will gain acceptance in our markets 
some of our products may be returned to us by our oem customers if projected consumer demand does not materialize  which would lead to a reduction in our revenues 
lack of consumer demand for our products may result in efforts by oems to return products to us 
while we are contractually obligated to accept returned products from our oems only on a limited basis  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with them 
product returns would reduce our revenues 
while we have experienced very limited product returns to date  returns may increase in the future 
we could be held liable for product defects  which could require us to pay substantial damages and harm our reputation with our customers 
complex products such as ours can contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could hinder market acceptance of our products  which could damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
errors  defects or bugs could also cause interruption  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers  and could subject us to warranty claims from our customers 
we would have to expend significant capital and resources to remedy these problems 
errors  defects or bugs could be discovered in our new products after we begin commercial production of them  despite testing by us and our suppliers and customers 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business  and these officers and personnel may not remain with us in the future 
we depend upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales and product development personnel 
the loss of any of those personnel could seriously harm us 
although some of our officers are subject to employment agreements  we cannot be sure that we will retain their services 
in addition  we have not obtained key person life insurance on any of our executive officers or key employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our invested funds while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including us government and government agency notes  corporate bonds and notes and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our investment portfolio includes marketable securities with contractual maturities of less than one year and active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
aggregate average fair value interest rate included in cash and cash equivalents months  included in short term investments months  we do not currently hold or issue derivative securities  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct operations and sell products in several different countries 
some balance sheet accounts of our us  japanese and european operations are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency and are remeasured to the respective local currency at the end of the accounting period 
this remeasurement results in an adjustment to income 
additionally  the balance sheet accounts of our japanese and european operations are translated to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders equity 
the value of the respective local currency may strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  which would impact the value of stockholders investment in our common stock 
fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen and the british pound against the us dollar have occurred in  resulting in a realized foreign currency gain of approximately  in addition  during such fluctuations resulted in an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of approximately  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income and shown in the equity section of our balance sheet 
while most of the transactions of our us  japanese and european operations are denominated in the respective local currency  some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
our operating results may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the japanese yen and the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
most of the revenue and expense items of our japanese and european subsidiaries are denominated in the respective local currency 
in both regions  we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
for example  a decrease in the japanese yen to us dollar rate of percent would have resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately million and a decrease in the net loss before income tax of approximately million 
a percent adverse change in the british pound against the us dollar would not have a material effect on net loss before income taxes 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure  however  we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we have not incurred significant realized losses on exchange transactions 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses 
intangible asset risk 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although at december  we believe our intangible assets are recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their consequent effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
