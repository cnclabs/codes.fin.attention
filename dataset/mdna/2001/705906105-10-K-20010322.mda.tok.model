pegasus commission processing provides a comprehensive and technologically advanced hotel commission processing service by collecting and consolidating check out information and travel agency commissions on behalf of more than  properties representing a significant number of major hotel brands 
each month pegasus commission processing consolidates and distributes millions of dollars in commission payments to its participating travel agencies  which number over  in more than countries 
this value added commission consolidation and reporting service facilitates more efficient and effective operation for both hotel and travel agency participants by providing a single  monthly commission payment to member travel agencies from participating hotels 
pegasus commission processing processed approximately million in hotel commission payments in pegasus commission processing revenues consist of both travel agency and hotel fees 
travel agency fees are based on a percentage of the value of hotel commissions processed by pegasus on behalf of participating travel agencies 
revenues from travel agency fees can vary substantially from period to period based on the types of hotels at which reservations are made and fluctuations in overall room rates 
in addition  participating hotels generally pay fees based on the number of commissionable transactions that pegasus processes for the respective hotel 
our commission processing revenues represented approximately percent of revenues in travelweb

revenues for this service are derived from the difference in the exchange rate that the traveler actually paid and the exchange rate when the guest stay occurs 
technology the technology company includes crs  electronic distribution  pms and business intelligence services 
hotel companies are placing an increasing emphasis on the use of technology as a means of both increasing revenues as well as reducing costs 
increasingly  hotel companies are realizing that internally developing and operating their own technology solutions may not always be the most cost effective approach  particularly as this relates to crs and pms functions 
these systems tend to be expensive to build  operate and update 
as a result  many hotel companies have chosen to utilize the services of a third party to provide crs and pms capability

rez  inc 
acquisition on april   pegasus completed the acquisition of rez  inc rez now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of pegasus 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  rez s results of operations subsequent to the acquisition date are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the million purchase price includes approximately million in acquisition costs and was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair value at the acquisition date 
the approximate fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  excluding a write off of purchased in process research and development  is summarized below in thousands estimated fair value of rez net tangible assets purchased deferred tax liability associated with the intangibles acquired  customer relationships  software  workforce in place  non compete agreement  goodwill  the allocation of the purchase price to intangibles was based upon an independent  third party appraisal and management s estimates 
the intangible assets and goodwill have estimated useful lives and estimated annual amortization as follows in thousands calculated estimated annual amount useful life amortization customer relationships  years  software  years  workforce in place  years  non compete agreement  years goodwill  years  the value assigned to purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
these projects totaled million and include a customer reporting system and corporate direct  a program for discounted corporate room rates on the internet 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
net cash flows 
the net cash flows from the identified projects are based on our estimates of revenues  cost of services  research and development costs  marketing and promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses associated with each project 
the research and development costs included in the model reflect costs to sustain projects  but exclude costs to bring in process projects to technological feasibility 
discount rate 
the net cash flows were discounted back to their present value using a percent discount rate 
this discount rate is higher than the industry weighted average cost of capital due to inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances which could potentially impact the estimates described above 
percentage of completion 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined using costs incurred to date on each project as compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring each project to technological feasibility 
the percentage of completion applied to the customer reporting and corporate direct projects were percent and percent  respectively 
both projects were completed during although the scope of the customer reporting project was reduced 
management does not expect this change in scope to have a material impact on the company s revenues  operating results and financial condition

com and business intelligence services 
we will begin using this new organizational structure for segment reporting in the first quarter of we operate golden tulip under a brand license agreement with nh hotels of madrid  or nh 
pursuant to the agreement  we are required to have at least participating hotels by the end of we do not expect to meet that requirement 
while we continue to discuss alternatives with nh  we expect to return the licenses and the brand business back to nh at the end of because of significant net operating losses  management decided in the fourth quarter of not to seek new business intelligence customers and only to service existing contracts 
at that time  the company determined that the net book values of goodwill and certain other assets were impaired  and recorded asset impairment costs of million in the fourth quarter of at december   pegasus was in negotiations to sell business intelligence

accordingly  rez s results of operations subsequent to the acquisition are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
weakness of the euro 
since the rez acquisition  pegasus derives a substantial portion of its revenue from customers located outside the united states  particularly in europe

in addition  revenue earned on the spread between the currency in which the hotel commission is earned and the currency paid to the travel agency increased 
incremental reconciliation and tracking services revenue also contributed to the increase in commission processing revenues

pegasus expects this trend to continue

years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues for increased to million from million in  an increase of percent 
the increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher transaction levels for electronic distribution and commission processing as well as the acquisition of driving revenue in august  which provided the majority of business intelligence revenues for electronic distribution revenues increased million  or percent  in compared to the increase resulted primarily from a percent increase in the number of hotel reservations made through the gds and internet based distribution services 
although gds revenue per transaction decreased in compared to  total transaction revenue per transaction increased percent due to a higher percentage of internet based transactions  which generate more revenue per transaction 
a million increase in non transaction related revenues also contributed to the increase in total electronic distribution revenues 
non transaction related revenues include implementation fees  subscription fees and advertising revenues 
commission processing revenues increased percent in compared to as a result of a percent increase in the number of hotel commission transactions processed 
the increase in the number of transactions was due in part to an increase in the number of hotel properties and travel agencies participating in pegasus commission processing

business intelligence had net pretax losses of approximately million and million for and  respectively

pegasus expects this segment to continue to have losses in the foreseeable future 
cost of services 
cost of services increased by million  or percent  to million in from million in cost of services increased due to additional staffing primarily related to new business intelligence services 
the number of technology personnel increased percent at december  compared to december  in addition  pegasus incurred approximately  in for enhancing its infrastructure 
these enhancements included upgrades to e mail and wide area networks 
this increase was partially offset by a  decrease in costs associated with pegasus commission processing during the first half of as some functions that were previously outsourced were brought in house at a lower cost during the third quarter of research and development 
research and development expenses decreased  or percent  to million in from million in in  research and development expenses were primarily related to the development of business intelligence services while expenses included a major commission processing project  which was completed in the third quarter this commission processing project was comprised of internally developed software and procedures to sort and consolidate commissions by travel agency 
prior to the completion of this project  this process was outsourced 
write off of purchased in process research and development 
during  pegasus incurred a charge of million to write off purchased in process research and development related to the acquisition of driving revenue in august based on a third party valuation  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development projects that at the time of the acquisition had not reached technological feasibility and had no probable alternative future use 
in determining the valuation pegasus identified eight projects as in process research and development 
of these eight  three were associated with a market planner product  three with a database product and two were internet enabled query tools 
each project was estimated to have a specific revenue stream that was assumed to generate a percent cash flow margin over a ten year period 
each project was determined to be at a certain stage of completion ranging from to percent  and these factors were applied to the present value of each project s future cash flows using a percent discount rate 
the resulting million valuation was charged to operations in subsequent to the driving revenue acquisition  pegasus re evaluated the role of the market planner product 
since the market planner is a stand alone software sale that does not fit with pegasus business strategy  pegasus has elected to stop selling it and terminated work on the development of the three market planner projects 
pegasus has elected to focus its efforts on projects that better fit with its strategy of producing recurring revenues form customers 
pegasus management believes that the decision not to develop the acquired technology will have no impact on future results of operations or financial position 
pegasus has continued developing new database tools and has completed the major elements of the new database project as of january the cost to complete the project was approximately million  which is roughly consistent with pegasus earlier projections 
the new database capability is being rolled out to pegasus customer base 
pegasus is continuing to work on internet enabled query tools and expects that these will be available in future years as estimated in the original cash flows used in determining the purchased in process research and development charge in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and office costs including telephone  travel and supplies associated with increased headcount 
personnel and office costs increased approximately  in compared to in addition  accounting and legal expenses increased approximately  as a result of additional reporting and consulting services necessary due to increasingly complex tax  legal and reporting issues associated with pegasus growth over the past year 
marketing and promotion expenses 
marketing and promotion expenses increased million  or percent  to million in from million in marketing and promotion expenses increased primarily due to a percent increase in the number marketing and sales personnel and the related recruiting and relocation costs 
the additional sales and marketing personnel were needed to promote commission processing services  internet based distribution services and new business intelligence services 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased  or percent  to million in from million in amortization expense decreased  in as compared to because goodwill and capitalized software associated with the purchase accounting transaction that formed pegasus was fully amortized as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of the related amortization expense was  in the decrease in amortization expense was somewhat offset of by an additional  for the amortization of goodwill and software related to the acquisition of driving revenue in august depreciation expense increased  in as compared to due to additions of property and equipment 
the increase in depreciation expense was partially offset because the former computing platform for pegasus electronic distribution was fully depreciated and replaced in with less expensive equipment resulting in lower depreciation expense 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or percent  to million in from million in interest income increased as pegasus had additional cash available for short term investment as of result of the secondary public offering of common stock in may the increase was partially offset by a decline in the prevailing interest rate level for short term investments during the first three quarters of combined with a shift in the investment portfolio to include tax exempt securities with lower pre tax yields 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or percent  to  in from  in interest expense reflects payments made under capital equipment leases  and the decrease is due to the expiration of some leases

however  there can be no assurance that any financing alternatives sought by pegasus will be available or will be on terms that are attractive to pegasus 
further  any debt financing may involve restrictive covenants  and any equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders 
inflation pegasus does not believe that inflation has materially impacted results of operations during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on its results of operations to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers

in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which summarizes some of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the staff is providing this guidance due  in part  to the large number of revenue recognition issues that registrants encounter 
the application of sab to revenue recognition for one time set up fees had an immaterial effect on pegasus consolidated statement of operations 
pegasus applied sab on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december  in march  the fasb issued interpretation no
