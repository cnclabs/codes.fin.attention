overview we design and market broadband communications equipment that enables telephone companies and other communications service providers to cost effectively deliver a full suite of voice  data and video services over the existing copper wire telephone infrastructure 
we commenced operations in july and recorded our first sale in september from january until november  we operated through next level communications lp  which was formed as the result of the transfer of all of the net assets  management and workforce of a wholly owned subsidiary of general instrument 
in november  the business and assets of that partnership were merged into next level communications  inc as part of our recapitalization 
in january  general instrument was acquired by motorola  inc  making us an indirect subsidiary of motorola 
we generate our revenue primarily from sales of our equipment 
one customer has accounted for a large part of our revenues to date  and we expect this concentration to continue in the future 
qwest  formerly u s west  accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
as a result of the merger between u s west and qwest  qwest has slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
sales to qwest in the future are dependent upon their decision regarding the deployment of our product 
our agreements with our largest customers are cancelable by these customers on short notice and without penalty  and do not obligate the customers to purchase any products 
in addition  our significant customer agreements generally contain fixed price provisions 
as a result  our ability to generate a profit on these contracts depends upon our ability to produce and market our products at costs lower than these fixed prices 
the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict because of the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products 
customers view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers typically undertake significant evaluation  testing and trial of our products before deploying them 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from six months to more than a year 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order  if at all  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management efforts 
revenues 
our revenues consist primarily of sales of equipment and sales of data communications software 
we recognize revenue from equipment sales when contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we accrue a provision for estimated sales returns and other allowances as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
software revenue consists of sales to original equipment manufacturers that supply communications software and hardware to distributors 
software license revenue is recognized when a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
the portion of revenues from new software license agreements that relate to our obligation to provide customer support are deferred based on the price charged for customer support when it is sold separately  and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenue from the renewal of customer support contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
cost of revenues 
cost of equipment revenue includes direct material and labor  depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment  warranty expenses  license fees and manufacturing and service overhead 
research and development 
research and development expense consists principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees  prototype component expenses and development contracts related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in direct marketing and field service support functions  executive  accounting and administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
results of operations comparison of to revenues 
total revenues in increased to million from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in equipment sales 
total revenues for the period included million of equipment sales  compared to million in qwest accounted for million of equipment revenue in as compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to qwest s increased deployment in the first three quarters of as a result of the merger between u s west and qwest  qwest slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
sales to qwest in the future are dependent upon their decision regarding the deployment of our product 
we expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of equipment to qwest and local  foreign and independent telephone companies for the foreseeable future 
the growth in equipment revenue in future quarters will depend upon whether and how quickly our existing customers roll out broadband services in their coverage areas and whether and how quickly we obtain new customers 
software revenue remained comparable in both years increasing in to million from million in we expect demand for our software to remain relatively flat in the near term because the market for these products is mature 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in included in current year cost of sales is a million charge to inventory that was primarily related to a lower of cost or market adjustment to certain residential gateway products due to decreases in our sales price per unit and other obsolescence provisions 
our gross margin percentage including the inventory charge increased to in from in excluding the inventory charge  our gross margin percentage increased to in from in the increase in our gross margin percentage was primarily the result of higher unit volumes  leading to greater efficiencies  including lower fixed costs per unit 
we expect gross margin improvements in the latter part of as we increase sales of our higher margin products  and continue implementing cost reductions 
in the future  cost of sales as a percent of sales may fluctuate due to a wide variety of factors  including the customer mix  the product mix  the timing and size of orders which are received  the availability of adequate supplies of key components and assemblies  our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  the timing of new product introductions or announcements by us or our competitors  price competition and unit volume 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development personnel 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product development and cost reduction objectives and  as a result  expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars 
we expense all of our research and development costs as incurred 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in the scale of our operations including additional personnel in our operations  administration  sales and marketing organizations  promotional expenses and other administrative expenses 
we have generated higher sales expenses by hiring new sales representatives in order to increase the number and size of our customer accounts 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as required to support future revenue growth 
non cash compensation charge 
substantially all of our employees had been granted contingently exercisable stock options that became options to purchase our common stock upon our recapitalization in in addition  tandem stock options were granted in january to some of our employees 
as a result  non cash compensation expense was recognized upon the completion of our initial public offering based on the difference between the exercise price of these options and the initial public offering price of our common stock 
the non cash compensation expense related to these option grants was million in and million in interest income expense  net 
interest income  net in was million  and represents interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering 
in  interest expense  net was million  and related to interest on a million note and accrued interest thereon payable to general instrument that general instrument contributed to us in exchange for shares of our common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering 
comparison of to revenues 
revenues in increased to from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in equipment sales 
total revenues for included million of equipment sales  compared to million for qwest accounted for equipment revenue in as compared to in bell atlantic accounted for million of equipment revenue in as compared to million in sales to bell atlantic decreased in due to the bell atlantic merger with nynex and the new company s shift in focus from network rehabilitation to the entry into the long distance market 
software revenue in decreased to million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a shift in demand from to cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in cost of revenues in included a million inventory charge to establish reserves primarily for obsolescence 
our gross margin percentage increased to in from in the increase in our gross margin percentage was primarily the result of higher unit volumes  leading to greater efficiencies  including lower fixed costs per unit 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development personnel 
included in research and development expenses in were expenses related to spending on third party testing  development of the residential gateway product  and the completion of our products for voice applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in approximately million of compensation expense relating to the telenetworks acquisition is included in the amount for there was no telenetworks compensation expense during the decrease in compensation expense was offset by an increase in other selling  general and administrative expenses due to the increase in scale of our operations including additional personnel in the sales and marketing organizations  promotional expenses and other administrative expenses 
non cash compensation charge 
substantially all of our employees had been granted contingently exercisable stock options that became options to purchase our common stock upon our recapitalization in november in addition  tandem stock options were granted in january to some of our employees 
as a result  non cash compensation expense was recognized upon the completion of our initial public offering based on the difference between the exercise price of the options and the initial public offering price of our common stock 
the non cash compensation expense related to these option grants was million in litigation 
litigation expenses of million for related to the settlement cost of litigation with broad band technologies 
for a detailed discussion of this litigation matter  see legal proceedings 
litigation expenses in were not significant and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was million in remaining relatively unchanged from a net expense of million in the net interest expense in these periods was primarily attributable to interest on a million note and accrued interest thereon payable to general instrument that general instrument contributed to us in exchange for shares of our common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering 
interest income was million in both and and was attributable to interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily by our initial public offering of our stock and through cash contributions and borrowings from general instrument 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in in each case  the use of cash in operating activities was primarily due to our net losses 
the increase in cash used in was primarily attributable to increases in inventories and receivable balances  partially offset by an increase in liabilities 
in  net losses were partially offset by million in non cash compensation charges 
net cash used in investing activities of million in  million in and million in was primarily attributable to capital expenditures to support our engineering and testing activities 
our capital expenditures increased in due to the fact that we completed a significant portion of our build out in that year 
in  net cash used in investing activities also included investments in expanse networks  inc  outreach communications llc  and virtual access totaling approximately million  offset by the sale of million in marketable securities 
net cash used in also included purchases of million of marketable securities with the proceeds from our initial public offering 
as we increase the scope of our operations  we expect that our capital expenditures will increase 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in included million net proceeds from our initial public offering  million contributed by general instrument and borrowings of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of a million loan from general instrument  a million capital contribution from general instrument and a million capital contribution from the general partner 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
we have commitments with suppliers to purchase a total of approximately million of components in in december  we entered into a revolving bank line of credit under which we have the ability to borrow up to the lesser of million or the value of pledged collateral 
at december   the balance outstanding was million and the line was secured by million of marketable securities 
we anticipate that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may use cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
our long term operating and capital lease obliga tions are generally less than million per year 
other than capital lease commitments  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
as we increase the scope of our operations  we expect that our capital expenditures will increase 
we believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  it may still be necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing either during or after the next months if we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to meet our capital expenditure and working capital needs 
in the event additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms  or at all 
recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  is effective for us beginning january  sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be measured at fair value and recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities 
management has determined that the initial adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flow for our entire history  we expect to incur future losses and negative cash flow  and we may never achieve profitability we incurred net losses of million in  million in  and million in our ability to achieve profitability on a continuing basis will depend on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing and broad commercial distribution of our broadband equipment products 
we expect to continue to incur significant product development  sales and marketing  and administrative expenses 
in addition  we depend in part on cost reductions to improve gross profit margins because the fixed price nature of most of our long term customer agreements prevents us from increasing prices 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues and improve gross profit margins to achieve and maintain profitability 
we may not be successful in reducing our costs or in selling our products in sufficient volumes to realize cost benefits from our manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we can achieve sufficient revenues or gross profit margin improvements to generate profitability 
our limited operating history makes it difficult for you to evaluate our business and prospects 
we recorded our first sale in september as a result  we have only a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects 
you should consider our prospects in light of the heightened risks and unexpected expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development 
these risks  expenses and difficulties  which are described further below  apply particularly to us because the market for equipment for delivering voice  data and video services is new and rapidly evolving 
due to our limited operating history  it will be difficult for you to evaluate whether we will successfully address these risks 
we expect our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate  and these fluctuations may make our stock price volatile 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues or operating results may cause volatility in the price of our stock 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may cause the price of our stock to fall 
factors likely to cause variations in our quarterly revenues and operating results include delays or cancellations of any orders by qwest  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in  or by any other customer accounting for a significant portion of our revenues  variations in the timing  mix and size of orders and shipments of our products throughout a quarter or year  new product introductions by us or by our competitors  the timing of upgrades of telephone companies infrastructure  variations in capital spending budgets of telephone companies  and increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration 
the amount and timing of our operating expenses generally will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the level of actual and anticipated business activity 
because most of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term  we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if our revenues are lower than we had projected and our results of operations could be harmed 
our customer base of telephone companies is extremely concentrated and the loss of or reduction in business from even one of our customers  particularly qwest  could cause our sales to fall significantly 
a small number of customers have accounted for a large part of our revenues to date 
we expect this concentration to continue in the future 
if we lose one of our significant customers  our revenues could be significantly reduced 
qwest accounted for  and of total revenues in  and our agreements with our customers are cancelable by these customers on short notice  without penalty  do not obligate the customers to purchase any products and are not exclusive 
accordingly  we may lose revenues from our significant customers at any time  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
as a result of the merger between u s west and qwest  qwest slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
sales to qwest in the future are dependent upon their decision regarding the deployment of our product 
a significant reduction in purchases of our equipment by qwest could have a material effect on us 
consolidation among telephone companies may reduce our sales 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry may cause delays in the purchase of our products and cause a reexamination of strategic and purchasing decisions by our customers 
in addition  we may lose relationships with key personnel within a customer s organization due to budget cuts  layoffs  or other disruptions following a consolidation 
for example  our sales to nynex  previously one of our largest clients  have decreased significantly as a result of a shift in focus resulting from its merger with bell atlantic 
in addition  as a result of the merger between us west and qwest  qwest has slowed its purcahses of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
because our sales cycle is lengthy and variable  the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict  and we may incur sales and marketing expenses with no guarantee of a future sale 
customers view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers typically undertake significant evaluation  testing and trial of our products before deployment 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from nine months to more than a year 
before a customer places an order  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management efforts 
in addition  product purchases are frequently subject to unexpected administrative  processing and other delays on the part of our customers 
this is particularly true for customers for whom our products represent a very small percentage of their overall purchasing activities 
as a result  sales forecasted to be made to a specific customer for a particular quarter may not be realized in that quarter  and this could result in lower than expected revenues 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund our business and  as a result  we may not be able to grow and compete effectively 
we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates of revenues or capital requirements change or prove inaccurate 
if we cannot raise these funds  we may not be able to grow our business 
we may need additional capital if we need to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles or if we desire to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
in addition  we expect to review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings or enhance our technical capabilities that could require potentially significant amounts of capital 
funds may not be available at the time or times needed on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to make acquisitions  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures effectively 
a significant market for our products may not develop if telephone companies do not successfully deploy broadband services such as high speed data and video 
telephone companies have just recently begun offering high speed data services  and most telephone companies have not offered video services at all 
unless telephone companies make the strategic decision to enter the market for providing broadband services  a significant market for our products may not develop 
sales of our products largely depend on the increased use and widespread adoption of broadband services and the ability of our customers to market and sell broadband services  including video services  to their customers 
certain critical issues concerning use of broadband services are unresolved and will likely affect their use 
these issues include security  reliability  speed and volume  cost  government regulation and the ability to operate with existing and new equipment 
even if telephone companies decide to deploy broadband services  this deployment may not be successful 
our customers have delayed deployments in the past and may delay deployments in the future 
factors that could cause telephone companies not to deploy  to delay deployment of  or to fail to deploy successfully the services for which our products are designed include the following industry consolidation  regulatory uncertainties and delays affecting telephone companies  varying quality of telephone companies network infrastructure and cost of infrastructure upgrades and maintenance  inexperience of telephone companies in obtaining access to video programming content from third party providers  inexperience of telephone companies in providing broadband services and the lack of sufficient technical expertise and personnel to install products and implement services effectively  uncertain subscriber demand for broadband services  and inability of telephone companies to predict return on their investment in broadband capable infrastructure and equipment 
unless our products are successfully deployed and marketed by telephone companies  we will not be able to achieve our business objectives and increase our revenues 
government regulation of our customers and related uncertainty could cause our customers to delay the purchase of our products 
the telecommunications act requires telephone companies  such as the regional bell operating companies  to offer their competitors cost based access to some elements of their networks  including facilities and equipment used to provide high speed data and video services 
these telephone companies may not wish to make expenditures for infrastructure and equipment required to provide broadband services if they will be forced to allow competitors access to this infrastructure and equipment 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  announced that  except in limited circumstances  it will not require incumbent carriers to offer their competitors access to the facilities and equipment used to provide high speed data services 
nevertheless  other regulatory and judicial proceedings relating to telephone companies obligations to provide elements of their network to competitors are pending 
the fcc also requires incumbent carriers to permit competitive carriers to collocate their equipment with the local switching equipment of the incumbents 
the fcc s collocation rules recently have been vacated in part and continue to be subject to regulatory and judicial proceedings 
the uncertainties caused by these regulatory proceedings may cause these telephone companies to delay purchasing decisions at least until the proceedings and any related judicial appeals are completed 
the outcomes of these regulatory proceedings  as well as other fcc regulation  may cause these telephone companies not to deploy services for which our products are designed or to further delay deployment 
additionally  telephone companies deployment of broadband services may be slowed down or stopped because of the need for telephone companies to obtain permits from city  state or federal authorities to implement infrastructure 
our customers and potential customers will not purchase our products if they do not have the infrastructure necessary to use our products 
the copper wire infrastructures over which telephone companies may deliver voice  data and video services using our products vary in quality and reliability 
as a result  some of these telephone companies may not be able to deliver a full set of voice  data and video services to their customers  despite their intention to do so  and this could harm our sales 
even after installation of our products  we remain highly dependent on telephone companies to continue to maintain their infrastructure so that our products will operate at a consistently high performance level 
infrastructure upgrades and maintenance may be costly  and telephone companies may not have the necessary financial resources 
this may be particularly true for our smaller customers and potential customers such as independent telephone companies and domestic local telephone companies 
if our current and potential customers infrastructure is inadequate  we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues from them 
if competing technologies that offer alternative solutions to our products achieve widespread acceptance  the demand for our products may not develop 
technologies that compete with our products include other telecommunications related wireline technologies  cable based technologies  fixed wireless technologies and satellite technologies 
if these alternative technologies are chosen by our existing and potential customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in particular  cable operators are currently deploying products that will be capable of delivering voice  high speed data and video services over cable  including products from general instrument  our principal stockholder  and motorola  its parent 
our technology may not be able to compete effectively against these technologies on price  performance or reliability 
our customers or potential customers that also offer cable based services may choose to purchase cable based technologies 
cable service providers that offer not only data and video but also telephony over cable systems will give subscribers the alternative of purchasing all communications services from a single communications service provider  allowing the potential for more favorable pricing and a single point of contact for bill payment and customer service 
if these services are implemented successfully over cable connections  they will compete directly with the services offered by telephone companies using our products 
in addition  several telephone companies have commenced the marketing of video services over direct broadcast satellite while continuing to provide voice and data services over their existing copper wire infrastructure 
if any of these services are accepted by consumers  the demand for our products may not develop and our ability to generate revenues will be harmed 
we face intense competition in providing equipment for telecommunications networks from larger and more well established companies  and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
these competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we are able to  which could result in the loss of current customers and impair our ability to attract potential customers 
our significant current competitors include advanced fibre communications  alcatel  cisco systems  efficient networks  ericsson  lucent technologies  nokia  nortel networks  reltec acquired by bae systems  cni division  formerly gec marconi  scientific atlanta  siemens and our largest stockholder  general instrument motorola  as well as emerging companies that are developing new technologies 
some of these competitors have existing relationships with our current and prospective customers 
in addition  we anticipate that other large companies  such as matsushita electric industrial which markets products under the panasonic brand name  microsoft  network computer  philips  sony  stmicroelectronics and toshiba america  will likely introduce products that compete with our n residential gateway product in the future 
our customer base may be attracted by the name and resources of these large  well known companies and may prefer to purchase products from them instead of us 
consolidation of our competitors may cause us to lose customers and negatively affect our sales 
consolidation in the telecommunications equipment industry may strengthen our competitors positions in our market  cause us to lose customers and hurt our sales 
for example  as a result of the merger between us west and qwest  qwest has slowed its purchases of our equipment while it re evaluates its plans regarding the deployment of vdsl across its network 
in addition  alcatel acquired dsc communications  lucent acquired ascend communications and bae systems  cni division  formerly gec marconi  acquired reltec 
acquisitions such as these may strengthen our competitors financial  technical and marketing resources and provide them access to regional bell operating companies and other potential customers 
consolidation may also allow some of our competitors to penetrate new markets that we have targeted  such as domestic local  independent and international telephone companies 
this consolidation may negatively affect our ability to increase revenues 
if we do not respond quickly to changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions by our competitors  our products may become obsolete 
our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with the increasing use of the internet  the growth in remote access by telecommuters  the increasingly diverse distribution sources for high quality digital video  and other industry and technological trends 
we expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
if we fail to timely and cost effectively develop new products that respond to new technologies and customer needs  the demand for our products may fall and we could lose revenues 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and the loss of their services could disrupt our operations and our customer relationships 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement 
many of these employees have a significant number of options to purchase our common stock 
many of these options are currently vested and some of our key employees may leave us once they have exercised their options 
in addition  our engineering and product development teams are critical in developing our products and have developed important relationships with our regional bell operating company customers and their technical staffs 
the loss of any of these key personnel could harm our operations and customer relationships 
competition for qualified personnel in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense  and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining these personnel  our ability to grow our business may be harmed 
competition for qualified personnel in the telecommunications equipment industry  specifically in the rohnert park  california area  is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract qualified personnel could harm the growth of our business 
we are actively searching for research and development engineers and sales and marketing personnel who are in short supply 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
in addition  companies in the telecommunications industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that the competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may receive such notices in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel and such notices may result in material litigation and related disruption to our operations 
our operations and customer relationships may become strained due to rapid expansion 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since inception 
we intend to continue to expand in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities both inside and outside the united states 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources 
our management  personnel  systems  procedures  controls and customer service may be inadequate to support our future operations 
to manage expansion effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures  controls and customer service on a timely basis 
we expect significant strain on our order and fulfillment process and our quality control systems if significant expansion of business activity occurs 
if we are unable to properly manage this growth  our operating results  reputation and customer relationships could be harmed 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may affect our ability to compete  and we could lose customers 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  and on trade secrets and confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
there is no guarantee that these safeguards will protect our intellectual property and other valuable confidential information 
if our methods of protecting our intellectual property in the united states or abroad are not adequate  our competitors may copy our technology or independently develop similar technologies and we could lose customers 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products  which could harm our business 
third party claims regarding intellectual property matters could cause us to stop selling our products  license additional technology or pay monetary damages 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors and customers  have asserted patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
we expect that we will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our market grows and the functionality of products overlaps  and our products may currently infringe on one or more united states or international patents 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with third parties that could arise in the future  we could be required to pay substantial damages  including paying treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  to halt the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
licenses may not be available from any third party that asserts intellectual property claims against us  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
in addition  we indemnify our customers for patent infringement claims  and we may be required to obtain licenses on their behalf  which could subject us to significant additional costs 
we depend on third party manufacturers and any disruption in their manufacture of our products would harm our operating results 
we contract for the manufacture of all of our products and have limited in house manufacturing capabilities 
we rely primarily on two large contract manufacturers sci systems and act manufacturing 
the efficient operation of our business will depend  in large part  on our ability to have these and other companies manufacture our products in a timely manner  cost effectively and in sufficient volumes while maintaining consistent quality 
as our business grows  these manufacturers may not have the capacity to keep up with the increased demand 
any manufacturing disruption could impair our ability to fulfill orders and could cause us to lose customers 
we have no long term contracts with our manufacturers  and we may not be able to deliver our products on time if any of these manufacturers stop making our products 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with any of our contract manufacturers that guarantee product availability  the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes  we will have to identify acceptable alternative manufacturers  which could take in excess of three months 
it is possible that a source may not be available to us when needed or be in a position to satisfy our production requirements at acceptable prices and on a timely basis 
if we cannot find alternative sources for the manufacture of our products  we will not be able to meet existing demand 
as a result  we may lose existing customers  and our ability to gain new customers may be significantly constrained 
our inability to produce sufficient quantities of our products because of our dependence on components from key sole suppliers could result in delays in the delivery of our products and could harm our revenues 
some parts  components and equipment used in our products are obtained from sole sources of supply 
if our sole source suppliers or we fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed resulting in decreased revenues 
additional sole sourced components may be incorporated into our equipment in the future 
we do not have any long term supply contracts to ensure sources of supply 
in addition  our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price  which could harm our operating results
