we have recognized software license revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  which provides specific industry guidance and stipulates that revenue recognized from software arrangements is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of the elements 
under sop  the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
the aicpa subsequently issued its statement of position  which provides certain amendments to its statement of position and is effective for transactions entered into beginning january  the implementation of this latest aicpa pronouncement did not materially impact our revenue recognition practices 
in june  the sec updated staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on revenue recognition and the sec staff s views on the application of accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the adoption sab did not have a material effect on revenue recognition or the company s results of operations 
our revenue consists of software license revenue and related client services revenue 
for the foreseeable future  we expect substantially all of our revenue will be derived from our knowledge enabling software and related services 
we market our software and services on a worldwide basis through our direct sales organization in the united states and europe 
in japan  primus kk  a japanese joint venture in which we hold a minority interest  distributes our products 
the rights granted primus kk expire december   and are subject to meeting certain performance obligations 
our international sales constituted of our revenue  of our revenue and of our revenue 
we believe that international revenue  as a percentage of our total revenue  will continue to fluctuate in the future 
our services revenue consists of consulting  training and maintenance and support fees 
we provide consulting and training services relating to our products on a time and materials basis under installation services agreements with our customers 
we provide maintenance and support services to our customers under renewable one year maintenance and support agreements  which we price as a percentage of our license fees 
we currently recognize license revenue over the core implementation period if implementation services are included in the original license arrangement and are considered to be essential to the functionality of the software 
as a result  even where we have a signed license agreement for the purchase of our software and have shipped the software  license revenue recognition depends on whether we have begun core implementation 
for license agreements under which we have no implementation responsibility  or where implementation is not considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue upon shipping the software 
examples of situations under which we have no implementation responsibility include additional license sales to existing customers or customers who elect to use internal or third party resources to implement the software 
for new customers  we generally enter into services agreements to implement our software 
most of our new customers typically begin implementation within days of signing a license agreement 
once commenced  implementation of our products can typically be completed within days 
although both implementation and deployment can vary significantly by customer 
we can not  however  guarantee that customers will begin implementation or that we will always be able to implement our software within those time periods 
thus  all of our deferred license revenue may not be recognized within the originally expected time period 
to help us execute our long term growth strategy  we have invested heavily in product development and in building our sales  marketing  finance  administrative and professional services organizations 
we have incurred quarterly net losses since inception  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our product development  sales and marketing and client services staff

maintenance and support contract revenue increased million from to and consulting fees increased  over the same period 
the increase in services revenue from to was a result of a million increase in maintenance and support contract revenue and million in consulting revenue 
the increase in both types of services revenue was due primarily to an increase in the number of customers and product license sales  which generally include or lead to contracts to perform professional services and purchases of software maintenance and support service contracts 
services revenue represented  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
services revenue as a percentage of total revenue is declining primarily due to license revenue growing at a faster pace than services revenue 
the decline is primarily due to the shortening of the implementation period for our software 
we expect the proportion of services revenue to total revenue to fluctuate in the future  depending in part on our customers use of third party consulting and implementation services providers 
cost of revenue cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue includes royalties and fees paid to third parties under license arrangements and costs related to media and duplication of our products and manuals 
cost of license revenue was million in both and  and  in the cost of license revenue remained flat from to and increased  or  from to cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue was  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our cost of license revenue will increase in absolute dollars and be relatively flat as a percent of license revenue 
license revenue as a percentage of sales has varied in the past due to increases in the volume of software product sales and the type of royalty agreements in place at the time 
cost of services revenue

the decrease in cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue from and to was primarily due to higher utilization of consulting services personnel and growth of maintenance revenue

sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from to and million  or  from to the increases in each year from to are primarily due to the significant growth in the number of our sales and marketing personnel  increased marketing efforts and an increase in commissions paid as a result of revenue growth 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues for each year from to is reflective of total revenues increasing at a much faster pace than variable sales and marketing expenses 
we believe that a significant sales and marketing effort is essential for us to maintain market position and further increase market acceptance of our products  and we anticipate that we will continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses as an absolute dollar amount will increase in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and contractors fees for software developers  program managers and quality assurance personnel 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased million  or  from to and million  or  from to the increase for each year from to was primarily due to increased staffing of software developers and quality assurance staff both employees and contractors to support development of our new products and enhancements to our existing products  and an increase in compensation levels for development and quality assurance personnel 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were  and for  and  respectively 
we believe that a significant research and development investment is essential for us to maintain our market position  to continue to expand our knowledge enabling software and to develop additional applications 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to invest significantly in product research and development for the foreseeable future 
we expect that research and development expenses as an absolute dollar amount will increase in future periods 
in the development of our new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of our software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
accordingly  software development costs eligible for capitalization were insignificant  and all costs related to internal research and development have been expensed as incurred 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related costs for executive  finance  human resource  administrative and information services personnel and costs associated with being a public company  including  but not limited to  annual and other public reporting costs  directors and officers liability insurance  investor relations programs and professional services fees

the increase in general and administrative expenses in from was primarily the result of our hiring additional executive  finance  and administrative personnel to support the growth of our business during this period as well as an increase in legal and professional fees associated with becoming a public company 
the increase in expense also reflects an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease of general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue for the years through is directly attributable to revenue growing at a much faster pace than general and administrative expenses 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will fluctuate as an absolute dollar amount in future periods

these costs were recorded in connection with the january order merger and the december imparto merger  both of which were accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
other income  net 
other income expense was million  million  and  in  and  respectively 
the variances from period to period are due to fluctuations in the average combined cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
the company expects to continue to yield investment income on its average balance of combined cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments at an average rate comparable to that experienced in income taxes 
we have not recorded income tax benefits related to the net operating losses in  and as a result of the uncertainties regarding the realization of the net operating losses 
income tax expense recorded in and primarily relates to our foreign operations 
the tax benefit recorded in primarily relates to a tax benefit from the separate results of imparto  net of tax expense from our foreign operations 
net operating loss carryforwards at december  for federal and state income tax reporting purposes were million   of which will begin to expire in if not utilized and million is related to deductions for the exercise of non qualified stock options

our quarterly operating results have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  we had primarily financed our operations through the private sale of our equity securities 
to a lesser extent  we have financed our operations through equipment financing and traditional lending arrangements 
in july  we completed our initial public offering and issued  shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of per share 
we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other offering costs 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and available for sale securities of million  representing a decrease of million from cash and investments held as of december  as of december   our working capital was million compared to million at december  our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash outflows from to was due primarily to a decrease in deferred revenue and accounts receivable offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
investing activities provided cash of million in and used cash of million in investing activities provided cash in primarily from the maturity of short term securities 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily for the purchase of short term securities and the purchase of capital equipment to meet our domestic and international expansion requirements 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily for the purchase of short term securities following our initial public offering and the purchase of capital equipment 
financing activities provided cash of million and million in and  respectively 
in  cash provided by financing activities primarily represented the proceeds from issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds from our initial public offering in july  offset in part by payments on our credit facility and capital lease obligations 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience significant growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we 
enter new markets for our products and services 
increase research and development spending 
increase sales and marketing activities 
develop new distribution channels 
improve our operational and financial systems 
broaden our professional services capabilities such operating expenses will consume a material amount of our cash resources  including a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with our existing cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any financing we obtain may dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in the company 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation

clarifies the application of apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  for issues  among others  regarding  a the definition of employees  b defining non compensatory plans  c modifications to previously fixed stock option awards  and d accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
we adopted interpretation no 
in the third quarter of and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and change in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
the company is exposed to the impact of short term changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure primarily relates to the company s investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in high quality corporate and municipal debt instruments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause the company to suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may cause the company s future investment income to fall short of expectations 
our investment portfolio is designated as available for sale  and accordingly is presented at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds with investment policies and procedures that limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
the company has not utilized derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
in  the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were insignificant 
at december   our investment portfolio included approximately million in variable rate investments  all of which are due in fixed rate investments at december  of approximately million had a weighted average interest rate of and are due in we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings in from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would be insignificant 
foreign currency risk 
we develop products in the united states and sell them in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars and translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
the company has a foreign subsidiary whose expenses are incurred in its local currency 
as exchange rates vary  its expenses  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our operating results have not been significantly affected by exchange rate fluctuations in if  in  the us dollar uniformly decreases in strength by relative to the currency of our foreign sales subsidiary  our operating results would likely not be significantly effected
