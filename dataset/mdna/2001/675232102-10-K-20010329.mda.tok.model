although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 
liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million 
additionally  we had million available under committed credit facilities 
we expect operating cash flow to meet our ongoing annual cash requirements  including debt service 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the nine month period ended december   million for the nine month period ended december   million for fiscal and million for fiscal working capital was million at december  compared to million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal capital expenditures for the nine month period ended december  and for the fiscal years ended march  and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures during the nine month period ended december  consisted of expenditures for the conversion of a jackup drilling rig to a mobile offshore production unit  the ocean legend  for initial use offshore western australia under a three year contract  rov additions and construction costs to complete our second multiservice vessel 
capital expenditures in fiscal consisted of construction costs for the second multiservice vessel  additions to our rov fleet and the start of the conversion of the ocean legend 
capital expenditures in fiscal consisted of additions to our rov fleet  construction costs for two multiservice vessels  one of which was placed in service prior to march   a new umbilical plant in brazil and the relocation and upgrading of our umbilical plant in scotland 
commitments for capital expenditures at december  were approximately million for completion of the conversion of the ocean legend 
in april  we approved a plan to purchase up to a maximum of million shares of our common stock  and million shares were purchased under this plan through december   at a total cost of million 
we did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the nine month period ended december  at december   we had long term debt of million and a debt to total capitalization ratio 
in september  we issued million of senior notes to be repaid from through we used the proceeds from the sale of those notes to repay the then outstanding indebtedness under our prior revolving credit facility  which had been incurred in the funding of capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock 
in october  we replaced that revolving credit agreement with a new five year  million revolving credit facility  under which we had million in outstanding borrowings and million available for future borrowings at december  in march  we added a million term loan facility  which is available for drawing until march  and is to be repaid through april at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings and million available for future borrowings under the term loan facility 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenues and expenses in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our permanent investments in and loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
inflation has not had a material effect on us in the past two years and no such effect is expected in the near future

results of operations the table below sets out revenues and profitability for the nine month periods ended december  and and the fiscal years ended march  and nine month period fiscal year ended december  ended march  dollars in thousands unaudited revenues     gross margins     gross margin net income     information on our business segments is shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the table below sets out revenues and profitability for our offshore oil and gas business for the nine month periods ended december  and and the fiscal years ended march  and nine month period fiscal year ended december  ended march  dollars in thousands unaudited offshore oil and gas remotely operated vehicles revenues     gross margin     gross margin operating income     operating income subsea products revenues     gross margin     gross margin operating income    operating income mobile offshore production systems revenues     gross margin     gross margin operating income     operating income other services revenues     gross margin     gross margin operating income loss   operating income loss total offshore oil and gas revenues     gross margin     gross margin operating income     operating income in response to continued increasing demand to support deepwater drilling and identified future construction and production maintenance work  we extended our rov fleet expansion program in by announcing plans for additional new rovs 
these new vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths to  feet and in severe weather conditions 
we have added over rovs to our fleet during the last several years and we plan to add additional vehicles at a rate dependent on market demand 
in the past few years  we have sold or exchanged our foreign diving related assets to concentrate on our other deepwater services and products which have potential for higher margins in april  we sold our north sea diving assets  including a diving support vessel  in fiscal  we sold our west africa diving and related vessel assets  in september  we exchanged our asia  australia and middle east diving assets  including a diving support vessel  for rovs 
in the nine month period ended december   rov revenues were higher than the comparable nine month period of the prior year 
gross margin percentage rose 
these increases were the result of more rovs available for service and an increase in rov utilization from to 
in fiscal  rov revenues declined from fiscal despite our additions to the rov fleet 
utilization declined from to 
both of our major oilfield rov markets  drill support and construction support  were adversely affected as oil and gas companies had lower capital spending levels than those in the prior year 
we anticipate rov utilization and margins to increase in from increased demand as more floating deepwater drilling rigs return to service and from a rise in offshore construction related activities 
subsea products revenues were higher for the nine month period ended december  than those of the comparable period of the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased demand in brazil and the us  as oil and gas companies proceeded with offshore capital projects which had been delayed  and a large steel tube umbilical order in the uk while total gross margin was million higher  margin percentages were relatively flat  as increased profitability in brazil and the us was offset by the large steel tube umbilical order in our uk plant  which earned a low margin 
subsea products revenues were down in fiscal from fiscal  despite the addition of an umbilical plant in brazil and the opening of our upgraded facility in scotland 
umbilical sales and margins were adversely affected by low market demand  as oil and gas companies had lower capital spending levels than those in the prior years  particularly in brazil 
we anticipate improved subsea product results in from increased subsea completion activity 
mobile offshore production systems revenues were down for the nine month period ended december  from the comparable period of the prior year  as production based revenues from the ocean producer were lower due to declining production levels and we had lower project management and engineering service revenues from lower demand 
as of april  the ocean producer unit is on a day to day contract 
we have a letter of intent to contract the unit for a period of seven years to produce from another property in the area 
gross margin percentage was higher due to million of gains on the sales of two out of service semisubmersible rigs 
in addition  we wrote down the carrying value of our out of service tanker  the ocean venture  by million as our assessment of the market it was targeted for  conversion into production service  had changed 
this tanker is not of the size prevalently in demand in the current market and there have been few opportunities to bid the vessel 
therefore  we wrote this vessel down to its estimated market value 
mobile offshore production systems fiscal revenues were lower than fiscal  as we completed a major modification project for the zafiro producer during the year 
in addition  production based revenues from the ocean producer were lower due to declining production levels 
we anticipate improved mobile offshore production systems results in with the commencement of ocean legend operations 
other services revenues were lower in the nine month period ended december  than the comparable period of the prior year 
the lower revenues reflect our dispositions of our west africa diving operations in fiscal and our asia  australia and middle east diving operations in september  along with more competitive conditions resulting from lower capital expenditures by our oilfield customers 
gross margins were lower due to lower vessel utilization and related services in the gulf of mexico 
other services revenues were up in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to a full year of operations from the multiservice vessel ocean intervention 
however  margins reflected very competitive market conditions resulting from reduced oilfield capital spending 
the net operating loss was attributed to two large fixed price jobs in india 
we anticipate improved other services results in from higher demand for our oilfield services in general  including our multiservice vessels 
advanced technologies 
the table below sets out revenues and profitability for this segment for the nine month periods ended december  and and the fiscal years ended march  and nine month period fiscal year ended december  ended march  dollars in thousands unaudited revenues     gross margin     gross margin operating income     operating income advanced technologies revenues were lower in the nine month period ended december  than the comparable period of the prior year as the prior period included a large outfall job in southeast asia  which was performed using resources associated with our other services segment 
these resources were part of those we exchanged in september for rovs 
margins were lower as the december period included provisions totaling million relating to operations of a division we no longer own 
advanced technologies revenues in fiscal were higher than in fiscal due to increased work levels for the navy  the outfall job in southeast asia and more search and recovery work 
margin percentages were relatively unchanged 
we anticipate similar results from advanced technologies in the next year  contingent upon the level of government funding for nasa and us navy programs in which we currently participate or are pursuing 
other 
interest expense increased over the three year period as a result of our increased borrowings to fund capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock 
interest expense is net of capitalized interest of million for the nine month period ended december   million for fiscal and million for fiscal our effective tax rate  determined after consideration of valuation allowances and foreign  state and local taxes  was  and for the nine month period ended december  and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we believe that a significant fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates would not have a material near term effect on our future earnings or cash flows
