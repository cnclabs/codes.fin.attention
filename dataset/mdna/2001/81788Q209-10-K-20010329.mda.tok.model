the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
all financial information is presented in us dollars unless otherwise noted 
as described in part i business information regarding forward looking statements  some of the statements set forth in this section are forward looking statements relating to our future results of operations 
our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements 
for a description of the risks that may cause our future performance to differ adversely from those described below  please read carefully the information set forth under part i business risk factors 
overview we were established in july to conceive  design and distribute internet infrastructure software solutions that enable financial institutions to deliver financial information and services using a broad range of internet enabled devices 
for the period from july to may  we were in a development phase  conducting research and developing our products 
in may  we launched our initial product  for use in connection with financial services  on a trial basis with a limited number of customers of the bank of montreal 
during the trial  these customers were able to access banking and brokerage services and lifestyle content  including news  stock quotes  weather  lottery results and horoscopes  through internet enabled devices  specifically palm pilot connected organizers and mobile phones 
this trial was completed in september during the period from may through december  we filled key management positions in our sales and marketing departments  attracted bank of america  citigroup and sonera corporation as investors  entered into license agreements with bank of america  wells fargo and citigroup  and continued to develop our product 
our headcount has grown to employees as of december  after giving effect to our january acquisition of tantau software inc  we had employees as of january  recent acquisitions yrless 
in march  we acquired internet messaging gateway developer yrless internet corporation of oakville  ontario 
yrless developed the ymg  a scaleable  platform independent carrier grade short messaging service gateway for wireless carriers 
prior to the acquisition  yrless had licensed its technology to network operators bell mobility and telus mobility 
we plan to use this gateway to enhance our ability to quickly connect to carriers 
in this transaction  we paid total cash consideration of approximately million  including acquisition costs of approximately  in addition  we are committed to pay approximately million over three years  commencing march of the million commitment  million is contingent on the former shareholders of yrless remaining as our employees 
this amount vests over three years as services are being performed by these former shareholders 
this amount is required to be paid in our common shares based upon their market value at the time of issuance  unless we agree otherwise with one or more of the former shareholders  or under other limited circumstances 
we intend to settle this obligation in shares 
ezlogin 
in june  we completed our acquisition of ezlogin  a leading provider of internet software infrastructure tools for user directed personalization 
using the technologies that we acquired in this transaction  we introduced liveclips  a comprehensive aggregation tool designed to enable our customers to provide consumers with a consolidated view of their online accounts and other items of personal interest 
liveclips also enables consumers to select other internet content for display on their personalized web pages 
in this transaction  we issued  of our common shares at the closing 
in addition  we assumed the options that were outstanding under ezlogin s stock option plan  and  at the closing  these options were converted into options to purchase  of our common shares 
spyonit 
in september  we completed our acquisition of chicago based spyonit 
spyonit s intelligent alerting infrastructure software monitors the internet for items of interest such as stock prices  product sales or auction bids 
when appropriate content is detected  the spyonit system delivers smart notifications to the user through a variety of internet access devices 
spyonit allows us to broaden the range of alert services that the solutions platform supports  complements our liveclips aggregation tool  and adds an attractive standalone offering to our product portfolio 
in this transaction  the purchase price of approximately million was satisfied by the issuance of  of our common shares and million in cash 
as part of the terms of the purchase  up to  of the total common shares issued are subject to repurchase at a nominal value if the vendors do not remain our employees through september tantau software 
in january  we completed our acquisition of austin based tantau software 
tantau develops and designs software and related services that enable enterprises to conduct high volume  secure  m commerce transactions 
we believe that tantau s infrastructure will complement our solutions applications 
by integrating tantau s platform with our solutions platform and applications  we believe that we will be able to offer enhanced services to our existing and future customers that require a strong enterprise wide solution 
as consideration for the acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  of our common shares and assumed options originally issued by tantau  which  as of the closing date  became exercisable to purchase an additional  of our common shares 
the calculated acquisition price is estimated to be approximately million  including acquisition costs of million 
in addition  we will be recognizing approximately million in deferred stock based compensation relating to the assumption of tantau s stock option plan 
the acquisition will be accounted for by the purchase method 
for additional information regarding our accounting for these acquisitions  please see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenue our primary sources of revenue are revenues generated under our license agreements and services revenue with respect to our solutions platform 
historically  our services revenue has consisted primarily of implementation  customer service and maintenance fees 
in the future  we expect our services revenue to also include amounts derived from revenue sharing arrangements and commissions on m commerce transactions 
we have recently commenced providing hosting services to our customers  revenues from these services are included in our services revenue 
we expect to increase our hosting revenue once customers have commenced signing up subscribers to use services based on our products and the services have begun to operate from our data center 
as our hosting services expand  we believe that the portion of our revenues derived from hosting and maintenance services will increase in future periods 
license fees our two initial license agreements were with bank of montreal and bank of america  and used a fixed fee license model 
under this model  a customer pays us a fixed annual license fee in whole or part upon execution of the license agreement  and or periodically thereafter during the term of the agreement 
the use of this model helped provide the initial cash flow that was necessary to fund our development and start up costs 
our initial fixed fee license contracts contained provisions that required us to deliver to our customers all of the technology that we made generally available to our customers during the term of the agreement 
as such  these fees have been recognized using the subscription accounting method commencing with the delivery of the first product in the contract 
after raising additional capital in august through the issuance of common shares  we had the financial resources to forego this fixed fee license model in favor of a variable fee license model 
our agreements with several of our customers  including citigroup  wells fargo  wachovia and claritybank 
com  utilize this model 
the variable fee license model is based on a per user fee 
we expect that the transition of our revenue model from fixed fee to variable fee will have two significant consequences first  we will no longer receive the primary portion of our license fees as initial payments under our customer agreements  and second  we expect our revenue stream will vary with the number of our customers end users 
we expect that these variable fees will be subject to a minimum quarterly payment  and expect to provide incentive discounts to our customers based on the number of their customers using our platform 
to date  we have not received revenues from the user fees in excess of any minimum payments 
however  over time  we expect these fees to become a significant portion of our revenue once our customers roll out services based upon our platform to a substantial number of consumers 
under the variable fee license model  we recognize revenue when we have executed an agreement with a customer  when delivery and acceptance have occurred  and when the collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
revenue from the minimum payments is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue associated with user fees in excess of any minimum payments will be recognized on a quarterly basis when the amount is determined 
we expect that in our future contracts that use the variable fee license model  the customer will pay us a license fee consisting of an up front payment upon execution of the contract and an ongoing variable fee based on the number of users 
the monthly user fees may be subject to minimum quarterly payments 
we will allocate revenue to the software based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the portion of revenue that will be allocated to the software will be recognized as revenue when delivery and acceptance have occurred and when the collection of any related receivable is deemed probable 
as a result  we anticipate that the initial payments under these contracts will tend to be recognized by revenue either in the quarter in which the contract is executed or shortly thereafter 
revenue from the minimum payments will be recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue associated with user fees in excess of any minimum payments will be recognized on a quarterly basis when the amount is determined 
in fiscal  we entered into a number of reseller agreements 
while each arrangement can be different  the reseller generally pays either a non refundable licensing fee for our software and or a royalty fee based on the related number of users 
we recognize revenue associated with a non refundable license fee upon the execution of the contract when delivery and acceptance have occurred  no significant performance requirements are remaining  and when the collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
additional license fees based on the number of users  are recognized monthly 
implementation and customer service fees revenue from implementation and customer services includes fees for implementation of our product offerings  consulting and training services 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  upon a combination of our own resources and third party consulting organizations to deliver these services to our customers 
customers are charged a fee based on time and expenses 
revenue from implementation and customer service fees is recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance fees we receive revenue from maintaining and servicing our products for customers 
the maintenance fee is typically equal to a specified percentage of the customer s license fee 
if associated with the fixed fee license model  the maintenance revenues received will be deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
when associated with the variable fee license model  any minimum payments will be recognized on a monthly basis 
maintenance revenue in excess of any minimum payments will be recognized on a quarterly basis when the amount is determined 
hosting fees some of our existing customers require us  and we expect that many of our potential customers would require us  to host and manage the server infrastructure and software platform as part of the implementation of our products 
in fiscal  we commenced providing this service to our customers 
we typically charge a customer a one time setup fee plus a per monthly flat fee or a monthly fee based on the number of users 
the set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement 
revenue derived from tantau software we expect to derive additional license and professional services revenue from our purchase of tantau in january tantau s software license revenue is generated principally from the licensing of its products  including the wireless internet platform  directly to enterprises and indirectly through value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
now that we have acquired tantau  we anticipate that some customers will seek to purchase the tantau platform as a stand alone product  while other customers will purchase the integrated solutions tantau product offerings 
tantau uses a per seat model  in which the licensee pays a one time license fee for a fixed number of installed copies in exchange for a license with a perpetual term 
the licensed software is sold in increments as the user expands its use  and we recognize revenue under these contracts when the software is shipped 
tantau licenses its products to end users primarily under perpetual licenses 
tantau s standard perpetual license agreement includes post contract customer support for a specified period of time 
thereafter  post contract customer support can be renewed annually for an additional fee 
tantau uses the post contract customer support renewal rate as evidence of the fair value of this service 
since post contract customer support is the only undelivered element in these arrangements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
the fair value of post contract customer support is recognized over the term of the support obligation and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable  and tantau has no remaining obligations other than the delivery of the support 
tantau enters into arrangements with original equipment manufacturers oems and resellers 
under these arrangements  tantau grants the oem or reseller rights to sell products which incorporate tantau s products for a specified period of time 
tantau s primary obligation to the oem or reseller is to deliver a product master and any bug fixes under warranty provisions in order to maintain the product master in accordance with published specifications 
in some arrangements  tantau receives prepaid  non refundable minimum license fees from the oem or reseller 
because tantau s primary obligations to an oem or reseller are fulfilled upon delivery of the product master  tantau recognizes the prepaid  non refundable minimum license fees as revenue as the fees become due and payable or upon delivery of the product master  whichever is later 
tantau s professional services revenue consists primarily of fees for training  consulting  software maintenance and support 
tantau currently relies  and expects to continue to rely  on a combination of its internal professional services organization and third party consulting firms to provide training and consulting services to its customers 
fees for these services are charged on a time and materials basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance fees are derived under annual maintenance agreements with customers  which enable customers to receive service and support from tantau as well as product updates 
maintenance fees typically are set as a specified percentage of the customer s license fee and paid in advance for the maintenance period 
revenues under maintenance agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
results of operations our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles conform in all material respects with us generally accepted accounting principles  except as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we completed our acquisition of tantau in january as a result  the results described here for our prior fiscal years do not include the results of operations of tantau and its subsidiaries 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our revenue  before the offset of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million in december  product revenue our product revenue  before the offset of stock based compensation  increased to million in compared to million in substantially all of the increase resulted from the delivery of our solutions platform in accordance with the terms in our customer contracts entered into in we expect that our product revenue will increase as we sell our products to new customers and our current customers  including the customers that we added in  begin to deliver services based upon our products to end users 
the mix of our product revenue will change as we benefit from the sales of tantau s software 
service revenue our service revenue increased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
most of the increase resulted from our customers seeking additional services to help them deploy our solutions platform and applications and other products 
in addition  we received revenue for consulting work related to the implementation and customization of our liveclips product  which we have made available as a result of our june acquisition of ezlogin 
as product revenue grows  we expect that services revenue from consulting will increase as our customers seek additional services to help them deploy our applications 
we also anticipate that services revenue will increase as more of our customers subscribe for our hosting service 
stock based compensation related to software development revenue under our subscription agreement with bank of montreal bmo dated april   we granted an option to bmo to subscribe for  common shares for cdn 
million 
this option was only exercisable in the event that bmo extended its technology license agreement for a second year and paid the second year s license fee 
in october  following bmo s extension of the license agreement  bmo exercised the option 
on the date of exercise  the fair value of the  common shares was determined to be cdn 
million  resulting in a stock based compensation charge related to software development revenue of cdn 
million  or us million 
this stock based compensation was attributed to our software development revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the revenue recognized in the first and second years 
stock based compensation related to software development revenue decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease resulted from the fact that the second year of this agreement ended in the first quarter of fiscal this deferred stock based compensation charge has now been fully expensed 
operating expenses cost of net revenue cost of net revenue consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training  implementation  consulting and hosting services  as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services and an allocation of expenses for our facilities and administration 
it also includes software licensing expenses paid for integration of third party software into our products 
cost of net revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  most of the increase was due to salary and consulting costs as we significantly increased our implementation and customer services personnel and third party consulting firms to support our customers deployment of our solutions platform  and as we incurred startup and implementation costs required to establish our hosting infrastructure 
included in cost of net revenues is also a non cash charge of  and  for stock based compensation for and  respectively 
while we expect cost of net revenue to increase in the near future as we expand our customer services and hosting service personnel and establish hosting centers worldwide  we expect that our cost of net revenue as a percentage of revenues will decrease and our gross margin will increase 
we are seeking to utilize the personnel and infrastructure that we have built in and  and the experience we have gained in enabling customers to deploy our products  to reduce the per customer costs that we incur in driving the adoption and implementation of our platform 
in addition  we believe that the acquisition of tantau will help us increase our gross margins  as tantau mainly sells licenses which generally have relatively high margins 
research and development research and development expenses include the compensation of software development teams working on the continuing enhancement of our products as well as our quality assurance and testing activities 
these expenses also include independent contractors and consultants  software licensing expenses  and allocated operating expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase from the prior year was attributed to the expansion of the functionality of our platform and costs associated with integrating ezlogin and spyonit and other acquired technology  as well as the continued development of our liveclips and alerts products and the inclusion of a non cash  stock based compensation charge of million in the twelve months ended december  we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in the future as we continue to expand the functionality of our platform and enhance the technologies that we purchased in connection with our acquisitions of yrless  ezlogin  spyonit and tantau 
we expect that our research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as we begin to leverage the technology that was previously developed and as we further benefit from our previous acquisitions 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include compensation of sales and marketing personnel  public relations and advertising  trade shows  marketing materials and allocated operating expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in compared to million in these costs increased primarily because in fiscal we hired additional sales personnel to manage our relationships with our major customers and to expand our business both in north america and worldwide 
in addition  in  we opened sales offices in tokyo and sydney to establish our presence in the asia pacific region and incurred fees associated with marketing programs designed to build brand awareness 
we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we continue to attract customers worldwide  expand our reach to other market segments and increase our efforts to sell our expanding suite of products 
however  as a result of our acquisition of tantau  which has built a sales and marketing infrastructure in europe  a portion of the amounts that we would have otherwise expended to build our presence in europe may be allocated to other geographic markets or to other corporate purposes 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits for corporate personnel and other general and administrative expenses such as professional fees  facilities  travel and professional consulting costs 
our corporate staff includes several of our executive officers and our business development  financial planning and control  legal  human resources and corporate administration staff 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses reflected our continued investment in increased staffing and related expenses for the enhancement of the international infrastructure necessary to support our growing business 
the remainder of the increase was due to a non cash charge for stock based compensation of million and integration and professional fees related to our acquisitions and corporate development activities 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase marginally due to the growth of our company and the acquisition of tantau 
however  as percentage of revenue  we expect these expenses to decrease as we utilize the infrastructure that we built in depreciation and amortization depreciation expense increased to million in compared to  in the increase reflects the capital spending in computer hardware  office furniture and leasehold improvements at our canadian facilities to support the increase in the number of personnel 
additional software development tools used for research and development and computer hardware purchased for our hosting facilities accounted for the remainder of the increase 
amortization expense increased to million in from nil in the increase was due to the goodwill and acquired intangibles relating to the ezlogin acquisition completed in june and the spyonit acquisition completed in september we are amortizing goodwill related to the ezlogin and spyonit acquisitions over months and months  respectively 
we have hired an independent third party appraiser to assist in the determination of the value of the goodwill and the other intangibles that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of tantau 
upon completion of this appraisal  we will determine the amount of the amortization charges that we will need to record as a result of this acquisition  and the period of time over which we will do so 
stock based compensation related to stock options stock based compensation has been allocated to the operating expense line items based on the nature of the services provided by the grantee 
stock based compensation was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  stock based compensation mainly represents the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire our common shares and the deemed fair market value  for financial reporting purposes  of our common shares on their respective grant dates 
this stock based compensation is being amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of these options  which is generally three years 
the increases are largely attributed to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to options that were granted between october  and march  stock based compensation also includes accrued stock consideration related to the yrless acquisition 
see recent acquisitions and note a of our consolidated financial statements 
a large percentage of our outstanding options have exercise prices that are significantly higher than the current prices at which our common shares trade on the nasdaq national market and the toronto stock exchange 
although we have not yet determined how we will address this issue  members of our management team are currently considering a variety of strategies 
these strategies include issuing additional options  lowering the exercise prices of our outstanding options  issuing additional options to personnel who agree to rescind all or a portion of their options  and or paying additional cash compensation to our personnel 
we may undertake a combination of these strategies  or develop new plans for compensating our personnel 
some of these strategies could require us to record very large cash or non cash compensation expenses 
however  because we have not yet determined the strategy or strategies that we will pursue  we cannot estimate at this time the precise impact that these actions will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  interest was derived from cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments  representing primarily the unused portion of the proceeds from our issuances of common shares  including  in particular  the proceeds from our initial public offering in the first quarter of equity in losses of affiliate our relative ownership in maptuit decreased from in march to in december this decrease is due to the additional financing that maptuit arranged with other investors 
our investment in maptuit is accounted for using the equity method 
in fiscal  we recognized a net gain of  including a dilution gain of million  as a result of maptuit s additional financing  offset by our share of maptuit s fiscal losses of net loss we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  our loss increased as we invested heavily in building our infrastructure 
in particular  our research and development expenses and our sales and marketing expenses increased to meet required product delivery schedules and to gain market share 
in  we expect our net loss to continue to increase as we expand our hosting services and continue to invest in developing our products 
net loss will also increase due to the non cash charges relating to amortization of intangibles arising from our acquisition of ezlogin and spyonit  which we purchased in  and tantau  which we purchased in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our revenue  before the offset of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenue our software development revenue  before the offset of stock based compensation  remained approximately the same at million for the years ended december  and all software development revenue realized in and related to our contract with bank of montreal 
service revenue our service revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from our entry into additional contracts for consulting and software design services for implementations at bank of montreal  bank of america and wells fargo 
stock based compensation related to software development revenue stock based compensation related to software development revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as we recognized a greater portion of the revenue associated with bank of montreal s license agreement in than in operating expenses cost of net revenue our cost of net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to the addition of implementation and customer service personnel to support additional customers in the increase in cost of services revenue also reflects amounts paid to third party consultants and software providers 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase largely reflects the addition of personnel to our research and development department  primarily to support the second release of our software 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  together with increased travel and related expenses 
this increase reflects the opening of sales offices in san francisco and london in general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   which reflects the increase in our corporate staff 
depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization expense excluding amortization of deferred stock based compensation increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   reflecting the capital spending in computer workstations and software development tools used for research and development purposes 
amortization of deferred employee stock based compensation in  we accrued a million deferred stock compensation charge related to employee stock options granted prior to our initial public offering 
amortization of employee stock based compensation was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   and has been included in the operating expense line items in which it relates 
in  we recognized  for deferred stock based compensation related to options that were granted to purchase  common shares under our stock option plans at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
interest income interest income  which increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   was derived from cash and cash equivalent balances  representing primarily the unused portion of the proceeds from our issuances of common shares 
net loss we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the loss per share  calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding  was for the year ended december  compared to a loss per share of for the year ended december  our losses increased as we invested heavily in building our infrastructure 
research and development  along with sales and marketing activities  increased to meet the required delivery schedules for our products and to establish customer relationships

in february  we completed our initial public offering of an aggregate of  of our common shares  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities for mainly consisted of our net loss of million and our net gain in equity of affiliate of  offset by depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million and net changes in working capital of million 
net changes in working capital includes an accrued liability for non recurring costs of million relating to the acquisition of tantau software 
cash provided from financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash flow from financing activities in reflects the net proceeds of our initial public offering and funds received from the exercise of stock options  as reduced by share issuance costs relating to our acquisitions of ezlogin and spyonit 
cash used in investing activities  before the purchase of short term investments  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  at december   short term investments mainly consisted of government debt and commercial paper with term to maturity of no greater than one year 
cash used in investing activities in  excluding the purchase of short term investments  reflects our investments in corillian  neomar and maptuit  our acquisitions of yrless  ezlogin and spyonit  acquisition costs related to tantau software  as well as purchases of capital and other assets 
capital expenditures for the year were million 
we anticipate capital expenditures to continue to increase as we continue to implement our data centers worldwide to support our hosting activities 
in addition  as at december   we had commitments to make minimum lease payments of approximately million in as a result of our purchase of tantau  we acquired approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  as of december   tantau had approximately million in commitments relating to facilities and equipment leases  which we are obligated to make as a result of our acquisition 
we expect that the revenue from our operations  interest income and the funds provided by our initial public offering will be sufficient to cover our cash requirements  including our planned capital expenditures  for at least the next months 
we may require additional financing if we expand our operations at a faster rate than currently expected  or if we seek to effect one or more significant acquisitions 
recent accounting policies and regulations in canada and the united states in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
 as recently amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  to date  we have not entered into derivative instruments 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s impact of interest rate exposure as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of which over million was short term investments 
a significant portion of the cash earns interest at variable rates 
in addition  although our short term investments are fixed rate instruments  the average term is short 
accordingly  our interest income is effectively sensitive to changes in the level of prevailing interest rates 
this is partially mitigated by the fact that we generally hold our short term investments until their maturity date 
impact of foreign exchange rate exposure our functional currency is the us dollar  however a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
with the purchase of tantau  we expect that an increased portion of our expenses will be incurred in euros and other european currencies 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the us dollar may result in currency translation gains and losses  which could affect our operating results 
in the year ended december   we realized foreign currency losses of approximately  in the future  we may seek to minimize this risk by hedging our known exposures  such as salaries  rent and certain other recurring payments 
we plan to account for any arrangements of this kind under canadian and us gaap in a manner consistent with financial accounting standards see note a to our consolidated financial statements
