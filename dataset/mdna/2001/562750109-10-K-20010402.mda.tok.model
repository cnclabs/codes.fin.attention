further  our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors which could cause variations in our quarterly revenue and operating results are delayed decisions by customers regarding purchases of software and services and or postponements of scheduled implementations and upgrades due to poor macro environmental or other economic outlooks  demand for our products  introductions of new products by our competitors  the level of price competition by our competitors  customers budgeting and purchasing cycles  delays in our implementations at customer sites  timing of hiring new services employees and the rate at which such employees become productive  development and performance of our direct and indirect sales channels  timing of any acquisitions and related costs  and identification of software quality problems 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue increases 
as a result  any shortfall in revenue in relation to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in quarterly losses 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly revenue and operating results to predict our future performance 
our ability to undertake new projects and increase revenue is substantially dependent on the availability of our professional services personnel to assist in the implementation of our software solutions 
we believe that supporting high growth in revenue requires us to rapidly hire additional  skilled professional services personnel  and there can be no assurance that qualified personnel could be located  trained or retained in a timely and cost effective manner 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful  and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in volatility in the price of the shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources since our initial public offering ipo in april  we have funded our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and the ipo proceeds 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  our operating activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in cash from operating activities arose principally from an increase in net income 
also contributing significantly was an increase in current liabilities greater than the increase in accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding declined from days at december  to days at december  we reflect refundable income taxes at december  of million arising principally from significant tax deductions for compensation expense associated with the exercise of stock options by employees in approximately million was received on an accelerated refund in the first quarter of our investing activities used approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our principal uses of cash were million as portion of the acquisition price of intrepa  as described below  and million for purchases of computer equipment and furniture and fixtures to support our growth partially offset by net sales of million in short term investments 
our financing activities provided approximately million in  million in  and million in the principal sources of cash provided by financing activities for and were the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options  partially reduced by the payments under capital lease obligations and repayment of a million note payable assumed as part of the purchase price of intrepa  as described below 
the principal source of cash provided by financing activities for was proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering partially reduced by distributions to shareholders prior to the initial public offering 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets of intrepa  llc intrepa for a purchase price of approximately million 
the purchase price consists of a cash payment of million  the issuance of approximately million of our 
par value per share common stock approximately  shares  and the issuance by us of a promissory note for million with quarterly payments over thirty months bearing interest at per annum 
we also incurred approximately million of transaction costs related to the acquisition 
the purchase price includes the assumption of substantially all of the liabilities of intrepa  including immediate payment by us of the remaining million of principal and up to  interest on a promissory note previously issued by intrepa 
we believe that existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least for the next twelve months 
new accounting pronouncement in june of  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we adopted the new statement on january  the statement did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange during  we commenced operations in europe 
total revenues for europe were approximately  and less than of our total revenues for the year ended december   and  respectively 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on us in  and were not material 
interest rates we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national governmental entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are derived from operations 
interest income on our investments is carried in other income  net on our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on investment securities at december  was approximately 
the fair value of securities held at december  was million
