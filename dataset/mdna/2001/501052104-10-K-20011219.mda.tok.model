item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion includes certain forward looking statements about kronos business and its expectations 
any such statements are subject to risk that could cause the actual results to vary materially from expectations 
for a further discussion of the various risks that may affect kronos business and expectations  see certain factors that may affect future operating results at the end of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations revenues 
revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
annual revenue growth amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the revenue growth rate experienced in fiscal was accelerated due to demand for new products  product upgrades and related services resulting from customers year compliance efforts 
product revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
product revenues increased in fiscal as compared to a decrease of in fiscal  and growth of in fiscal during fiscal  and principally during the last three quarters of the fiscal year  kronos experienced increased product sales volume and product revenue growth as a result of customer demand for platform and capacity upgrades from existing customers and demand for kronos new products 
contributing to the demand were product upgrades from existing customers using dos and unix products for which maintenance support was discontinued effective october  whereas kronos benefited from an accelerated sales cycle during fiscal due to customers year compliance efforts  it experienced a more lengthened sales cycle during fiscal that resulted in a product revenue decrease 
the extension of the sales cycle during fiscal was attributable to the combination of customers delaying investment in new applications after the significant investments made in preparation for the year and increased complexity in the sales process for kronos products and services 
the increased complexity in the sales process can be attributed to factors including more complex product technology and an increase in average transaction size 
service revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
service revenues grew by in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
service revenues amounted to  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth in service revenues in all periods reflects an increase in maintenance revenue from expansion of the installed base and the level of services sold to the installed base  as well as an increase in the level of professional services accompanying new and upgrade sales 
the expansion of the installed base results from the cumulative effect of adding new sales to the base  and the acquisition of dealers and other companies 
the increase in the level of services sold to the installed base is principally attributable to the upgrade of existing customers to kronos new products 
upgrade sales generally result in an increased level of maintenance and professional service revenues 
acquisitions provided approximately million  million and million of incremental service revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth in fiscal service revenues also reflects the increase in delivery of professional services resulting from improving the efficiency of kronos service organization 
as the installed base continues to grow  management anticipates that the proportion of service revenues to total revenues will continue to grow in fiscal international revenues  which include revenues from kronos international subsidiaries and sales to independent international dealers  amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues amounted to of total revenues in all fiscal years presented 
international revenues grew by and in fiscal and  respectively  as compared to in fiscal the higher growth rate experienced in fiscal was partially due to demand for new products  product upgrades and related services resulting from customers year compliance efforts as well as the result of lower than anticipated revenue from international operations in fiscal due to kronos initiatives to strengthen subsidiary management and to position the subsidiaries sales organizations to better penetrate their respective markets 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal and as compared to in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was favorably impacted by improvements in both product and service gross margin  offsetting the effect of a higher proportion of service revenues 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was directly attributable to the decrease in product revenues in that year 
service revenue  which generates lower gross margin  has grown faster than product revenue and represents a greater proportion of total revenue in fiscal and as compared to fiscal product gross profit as a percentage of product revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and the improvement in product gross margin in fiscal is principally attributable to favorable product mix 
software  which typically generates higher gross profit  was a greater proportion of product revenues during fiscal as compared to prior years 
the software component of product revenue increased to of total product revenues in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
higher software development amortization and higher production costs due to lower hardware sales volume partially offset the favorable product mix effect 
service gross profit as a percentage of service revenues was in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the improvement in service gross profit in each of the periods is primarily attributable to improving the efficiency in the delivery of services by leveraging investments in service systems and web based self service offerings  centralizing the software support function as well as reducing the number of product versions requiring support 
in addition  kronos has also focused on reducing discretionary spending and strengthening its billing practices for professional services  which has also improved service gross profit 
net operating expenses 
net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and the increase in net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal is attributable to special charges described below 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were in all fiscal years presented 
sales and marketing expenses were million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in all periods principally relates to increased business volume  and to a lesser extent  the impact of converting kronos dealer operations to direct sales operations 
engineering  research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in all fiscal years presented 
engineering  research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenses are net of capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively 
the growth in engineering  research and development expenses in fiscal resulted principally from the development of new web based software applications and hardware products 
the growth in engineering  research and development expenses in fiscal resulted principally from the development and integration of new products and acquired technologies 
increased spending in engineering  research and development reflects kronos commitment to new product development and further enhancement of existing products 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and the increase in amortization expense is related to acquisitions completed during fiscal and kronos amortizes these costs over the estimated remaining economic lives of the assets 
however  as discussed below  for acquisitions completed subsequent to june   kronos has applied new rules on accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets 
other income  net as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal and as compared to in fiscal other income  net is principally interest income earned from kronos cash as well as investments in its marketable securities and lease portfolio 
special charge 
a special charge in the amount of million related to the termination of kronos crosswinds technology operations was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal the crosswinds technology group  which was purchased in may  was responsible for the product development  marketing and sales support of time and attendance applications that operated as a microsoft outlook plug in product 
lower than anticipated sales of these applications  redundant infrastructure and ongoing operating losses resulted in the termination of the stand alone operating unit 
revenues in the first six months of fiscal generated by the crosswinds technology group were not material 
the million charge consists of million in termination costs  million for the write off of all related intangible assets and million in other costs 
cash outlays of approximately million relating to this action are anticipated to be paid over the next six months 
in addition  in order to streamline operations to better align costs with expected revenues  a special charge in the amount of million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal related to termination costs from a reduction in workforce of approximately employees 
the workforce reductions resulted in a pre tax savings of million in fiscal and is expected to result in annual savings of million going forward 
newly issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the statements 
under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
for acquisitions completed prior to june   kronos anticipates that it will apply the new rules on accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal for acquisitions completed after june   kronos has applied the rules  as they relate to no longer amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal as required by the statements 
kronos expects that the effect of the application of the non amortization provisions of the statements will result in an increase in net income of million  or 
per diluted share  in fiscal during fiscal  kronos will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october  kronos has not currently determined what effect  if any  these impairment tests may have on its earnings and financial position 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
kronos effective income tax rate may fluctuate between periods as a result of various factors  including income tax credits  amortization of goodwill for tax purposes and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources working capital as of september  amounted to million as compared with million at september  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  increased to million from million at september  cash provided by operations amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal is principally attributable to increased accrued compensation and collection of accounts receivable from trade customers as well as the net effect of changes to kronos deferred tax asset related to multi year maintenance contracts 
these factors are partially offset by a reduced rate of increase in kronos deferred maintenance and professional service revenues 
the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal was principally attributable to a reduced rate of increase in kronos deferred maintenance and professional service revenues  lower earnings and related compensation accruals  as well as the use of cash for guaranteed acquisition related payments due during fiscal partially offsetting these items were cash flows from increased collection of accounts receivable from trade customers and a reduced rate of investment in kronos lease portfolio 
also contributing to the increase in operating cash flows in all periods presented were non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization 
it is kronos policy to bill accompanying professional services and maintenance contracts when the product is invoiced 
kronos has experienced growth in deferred maintenance and professional service revenues in all periods presented as the result of the expansion of the installed base and an increase in the level of professional services accompanying new sales and sales to kronos existing customer base 
kronos investment in property  plant and equipment in all periods presented includes investments in information systems and infrastructure to improve and support expanding operations 
in fiscal and kronos investment included the development and construction of its corporate headquarters campus 
kronos use of cash for the acquisition of businesses in all fiscal years is principally related to acquisitions of specified assets and or businesses of kronos dealers and or other providers of labor management solutions 
these acquisitions did not have a material impact on results of operations in any of the periods presented 
kronos is assessing several acquisition opportunities that may be completed over the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will be completed 
excess cash reserves not required for operations  investments in property  plant and equipment or acquisitions are invested in marketable securities 
marketable securities increased by million in fiscal compared to a decrease of million in fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal under kronos stock repurchase program  kronos has repurchased   and  common shares in fiscal  and  respectively  at a cost of million  million and million  respectively 
the common shares repurchased under the program are used for kronos employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  kronos repurchases common stock from employees in connection with the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by operations was more than sufficient to fund investments in property  plant and equipment  capitalized software development costs  acquisitions of businesses and stock repurchases in fiscal  and kronos believes it has adequate cash and investments and operating cash flow to fund its investments in property  plant and equipment  software development costs  cash payments related to acquisitions and stock repurchases  if any  for the foreseeable future 
certain factors that may affect future operating results except for historical matters  the matters discussed in the annual report and or form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
kronos desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing itself of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors  among others  could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and or form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
potential fluctuations in results 
kronos operating results  including revenue growth  sources of revenue  effective tax rate and liquidity  may be affected as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of the introduction of new products and product enhancements by kronos and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  general economic conditions  the purchasing patterns of kronos customers  the strategy employed by kronos to enter the human resource hr payroll market  the mix of products and services sold  and competitive pricing pressure 
kronos historically has realized a relatively larger percentage of its annual revenues and profits in the fourth quarter and a relatively smaller percentage in the first quarter of each fiscal year  although there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue 
in addition  while kronos has contracts to supply systems to certain customers over an extended period of time  substantially all of kronos product revenue and profits in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
if near term demand for kronos products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  kronos revenues for that quarter will be adversely affected 
kronos believes that its operating results for any one period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
events of september  no kronos employees were lost or injured  and no kronos properties or records were damaged  as a result of the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september  although operations during that week were hampered by the temporary disruption of the transportation and communications infrastructure as well as the general impact on business activity  management does not believe the impact has been material to date 
however  at this time  it is not possible to predict the long term impact of these events  or the domestic and foreign response  on either our industry as a whole or on our operations and financial condition in particular 
product development and technological change 
continual change and improvement in computer software and hardware technology characterize the markets for frontline labor management systems 
kronos future success will depend largely on its ability to enhance the capabilities and increase the performance of its existing products and to develop new products and interfaces to third party products on a timely basis to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
although kronos is continually seeking to further enhance its product offerings and to develop new products and interfaces  including products for the hr payroll market  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that  if successful  such product enhancements or new products will achieve widespread market acceptance  or that kronos competitors will not develop and market products which are superior to kronos products or achieve greater market acceptance 
dependence on time and attendance product line 
to date  more than of the kronos revenues have been attributable to sales of time and attendance systems and related services 
although kronos has announced its intention to enter the licensed hr payroll market in fiscal  kronos expects that its dependence on the time and attendance product line for revenues will continue in the next fiscal year 
competitive pressures or other factors could cause kronos time and attendance products to lose market acceptance or experience significant price erosion  adversely affecting the results of kronos operations 
dependence on alternate distribution channels 
kronos markets and sells its products through its direct sales organization  independent dealers and an oem 
in fiscal  approximately of kronos revenue was generated through sales to dealers and the oem 
management does not anticipate that its intention to enter the hr payroll market will have a negative impact on its relationship with its oem 
however  a reduction in the sales efforts of kronos major dealers and or its oem  or termination or changes in their relationships with the kronos  could have a material adverse affect on the results of kronos operations 
competition 
the frontline labor management industry and the hr payroll market are highly competitive 
the number of competitors is also increasing as applications and systems providers such as human resources management  payroll processing and enterprise resource planning erp  enter these markets 
technological changes such as those allowing for increased use of the internet have also resulted in new entrants into the markets 
although kronos believes it has core competencies that are not easily obtainable by competitors  maintaining kronos technological and other advantages over competitors will require continued investment by kronos in research and development  marketing and sales programs 
there can be no assurance that kronos will have sufficient resources to make such investments or be able to achieve the technological advances necessary to maintain its competitive advantages 
increased competition could adversely affect kronos operating results through price reductions and or loss of market share 
attracting and retaining sufficient technical personnel for product development  support and sales 
kronos has encountered intense competition for experienced technical personnel for product development  technical support and sales and expects such competition to continue in the future 
any inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel could adversely affect kronos ability to produce  support and sell products in a timely manner 
reliance on key vendors 
kronos depends upon the reliability and viability of a variety of software development tools owned by third parties to develop its products 
if these tools are inadequate or not properly supported  kronos ability to release competitive products in a timely manner could be adversely impacted 
also  certain parts and components used in kronos hardware products are purchased from single suppliers 
kronos has chosen to source these items from single suppliers because it believes that the supplier chosen is able to consistently provide kronos with the highest quality product at a competitive price on a timely basis 
kronos intends to complete development and release an alternative hardware product during fiscal that is anticipated to have the same reliance on single suppliers 
while kronos has to date been able to obtain adequate supplies of these parts and components  kronos inability to transition to alternate sources on a timely basis if and as required in the future could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could have a material adverse affect on kronos results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s marketable securities that expose it to market rate risks are comprised of debt securities 
a decrease in interest rates would not adversely impact interest income or related cash flows pertaining to securities held at september   as all of these securities have fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not adversely impact the fair value of these securities by a material amount due to the size and average duration of the portfolio 
the company s exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency relate primarily to the amounts due from subsidiaries 
exchange gains and losses related to amounts due from subsidiaries have not been material 
for foreign currency exposures existing at september   a unfavorable movement in the foreign exchange rates for each subsidiary location would not expose the company to material losses in earnings or cash flows 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar
