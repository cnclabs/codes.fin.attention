item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cryolife  inc was organized in to address market opportunities in the area of biological implantable products and materials  and today is the leader in the preservation of viable human tissue for cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic applications 
the company pays a fee to an organ procurement agency or tissue bank at the time such organization consigns human tissue to the company 
the company generates revenues from preservation services by charging hospitals a fee  which covers the company s services  the associated procurement fee  and applicable shipping expenses 
the company records revenue upon shipping tissue 
costs associated with the procurement  processing  and storage of tissue are accounted for as deferred preservation costs on the company s consolidated balance sheet and are expensed when the tissue is shipped 
through a series of acquisitions of intellectual property and businesses  the company has expanded its portfolio of products and services 
as a result  the company also develops implantable biomaterials  including bioglue surgical adhesive  which is approved for distribution in countries  synergraft  a tissue engineering technology which incorporates the use of decellularized animal tissues with the potential to remodel in vivo  and other stentless porcine heart valves that are approved for distribution internationally 
in  the company also acquired the assets of ucfi  a tissue processor  for  in cash and a million note 
in  the company acquired ideas for medicine  inc ifm and its line of single use medical devices for million in cash  and a million convertible debenture 
on september  the company completed the sale of substantially all of the ifm product line and certain related assets to horizon medical products  inc hmp for million in cash pursuant to an asset purchase agreement 
concurrently  ifm and hmp signed a manufacturing agreement the agreement which provided for the manufacture by ifm of specified minimum dollar amounts of ifm products to be purchased exclusively by hmp over each of the four years following the sale 
thereafter  responsibility for such manufacturing was to be assumed by hmp 
the company recorded a deferred gain at the transaction date totaling million  representing the selling price less the net book value of the assets sold  which included million of goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  and the costs related to the sale 
the gain was deferred because the sale and the manufacturing agreements represent  in the aggregate  a single transaction for which the related income should be recognized over the term of the agreement 
accordingly  the deferred gain was reflected in cost of goods sold during and to maintain margins that would have been approximately equal over the four year period of the agreement on the products manufactured and sold by ifm to hmp 
during and amortization of deferred revenue totaled million and  respectively 
as more fully discussed under nonrecurring charges in the results of operations section  hmp defaulted on the agreement in june of on october  the company sold substantially all of the remaining assets of ideas for medicine  inc ifm to horizon medical products  inc 
hmp 
the assets consisted primarily of inventory  equipment and leasehold improvements which had a net book value of million at the date of sale 
the transaction provided for hmp to pay the company the sum of approximately million  payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of  the note consists of a portion  approximately million  which bears interest at per year  and a non interest bearing portion of approximately million 
the note also requires an additional million principal payment at any time prior to april  if the million payment is made when due  and no other defaults exist under the note  then million of the non interest bearing portion of the note will be forgiven 
in addition  at such time as the principal balance has been paid down to million and there have been no defaults under the promissory note  the remainder of the note will be forgiven and the note will be canceled 
the company has recorded reserves against these notes such that the gain from the sale is deferred until the full amount of the note is deemed collectible 
on march   hmp transferred the ifm assets to a wholly owned subsidiary of vascutech  inc and the hmp note was assumed by the vascutech subsidiary 
the assumed note is guaranteed by vascutech  inc the composition of the company s revenues is expected to change in future years  reflecting  among other things  the anticipated growth in shipments of human vascular tissue and human connective tissue for the knee  and the introduction of bioglue surgical adhesive into domestic and international markets  as well as other expected new products 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased acceptance in the medical community of preserved tissues which has resulted in increased demand for the company s preservation services  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  revenues attributable to the company s introduction of bioglue surgical adhesive in domestic markets in january of  and other reasons discussed below 
these increases in revenues have been offset by certain decreases in revenues as discussed below 
revenues from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues resulted from a increase in the number of heart allograft shipments due to increased demand 
revenues from human vascular tissue cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of vascular allograft shipments due to an increased demand for saphenous vein  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  and the growth in demand for the company s cryopreserved femoral vein for dialysis access 
revenues from human connective tissue of the knee cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of allograft shipments due to increased acceptance of osteoarticular grafts and non bone tendons by the orthopaedic surgeon community and the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue 
revenues from the sale of bioglue surgical adhesive increased to million for from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in revenues is due to a increase in the number of milliliter shipment s of bioglue 
the increase in shipments was primarily due to the introduction of bioglue in domestic markets in january of pursuant to a humanitarian use device exemption for the use of bioglue as an adjunct in the repair of acute thoracic aortic dissections  as well as greater product awareness since the introduction of bioglue in international markets in april of  increased surgeon training  and the receipt of the ce approval for pulmonary indications in europe in march revenues from bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices decreased to  in from  in  representing of total revenues during such periods 
this decrease in revenues is primarily due to the company s focus on the start up of the synergraft heart valve manufacturing process  which adversely impacted its ability to manufacture other bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices 
revenues from ifm decreased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the decrease in revenues is due to hmp s default under its manufacturing agreement and to the sale of the remaining assets of ifm to hmp 
grant revenues decreased to  in from  in grant revenues are primarily attributable to the synergraft research and development programs 
cost of cryopreservation services and products aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues 
the decrease in the cost of cryopreservation services and products as a percentage of revenues results from an increase in revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive  which carry higher gross margins than cryopreservation services  and from a greater portion of orthopaedic cryopreservation revenues being derived from services that have higher gross margins than other orthopaedic cryopreservation services  partially offset by a lesser portion of revenues being derived from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services  which carry higher gross margins than other cryopreservation services 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing of total cryopreservation and product revenues for each period 
the increase in expenditures in resulted from expenses incurred to support the increase in revenues and expenses associated with the establishment of the company s european headquarters 
research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing of total cryopreservation and product revenues for each period 
research and development spending relates principally to the company s ongoing human clinical trials for its bioglue surgical adhesive and to its focus on its synergraft and bioglue technologies 
as more fully discussed in the following comparison of years ended december  and december   the company recorded a nonrecurring charge of million in primarily as a result of hmp s default on its manufacturing contract with ifm 
net interest income was million and in and  respectively 
this increase in interest income was due primarily to the increase in cash generated from operations during the year ended december  the effective income tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased acceptance in the medical community of cryopreserved tissues  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  price increases for certain cryopreservation services instituted during the third quarter of which continued during  a full year of bioglue international revenue in as compared to nine months in  and revenues attributable to the company s introduction of osteoarticular grafts in january these increases in revenues have been offset by certain decreases in revenues as discussed below 
revenues from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services decreased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this decrease in revenues resulted from an decrease in the number of heart allograft shipments  which decrease consisted primarily of a decrease in the number of pulmonary heart valve shipments due to a decrease in the number of ross procedures being performed and competitive price pressures on pulmonary valves 
in a ross procedure  the patient s pulmonary valve is transplanted into the aortic position and a human pulmonary allograft is transplanted into the patient s pulmonary position 
the company has attempted to promote the positive clinical results of the ross procedure by hosting science forums around the country with its cardiovascular surgeon customers 
revenues from human vascular tissue cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of vascular allograft shipments attributable to an increased demand for preserved vascular tissue  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  and the introduction of the femoral vein program for use as a v shunts in dialysis patients 
the increase in revenues was also due to the company s focus on procuring and distributing long segment veins  which have a higher per unit revenue than the short segment veins 
revenues from human connective tissue of the knee cryopreservation services increased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of allograft shipments due to increased demand  the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue  and the introduction of preserved osteoarticular grafts in january of additional revenue increases resulted from price increases for the cryopreservation of menisci and tendons during the third quarter of revenues from ifm decreased to million in from million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the decrease in revenues is due to hmp s failure to meet the minimum purchase requirements set forth in the agreement as more fully discussed below 
revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive increased to million for from  in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in revenues is due to a increase in the volume of milliliter shipments of bioglue due to increased product awareness as a result of the introduction of bioglue in international markets in april of  increased surgeon training  and the receipt of the ce mark approval for the use of bioglue for pulmonary indications in europe in march revenues from bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices increased to  in from  in  representing of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was due to a increase in the number of bioprosthetic cardiovascular device shipments due to an increase in demand  a full year of international revenues from the cryolife ross pulmonary valve in as compared to three months of revenues in  and price increases in november of that continued throughout grant revenues increased to  in from  in this increase in grant revenues is primarily attributable to the synergraft research and development programs 
other income decreased to  in from million in other income in relates primarily to proceeds from the sale of the company s port product line 
cost of cryopreservation services and products aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues 
the increase of the cost of cryopreservation services and products as a percentage of revenues in results from a smaller percentage of revenues being derived from human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services  which carry a significantly higher gross margin than other cryopreservation services 
an additional reason for the increase in costs in results from the switch in october of to oem manufacturing of single use medical devices  which generates lower gross margins than cryopreservation services and lower gross margins than the ifm products generated prior to the sale of the ifm product line 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues in such periods 
the increase in expenditures in resulted from expenses incurred to support the increase in revenues  partially offset by increased absorption of overhead expenses associated with increased production of new products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total cryopreservation and product revenues for each period 
research and development spending relates principally to the company s focus on its bioadhesives and synergraft technologies 
the company recorded a nonrecurring pretax charge of million in primarily as a result of hmp s default on its manufacturing contract with ifm 
on june  ifm notified hmp that it was in default of certain provisions of the agreement 
specifically  hmp was in violation of the payment provisions contained within the agreement  which calls for inventory purchases to be paid for within days of delivery 
additionally  hmp was in violation due to nonpayment of interest related to such past due accounts receivable 
after notification of the default  hmp indicated to the company that it would not be able to meet and did not met the minimum purchase requirements outlined in the agreement 
due to the significant uncertainties related to the company s ability to realize its investment in ifm  the company determined that it had incurred an impairment loss on its ifm assets 
in calculating the amount of the impairment loss  management used its best estimate to determine the realizable value of its increase in working capital due to the hmp default  and the recoverability of ifm s long lived assets  consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and equipment 
as a result  management recorded a million impairment loss on working capital and a million impairment loss on leasehold improvements 
additionally  the company offset the above charges with million of deferred gain recorded in connection with the sale of the ifm product line to hmp 
the net pretax effect of the above nonrecurring charges is million  and has been included under the caption nonrecurring charges in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
as previously discussed in the overview section  on october  the company sold substantially all of the remaining assets of ifm to hmp 
net interest income was million and  in and  respectively 
this increase in interest income is due to recording a full year of interest income on the invested proceeds from the follow on equity offering the offering completed in april  lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of certain indebtedness with the proceeds from the offering  and the conversion of certain convertible debentures into common stock of the company 
the increase in the effective income tax rate to in from in  is the result of the nonrecurrence of income tax benefits realized in from the implementation of certain income tax planning strategies in the fourth quarter  which had a significant one time impact on taxes 
despite the increase in the tax rate between and  the effective tax rate is reflective of the ongoing impact of these tax planning strategies 
seasonality the demand for the company s human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services is seasonal  with peak demand generally occurring in the second and third quarters 
management believes this trend for human heart valve and conduit cryopreservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months 
however  the demand for the company s human connective tissue of the knee cryopreservation services  human vascular tissue cryopreservation services  bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices  and bioglue surgical adhesive does not appear to experience seasonal trends 
liquidity and capital resources at december  net working capital was million  compared to million at december   with a current ratio of to the company s primary capital requirements arise out of general working capital needs  capital expenditures for facilities and equipment  funding of research and development projects  and a common stock repurchase plan approved by the board of directors in october of the company historically has funded these requirements through bank credit facilities  cash generated by operations  and equity offerings 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in this increase primarily resulted from an increase in net income  a decrease in accounts receivable despite increased revenues  a reduction in the growth of deferred preservation costs and inventories  and an increase in the amount of accounts payable due to the timing of payments of outstanding invoices  partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  as compared to million in this increase in cash used was primarily attributable to a increase in capital expenditures due to the expansion of the company s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities  partially offset by an increase in sales of marketable equity securities during net cash provided by financing activities was million in  as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in this increase was primarily attributable to the proceeds received on the bank line of credit to finance the expansion of the company s headquarters and manufacturing facilities  a reduction in the company s repurchase of treasury stock during and an increase in the proceeds from stock option exercises 
management is currently seeking to complete a potential private placement of equity or equity oriented securities to form a subsidiary company for the commercial development of its serine proteinase light activation technologies through its wholly owned subsidiary aurazyme pharmaceutical  inc this strategy  if successful  will allow an affiliated entity to fund the light activation technology and should expedite the commercial development of its blood clot dissolving and surgical sealant product applications without additional research and development expenditures by the company other than through the affiliated company 
this strategy  if successful  will favorably impact the company s liquidity going forward 
the company has ceased further material development of light activation technology pending the identification of a corporate partner to fund future development 
the company anticipates that current cash and marketable securities  cash generated from operations and its million of bank facilities of which million was drawn as of march  will be sufficient to meet its operating and development needs for at least the next months  including the expansion of the company s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities 
however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements beyond that period will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing of the company s receipt of fda approvals to begin clinical trials for its products currently in development  the resources required to further develop its marketing and sales capabilities if and when those products gain approval  the resources required for any additional expansion of its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  and the extent to which the company s products generate market acceptance and demand 
there can be no assurance the company will not require additional financing or will not seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings  or other sources of capital to meet future requirements 
these additional funds may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million in municipal obligations as of december   as well as interest paid on its debt 
at march   approximately million of the company s debt charged interest at a variable rate 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us interest rates  the company generally maintains approximately approximately million at march  of its debt as fixed rate in nature 
as a result  the company is subject to a risk that interest rates will decrease and the company may be unable to refinance its debt
