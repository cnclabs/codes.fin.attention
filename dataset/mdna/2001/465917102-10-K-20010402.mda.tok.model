net gain on real estate sales for the year ended december  of million represents net gains on the sale of five shopping center properties during net gain on real estate sales for the year ended december  of  represents a gain on the sale of two parcels of land in tenant settlement in april  the company announced the discovery of discrepancies in cost and other information underlying certain leases and real estate sales agreements with the company s two largest tenants  wal mart and lowe s collectively  the major anchor tenants 
the company determined that these discrepancies may have affected the negotiation of rental rates and purchase prices paid by the major anchor tenants on transactions with the company and jdn development 
after further investigation and discussions with the major anchor tenants  the company  jdn development and the major anchor tenants entered into an estoppel and release on may  the settlement agreement which settled potential claims resulting from these discrepancies 
material terms of the settlement agreement included the following 
the company  jdn development and the major anchor tenants reaffirmed the terms of all existing leases without modification  restatement or adjustment  
the company  jdn development and the major anchor tenants reaffirmed all previously consummated real estate sales transactions without modification  restatement or adjustment  and 
the company and jdn development agreed to pay the major anchor tenants an aggregate of million  million to each of the major anchor tenants

as a further inducement to enter into the settlement agreement  the company and jdn development agreed to reduce the selling price by million of three supercenters which the company and jdn development intended to sell to wal mart

of the amount the company recorded  approximately million relates to operating shopping centers that are being actively marketed for sale or already sold  approximately million relates to operating shopping centers currently in use  million relates to non operating real estate and million relates to an impaired mortgage note receivable 
all amounts recorded at jdn development relate to non operating real estate 
additional impairment losses may be recognized in the future as the company looks to the disposition of operating shopping center properties and the sale of various parcels of land adjacent to its operating properties as a significant source of funding development activities 
funds from operations funds from operation ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc to mean net income  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the company s ability to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company s method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo does not represent cash provided by operating activities as defined by gaap  should not be considered an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of operating performance and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs  including the company s ability to make cash distributions 
the company has presented below the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated years ended december  in thousands net income attributable to common shareholders    depreciation of real estate assets    amortization of tenant allowances and tenant improvements amortization of deferred leasing commissions impairment losses on shopping centers held for sale  net gain on real estate sales   adjustments related to activities in unconsolidated entities  ffo    development the company s primary business has historically been to develop shopping centers anchored by retailers such as  for example  lowe s and wal mart 
the company and jdn development have also historically developed for other retailers such as kohl s  kroger and petsmart 
further  the company and jdn development are involved in development activities with different secondary anchor tenants such as best buy and bed  bath and beyond 
the company and jdn development expect to continue to pursue development opportunities with retailers with which they have traditionally worked while broadening the tenant and product mix to include grocers and grocery anchored shopping centers 
management intends to become more selective in the development projects it approves with a focus on location characteristics in high barrier to entry markets with demographic attributes that allow for net operating income growth over time 
as a result of management adopting more selective criteria when considering new developments  along with other factors  such as cost of capital  management changes and changing relations with retail customers  the company expects that the volume of new development projects will decrease over the next to months 
this reduction in activity may cause the rate of historical growth in revenues to decrease and income from land sales and development fees at jdn development to decrease 
these decreases could affect the company s ability to increase its dividend to shareholders from its current level 
leasing and tenant information the properties of the company and jdn development were leased as of december   leased as of december  and leased as of december  the increase from to is primarily attributable to the leasing of a portion of a previously vacant anchor space at one of the company s shopping center properties 
the decrease from to is primarily attributable to the termination of an anchor tenant lease at one of the company s shopping center properties  and to vacancies at newly developed shopping centers and shopping centers with unleased space acquired by the company as redevelopment opportunities 
the properties that the company and jdn development owned and operated for all of and were  and leased as of december   and  respectively 
the company derives the majority of its rental income and development activities from the retail industry  and as such  is exposed to adverse trends or events affecting segments of the retail industry 
as of december   the company and jdn development were exposed to the following segments of the retail industry percentage of type annualized base rent home improvement supermarket discount restaurant discount department stores apparel home goods theatre office supplies drug store the theatre segment is currently experiencing the fallout of aggressive expansion of new  multi screen facilities 
recently  several companies operating theatres have filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
of the company s six leases with theatre companies  three are with companies who have filed for chapter protection representing of annualized base rent 
as of march   two of these leases have been modified for rental rate reductions totaling approximately million  one of which has been approved by the bankruptcy court 
the third lease also has not been assumed  but currently has no provision for rental rate reduction 
rejection of one or more of these leases or modification resulting in rate reductions could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds historically  the company s primary sources of funds have been cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from lines of credit  term debt  secured mortgage notes payable  debt and equity offerings  and shopping center sales 
the company s primary uses of funds have historically been development  redevelopment and acquisition of shopping center properties  distributions to shareholders  repayment of outstanding indebtedness  repurchase of common stock  scheduled debt amortization  leasing costs and capital improvements to its existing shopping center properties 
the company generally has used cash provided by operating activities to fund its distributions to shareholders  capital improvements to existing properties and scheduled debt amortization 
the company has used proceeds from its lines of credit  term debt  secured mortgage notes payable  debt and equity offerings and shopping center sales to repay outstanding indebtedness  to repurchase common stock and to fund its ongoing development  redevelopment and acquisition activities 
during  the company incurred million in development costs  invested million in partnerships that were formed to develop shopping center properties and advanced million to jdn development to fund its development and redevelopment activities 
to fund these development activities  the company and jdn development sold all or portions of shopping centers and two vacant parcels of land for net proceeds of approximately million and million respectively 
in addition  the company utilized approximately million of the proceeds held by a qualified intermediary in connection with a section tax free deferred exchange to fund its development activities 
during the first quarter of  the company repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock for approximately million at an average price of approximately per share under a share repurchase program that has since been discontinued

floating rate debt exposure is limited through investment in financial derivatives 
as of december   million of the million was hedged with a libor cap of on million which was terminated by the company upon closing of the credit agreement and a million swap with a fixed rate of which expired on january  as a result of the undisclosed compensation and related party transactions discussed elsewhere in this report  from april  to may  the company was deemed to be in default under the credit agreements related to its then existing primary line of credit and term loan 
on may   the company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the secured line of credit and an amended and restated term loan agreement the secured term loan  each effective as of may  the secured line of credit and the secured term loan collectively referred to herein as the secured credit agreements 
significant changes in the secured line of credit as compared to the revolving line of credit it replaced included the following 
reduced maximum borrowings allowed from million to million  
changed the maturity date from may to june  
changed the facility from unsecured to secured  
increased the borrowing rate from libor plus to libor plus 
increased the facility fee payable quarterly from 
to 
of the maximum loan amount  
increased the limit on the ratio of consolidated liabilities to gross asset value from to  and deleted the covenants limiting the ratios of unencumbered assets to total unsecured funded debt and unsecured noi to unsecured interest expense  all as defined  and 
further restricted the company s ability to pay distributions to shareholders 
the secured term loan amended the then existing term loan to  among other things 
increase the borrowing rate from libor plus to libor plus  
change the maturity date from february to june  and 
change the facility from unsecured to secured 
in the fourth quarter of  the company executed a consent and first amendment to the second amended and restated credit agreement for the secured line of credit and a similar amendment for the secured term loan the amendments  each effective as of september  the amendments modified the secured credit agreements as follows 
reduced the borrowing rate from libor plus to libor plus  
modified the definition of secured debt to include all debt secured by real property  and 
modified the provisions for replacement properties as defined in the secured credit agreement 
on march   the company closed a third amended and restated master credit agreement with fleet national bank as agent the credit agreement  replacing the existing secured credit agreements 
the credit agreement provides for maximum borrowings of million  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
loans made pursuant to the credit agreement will initially bear interest at libor plus and will range from libor plus to libor plus based on company leverage and credit quality 
the credit agreement matures december the credit agreement provides that the loans thereunder will be initially secured by first priority security interests in properties valued at approximately million 
the company may  however  add  remove or substitute certain of its other properties as borrowing base properties subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain requirements for each property within the borrowing base properties and certain value and occupancy requirements for the borrowing base properties in the aggregate 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants including  but not limited to  a liabilities to assets ratio  fixed charges coverage ratios and a net worth covenant 
in addition  the credit agreement restricts  subject to certain exceptions  the amount of distributions to the company s shareholders to of the company s funds from operations as defined in the credit agreement 
the company incurred fees and expenses associated with the closing of the credit agreement of approximately million 
during  the company entered into a two year forward interest rate cap on million of its floating rate debt 
the cap effectively limited the floating one month libor rate on its secured term loan to or less over a two year period 
upon closing of the credit agreement  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that effectively fixes the underlying libor rate at 
future sources and uses of funds the most significant expected use of capital for the company is its development activities 
as of december   the company  jdn development and affiliated entities had projects under construction and intend to commence construction during on approximately five additional projects 
the company expects that the capital required to fund the future costs of these projects  net of estimated construction reimbursements and expected land sales to retailers who will build and own their space in these projects  is approximately million 
these future costs are expected to be incurred during the remainder of and this projected capital requirement includes a number of assumptions including commitments by secondary anchor tenants 
if some or all of these tenants do not execute leases  management anticipates that the amount required to finance these projects will be less 
another potential use of capital is the satisfaction of any liabilities arising out of pending litigation and governmental proceedings 
as noted in note  the company is a party to certain litigation and government regulatory proceedings and may become subject to additional litigation or proceedings in the future 
these matters may result in liabilities  fines  penalties or other remedies that  if material  could adversely affect the company s financial condition  future results of operations and liquidity 
the company believes that cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund its required distributions to shareholders of taxable income for the year ended december  and of taxable income for each year thereafter  improvements to the company s operating shopping centers  leasing costs and scheduled debt amortization 
the company has historically utilized the public debt and equity markets to fund its development activities 
however  the company believes that it will be unable to issue unsecured debt  common stock or preferred stock as a result of  among other things  unfavorable capital markets for the foreseeable future 
also  because of the delay in filing the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   and the delay in filing the company s quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march   the company is not currently eligible to issue securities under its form s and will not be eligible to use form s until it has made timely filings of periodic reports with the sec for at least twelve calendar months after august therefore  even if capital markets were to become more favorable for the issuance of securities  public issuances of debt or equity securities before august would be costly and require significant time to consummate 
furthermore  the company is limited on the amount of debt that may be outstanding at any given time 
under the applicable indentures for its mopprs  seven year notes and ten year notes  and the credit agreement  the company is limited in the amount of secured debt it may have outstanding to of its consolidated total assets  as defined 
as of december   the company s ratio of secured debt to consolidated total assets was 
under the credit agreement  the company is limited in the amount of total debt it may have outstanding to of total consolidated assets  as defined 
as of december   the company s ratio of total debt to total consolidated assets  as defined  was 
the company is also restricted on additional indebtedness in its interest coverage and fixed charges coverage ratios in the credit agreements 
therefore  the company has only a limited ability to fund its development projects with proceeds from additional indebtedness 
the company and jdn development expect the sale of all or portions of operating shopping center properties in addition to the sale of various parcels of land adjacent to its operating properties to be the primary source of capital for the company to fund its development needs and certain other uses of funds noted above 
in addition  the company expects funds from the sale of its properties in and to be used to satisfy potential liabilities arising out of pending litigation  governmental proceedings and settlement agreements with respect to certain undisclosed transactions 
during  the company and jdn development sold all or portions of shopping center properties and two parcels of land for gross proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   the company and jdn development were negotiating the sale of all or portions of shopping centers with an aggregate net book value of approximately million for estimated aggregate proceeds of approximately million  of which were subject to definitive agreements at that date 
the company expects that most of these properties will be sold in and the first half of as of march   the company had closed on the sale of three of these shopping center properties for net proceeds of approximately million 
the company expects to begin marketing for sale additional shopping centers that are expected to close after the first half of the closing of the dispositions is dependent upon  among other things  completion of due diligence and the ability of some of the purchasers to successfully obtain financing 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any of these transactions will close when expected or at all  and there can be no assurance that  if closed  the disposition transactions will produce sufficient liquidity to enable the company to fund its planned development projects 
the company also expects to obtain construction loans on certain development projects to help fund its expected development expenditures 
the ability to obtain construction loans will be dependent upon a number of factors  including achievement of adequate pre leasing of the project and satisfaction of any environmental  title or other issues with respect to the underlying real estate 
the company has engaged a financial advisor in the implementation of the company strategy and in particular  assistance with financing alternatives 
these alternative means could include  for example  the formation of joint ventures with institutional investors or other partners with available capital at attractive rates 
management believes that proceeds from asset sales  construction loans and any additional capital identified by its financial advisor will provide the additional funding necessary to complete its current development pipeline 
however  if the company is unsuccessful in raising capital adequate to fund its development activities  it will be required to discontinue the funding of some or all of its projects and will be required to liquidate some or all of its projects on potentially unfavorable terms 
these unfavorable terms could result in significant losses upon liquidation and would have an adverse impact on future rental income  ffo and the company s ability to continue the level of its current distributions to holders of its common stock 
in order for the company to continue to qualify as a reit  it must annually distribute to its shareholders at least or after december  of its taxable income excluding net capital gains 
management believes that the company will be able to meet this requirement in with cash provided by operating activities 
as of december   the company s indebtedness requires the following payments in the future percent of debt year total expiring thereafter  with the closing of the credit agreement  the company has refinanced million of the million of its indebtedness maturing in the company is negotiating to refinance a million mortgage note payable secured by a shopping center in denver  colorado which matures july  the company expects this refinancing to close on or before the maturity date of this indebtedness 
with respect to its other maturing obligations  management will evaluate various alternatives and select the best available options based on market conditions at the time 
there can be no assurance  however  that the debt or equity capital markets will be favorable or available in the future  and unfavorable or unavailable markets could limit the company s ability to continue to operate its business as it has in the past  complete development projects or repay or refinance maturing debt 
derivatives and market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its indebtedness  which could impact its financial condition and results of operations 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
the company has and may from time to time in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap agreements in an attempt to hedge its exposure to increasing interest rates 
management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 
the company intends to use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   the company had one interest rate swap agreement and one interest rate cap agreement as described below strike effective termination value at description of agreement notional amount price date date libor  day rate swap   libor  day rate cap   a positive value indicates the theoretical net proceeds to the company if the indicated agreement is sold  while a negative value indicates the theoretical cost to terminate the transaction 
the company paid a one time  fee 
in conjunction with the closing of the credit agreement  the company terminated the interest rate cap agreement that was due to expire in august and entered into an interest rate swap agreement at a strike price of on million of the company s floating rate debt 
the swap will expire on december  the company s future earnings  cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are primarily dependent upon market rates of interest such as libor 
based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december  see indebtedness above  a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease future annual earnings by approximately million  cash flows by approximately million and fair value of debt by approximately million 
based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease future annual earnings by approximately  cash flows by approximately million and fair value of debt by approximately million

federal income tax legislative developments in  legislation was enacted which contained several provisions affecting reits 
the new provisions became effective january  and significantly modify the reit related provisions of the code 
in addition to the provisions that directly affect the company discussed below  the legislation also contained provisions relating to the following i special foreclosure rules for healthcare reits  ii clarification of the definition of independent contractors  and iii modification of the earnings and profits rules 
investment limitations the reit asset tests are modified by adding a requirement that except for i safe harbor debt and ii the ownership of stock in taxable reit subsidiaries  a reit cannot own more than percent of the total value of the securities of any corporation 
safe harbor debt is non contingent  non convertible debt straight debt which satisfies one of the following three requirements a the straight debt is issued by an individual  b all of the securities of the issuer owned by the reit is straight debt or c the issuer is a partnership in which the reit owns at least of the partnership s profits 
taxable reit subsidiaries a reit will be permitted to operate a taxable reit subsidiary which can provide a limited amount of services to tenants and other customers of the reit even if such services were not considered customarily furnished in connection with the rental of real property and can manage or operate properties  generally for third parties  without causing the rents received by the reit from such parties not to be treated as rent from real properties 
a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to regular federal income tax  and state and local income tax where applicable  as a regular c corporation 
the value of the securities of all taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed of the total value of the reit s assets 
in addition  interest paid by a taxable reit subsidiary to the related reit is subject to the earnings stripping rules contained in section j of the code and  therefore  the taxable reit subsidiary cannot deduct interest in any year that would exceed of the subsidiary s adjusted gross income 
if any amount of interest  rent  or other deductions of the taxable reit subsidiary to be paid to the reit is determined not to be at arm s length  an excise tax of is imposed on the portion that is redetermined to be excessive 
however  rent received by a reit will not fail to qualify as rents from real property by reason of the fact that all or any portion of such rent is redetermined for purposes of the excise tax

the company will consolidate jdn development s operations in its financial statements effective with the first reporting period in distribution requirements in order to continue to maintain its qualification as a reit  a reit is required to distribute annually of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gain 
this required distribution is reduced from to effective for taxable years beginning after december  the secured credit agreements restrict the company s ability to pay cash distributions 
rents from personal property a reit may treat rent from personal property as rent from real property so long as the rent from personal property does not exceed of the total rent from both real and personal property for the taxable year 
this determination will now be made by comparing the fair market value of the personal property to the fair market value of the real and personal property 
inflation the company s leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling the company to pass through to tenants certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
certain of the company s leases contain clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the company s non anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increased rents upon re leasing at higher market rates
