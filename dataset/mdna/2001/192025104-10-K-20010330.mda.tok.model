the management discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the annual report to stockholders is incorporated by reference in response to this item and is included on pages through of exhibit item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information appearing in the annual report to stockholders  under the caption market risk management included in management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations  is incorporated by reference in response to this item and is included on pages and of exhibit codorus valley manages interest rate risk primarily through sensitivity analysis  included on pages and of exhibit it also uses a gap analysis as a secondary means for managing interest rate risk 
the gap analysis begins by assigning interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities into future time periods  typically one year  based on a scheduled maturity or repricing date 
repriceable liabilities are then subtracted from repriceable assets to determine a difference  or gap 
the measurement process relies on many assumptions such as the amount and timing of repriceable cash flows from interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the following assumptions are made about repriceable cash flows from interest rate sensitive assets o variable rate instruments could reprice daily  o adjustable rate instruments reprice at the interest maturity date  o fixed rate loans reprice at their scheduled maturity date and include estimated prepayments o fixed rate investment securities  except for mortgage backed instruments  reprice at their scheduled maturity date  or call date if more appropriate  and o fixed rate mortgage backed instruments reprice based on principal paydown estimates 
generally  the cash flow assumptions for interest sensitive assets apply to interest sensitive liabilities with the exception of now and savings deposits which do not have scheduled maturities 
technically  now and savings balances can be repriced at any time 
historically  now and savings balances and rates have been relatively stable despite changes in market interest rates 
this stability assumption was made in the current measurement process 
a schedule depicting balance sheet repricing characteristics and an estimate of gap at december   is provided below 
the cumulative gap measure is one way to measure how a change in market interest rates will impact net interest income for specific time frames 
for example  the cumulative gap in the repricing category represents a one year net liability position of million or percent of interest earning assets on december  the liability sensitive gap position implies that over the next year net income will increase if market interest rates fall and decrease if rates rise 
the theory is that more liabilities will reprice  at lower market interest rates  than the assets that they fund 
a gap analysis is limited in its usefulness since it represents a one day position  which is continually changing and not necessarily indicative of codorus valley s position at any other time 
gap analysis does not consider the complexity of interest rate relationships and spreads depending on the direction  magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates 
additionally  it does not consider the impact of financial strategies that management could employ
