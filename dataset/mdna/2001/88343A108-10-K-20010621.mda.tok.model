item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a worldwide leader in the development  manufacture  marketing and service of process control metrology systems for use in the manufacture of semiconductors 
process control metrology is used to monitor process parameters in order to enable semiconductor manufacturers to reduce feature size  increase wafer size  increase equipment productivity and improve device performance 
our current process control metrology systems are principally used to measure ion implantation and thin film deposition and removal 
we currently sell five product families of process control metrology systems therma probe systems  opti probe systems  opti probe cd systems  meta probe systems and integra systems 
therma probe product family 
therma probe systems utilize our proprietary thermal wave technology and are the predominant non destructive process control metrology systems used to measure the critical ion implantation process on product wafers in the fabrication of semiconductors 
opti probe product family 
opti probe systems significantly improve upon existing thin film metrology systems by successfully integrating different measurement technologies and utilizing our proprietary optical technologies 
opti probe cd product family 
opti probe cd systems are spectroscopic ellipsometer based systems that provide revolutionary  nondestructive critical dimension cd metrology for the smallest features of the next generations of ic s 
meta probe product family 
meta probe thin film measurement systems utilize a patented technique based on x ray reflectometry to rapidly measure thickness  density  and roughness of each film in multi layer stacks 
integra product family 
integra line of integrated metrology products is a broad based family of compact metrology modules which will be installed and function inside an ic process system  such as an etcher or cvd deposition system  to provide metrology on each wafer before it exits the process tool 
in fiscal  we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue from replacement and spare parts is generally recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue on service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract 
revenue for system sales is recognized under a multi element arrangement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our revenue recognition policy 
we derive our revenues from system sales  sales of replacement and spare parts  and service contracts 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from system sales  from sales of replacement and spare parts  including associated labor  and from service contracts 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from system sales  from sales of replacement and spare parts  including associated labor  and from service contracts 
during the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from system sales  from sales of replacement and spare parts  including associated labor  and from service contracts 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
a substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
although we have not been negatively impacted in the past by foreign currency changes in japan  korea  taiwan and europe  such conditions could negatively impact our international sales in future periods 
on february   we completed an initial public offering of common stock 
in connection with this offering and the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs  were million 
during the early part of march  we used approximately million of net proceeds to redeem or repurchase substantially all of our outstanding senior notes issued during recapitalization in  including accrued interest  redemption premiums and related expenses 
we also used million of net proceeds to buy out the seven and one half years remaining in the term of a consulting agreement with bain capital  inc remaining cash proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
on march   we called for redemption of all outstanding shares of preferred stock 
on march  and march   respectively   and  shares of preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
results of operations the following table summarizes our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated

net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
fiscal results reflected our adoption of sab prior periods have not been restated for sab under sab  a portion of revenues are deferred until installation is complete and the customer accepts the system 
deferred revenue relative to service contracts is recognized over of the life of the related service contract 
compared to fiscal  net revenues increased million or 
the increase in fiscal revenues was primarily attributable to the improved conditions experienced in the semiconductor capital equipment industry during fiscal  which were primarily related to the growth of semiconductor manufacturers and the recovery of economic conditions in the asia pacific region 
revenues increased primarily due to increased units sold of both our therma probe and opti probe products 
revenue from spare parts and service contracts has also increased as our customer base continues to expand 
during fiscal year  we received record orders for both our mm and mm product lines which resulted in the increased revenue and backlog 
the mm product lines continued to grow as a percentage of our product mix 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and of our total revenues for such periods  respectively 
due to significant demand from customers in taiwan and stronger economic conditions in the asia pacific region  sales to customers in asia represented approximately and of total net revenues for the years ended march  and  respectively 
we believe that demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may currently be experiencing a cyclical downturn 
as a result  we may expect lower order booking rates in the near future  relative to those achieved in fiscal fewer orders  combined with rescheduling of delivery  would result in lower net revenue and gross profit that would materially adversely impact our financial positions and results of operations 
although we had a strong backlog as of march   we presently expect that net revenues for the quarter ended june  will be lower than net revenues in the comparable period in fiscal the anticipated timing of shipments and customer acceptances of those orders will require us to fill a number of production slots in order to meet our near term sales targets 
additionally  we are currently experiencing an increased level of customer cancellation and rescheduling of deliveries 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to secure existing production orders  our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted in the near term 
however  due to changes in customer delivery dates and uncertainty as to customer acceptance  we can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current or prior sales level 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher revenue levels 
under sab  we were required to defer a significant portion of our system revenues upon installation and customer acceptance of the systems  but we are not allowed to defer any of the manufacturing cost of those tools 
if revenues and costs had been recorded under our previous methods of accounting for revenue recognition  fiscal gross margin would have been approximately 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase in fiscal of million  or from fiscal r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the increase of absolute dollars from the prior year is primarily the result of additional resources dedicated to the development of new products 
we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and expect to continue to commit significant resources to r d projects 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
compared to the corresponding period of fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal increased million  or 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to higher revenue levels 
the increase in fiscal sg a expenses was due primarily to increased headcount as well as increase in sales expenses related to increased revenues 
severance charge 
a million one time severance charge was accrued in fiscal due to the retirement of our former chairman and cto  allan rosenwaig 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from the prior fiscal year is attributable to the redemption or repurchase of substantially all of our outstanding senior notes in march other income expense 
other income  net for fiscal was million  compared to million net other expense in fiscal interest income generated from our cash balance and short term investment was offset by the million one time charge in the fourth fiscal quarter related to the settlement of patent lawsuits between therma wave  inc and kla tencor 
provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded a million provision for income taxes 
we did not record any tax provision or benefit in fiscal because we could not conclude that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be fully realizable and had provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
based upon our current evaluation of our loss carry forward potential and research and development tax credit carry forward benefits  we believe our effective tax rate for the fiscal should be approximately 
net income loss 
net income for fiscal was million  as compared to a million loss for the prior fiscal year 
this improvement in fiscal was primarily a result of improved revenue  margin and decreased interest expense 
excluding extraordinary and one time charges  net income for fiscal and would have been million and  respectively 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
compared to the corresponding period of fiscal  net revenues increased million or 
the increase in revenue is the result of the improvement in the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which is primarily related to the growth of semiconductor manufacturers and the recovery of economic conditions in the asia pacific region 
revenues have increased primarily due to increased unit sales and average selling prices of both our therma probe and opti probe products 
revenue from spare parts and service contracts have also increased as our customer base continues to expand 
new orders for fiscal year were up substantially from the prior year and resulted in a strengthened backlog 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and of our total revenues for such periods  respectively 
due to significant demand from customers in taiwan and stronger economic conditions in the asia pacific region  sales to customers in asia represented approximately and of total net revenues for the year ended march  and  respectively 
historically  we have experienced volatility from asian markets 
although we have recently experienced increased sales and received an increased level of orders from customers in the asia pacific region  turbulance in the asian markets could adversely affect our sales in the future 
gross margin 
gross margin increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin is due to higher revenue levels and favorable sales mix 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
compared to the corresponding period of fiscal  r d expenses increased million  or for fiscal r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the increase of absolute dollars from the prior year is primarily the result of additional resources dedicated to new products expected to be released in the next year 
we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and expect to continue to commit significant resources to r d projects 
in the near term  we expect our r d expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
compared to the corresponding period of fiscal  sg a expenses increased million  or 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to higher revenue levels 
the increase in sg a expenses was due primarily to the increase in sales expenses related to increased revenues 
expenses relating to operating cost improvements 
on june and september   we announced and implemented an operating cost improvement program aimed at bringing operating expenses in line with our current operating environment 
all terminated employees were notified at the time the program was announced 
leased facilities in texas  arizona and osaka  japan were closed  and fixed assets were consolidated 
total cash outlays for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
non cash charges of  in fiscal were primarily for asset write offs 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of net revenues  interest expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in interest expense from the prior fiscal year is attributable to the redemption or repurchase of substantially all of our outstanding senior notes in march other income expense 
other expenses  net for fiscal was million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  there was a one time charge of million related to the buy out of the seven and one half years remaining in the term of a consulting agreement with bain capital 
provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million 
our tax benefit for fiscal reflects a tax benefit rate of based upon our loss carryback potential 
for fiscal  we have not recorded any tax benefit because we believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable and have provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
net loss 
net loss for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal excluding extraordinary and one time charges  net income for fiscal would have been  also  in march  all outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into an equal number of shares of common stock  increasing the income available to common stockholders beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal dividends accrued for preferred stockholders totaled million in fiscal backlog at march   and  our backlogs were million  million  and million respectively 
effective april   our backlog consists of product orders for which a customer purchase order has been received and accepted and which are scheduled for shipment within twelve months 
orders that are scheduled for shipment beyond the twelve month window are not included in backlog until they fall within the twelve month window 
orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer  usually without penalty 
backlog also includes recurring fees payable under support contracts with our customers and orders for spare parts and billable service 
because of possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders and because our sales will sometimes reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that they are received  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  consisting primarily of accounts receivable and inventories 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of our systems  our inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
since the recapitalization  we have funded our operating activities principally from funds generated from operations  tax refunds and net proceeds from our initial public offering 
cash flow provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
excluding extraordinary charges and non recurring charges  cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended march  would have been million 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to is primarily due to the increase of revenue level 
the decrease in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal to is mainly due to the increased investment in working capital and the termination of the bain capital consulting agreement 
during the year ended march   net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million and a net increase in short term investments of million 
purchases of property and equipment were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal included approximately million for expansion of our clean room at our fremont  california manufacturing facility and million for leasehold improvements to our new sales  marketing and customer support facility in fremont 
cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended march   most of which represented proceeds received during the year to exercise stock options and purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we announced on april  the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices 
we intend to finance the repurchase of our common stock from our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in may  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes that  together with a million equity contribution  was used to finance the recapitalization 
in the recapitalization  we used million to repay outstanding borrowings  million to redeem a portion of our common stock  million to pay related fees and expenses and million for general working capital purposes 
in conjunction with the recapitalization  we entered into a senior credit facility with various lending institutions  and bankers trust company  as agent 
the bank credit facility bears interest  at our option  at the base rate plus or the eurodollar rate plus 
our borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  a pledge of all of the capital stock of any domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of of the capital stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries 
the bank credit facility matures on may  during the quarter ended june   we amended the bank credit facility to have our borrowing availability subject to a borrowing base formula  which provided a maximum revolving credit facility of million  and to adjust the financial covenants requiring us to maintain minimum levels of ebitda during each six month period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter and minimum levels of cumulative ebitda from april  to the last day of each fiscal quarter 
in august  we entered into a second amendment to our bank credit facility to further adjust these financial tests 
the second amendment also provided that if we had not consummated a qualified initial public offering by the end of december   then the loan commitment amount would be reduced by million to million 
in march  we entered into a third amendment to permit the redemption and conversion of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock into common stock 
these amendments were effected in light of the impact of the downturn in the semiconductor industry on our operating results 
without the first amendment to our bank credit facility  on june   we would have violated the financial test relating to the maintenance of minimum levels of ebitda for the six month period ending on that date 
we may borrow amounts under the amended bank credit facility to finance our working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
the amended bank credit facility requires us to meet financial tests and contains covenants customary for this type of financing 
at march   there was million outstanding under a letter of credit and million of unused borrowing capacity under the amended bank credit facility 
in june  we replaced our bankers trust bank credit facility and the million outstanding letter of credit with a new million loan and security agreement and a million letter of credit with comerica bank 
the new bank credit facility allows us to borrow money bearing interest either at a floating rate per annum equal to the prime rate or at a rate per annum equal to libor plus 
we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed million minus the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit  including any drawn but unreimbursed letters of credit 
our borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the comerica bank credit facility matures on march  on february   we completed an initial public offering of common stock 
in connection with this offering and the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs  were million 
during the early part of march  we used approximately million of net proceeds to redeem or repurchase substantially all of the outstanding senior notes  including accrued interest  redemption premiums and related expenses 
we also used million of net proceeds to buy out of the seven and one half years remaining in the term of a consulting agreement with bain capital 
remaining cash proceeds have been used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
our principal sources of funds following the offering have been and are anticipated to be cash and short term investments on hand million as of march   cash flows from operating activities and  if necessary  borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
we believe that these funds will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources for us to meet our current and future financial obligations 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or to fund our research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for the fiscal years ended march   and recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement on financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet at their fair market value  and the corresponding derivative gains or losses be either reported on the statement of operations or as a deferred item depending on the type of hedge relationship that exists with respect to such derivative 
we currently do not hold any derivative instruments that are affected by the adoption of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of march   our cash included money market securities and commercial paper 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
