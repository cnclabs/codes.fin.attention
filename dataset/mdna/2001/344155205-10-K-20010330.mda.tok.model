item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
we provide voice  data and internet infrastructure services to large  communications intensive users in major cities 
we began operations in and initiated service first in chicago in may as of december  we offered service in a total of markets  which encompass a total of metropolitan statistical areas  or msas  and plan to serve markets  or msas  by the end of we believe our market expansion will allow us to reach a critical mass of geographic coverage and service capability for our target customer base of communications intensive users 
as of december   we had  lines in service 
in september  we announced the launch of our first focal internet exchange platform in our chicago market 
our state of the art internet exchange platforms provide high speed  managed internet access  colocation  and private peering services to large corporations  value added resellers  network service providers  and content and application service providers 
during the fourth quarter of  we deployed focal internet exchanges in seven additional markets new york  northern new jersey  philadelphia  washington dc  san francisco  oakland and san jose 
at the end of  our focal internet exchanges served eight markets 
we intend to deploy a total of focal internet exchanges across our planned markets 
revenue 
data services revenue includes revenues from circuit switched lines sold to network service providers  dsl  colocation  and internet infrastructure services 
telecom services revenue includes circuit switched lines sold to corporate and var customers 
our data and telecom services revenue is composed of monthly recurring charges  usage charges  and initial non recurring charges 
monthly recurring charges include the fees paid by our customers for lines in service  additional features on those lines  and colocation space 
monthly recurring charges are derived only from end user customers 
usage charges consist of fees paid by end users for each call made  fees paid by the ilec and other clecs as reciprocal compensation  and access charges paid by the ixcs for long distance traffic that we originate and terminate 
non recurring revenues are typically derived from fees charged to install new customer lines and are deferred and amortized over estimated customer lives 
we earn reciprocal compensation revenue for calls made by customers of another local exchange carrier to our customers 
conversely  we incur reciprocal compensation expense to other local exchange carriers for calls by our customers to their customers 
we expect the proportion of revenues represented by reciprocal compensation to decrease in the future as a result of the expiration and subsequent renegotiation of our existing interconnection agreements with the ilecs and the impact of recent and future regulatory developments 
expenses 
our expenses are categorized as network expenses  selling  general and administrative  depreciation and amortization  and non cash compensation expense 
network expenses are composed of leased transport charges  the cost of leasing space in ilec central offices for colocating our transmission equipment  the costs of leasing our nationwide internet network  reciprocal compensation payments and the cost of completing local and long distance calls 
leased transport charges are the lease payments we make for the use of fiber transport facilities connecting our customers to our switches and for our connection to the ilecs and other clecs networks 
generally  we have been successful in negotiating lease agreements that match the duration of our customer contracts  thereby allowing us to avoid the risk of incurring expenses associated with transport facilities that are not being used by revenue generating customers 
our strategy of initially leasing rather than building our own fiber transport facilities has resulted in our cost of service being a significant component of total cost 
accordingly  our network expenses may be higher on a relative basis compared to clecs who own a higher percentage of their transport network 
however  compared to these same companies  our capital expenditures will be significantly lower 
a key aspect of our smart build strategy is that we only operate in tier markets which are served by multiple fiber providers 
when traffic volumes grow sufficiently to justify investing in our own network  we have purchased our own fiber 
as of december  we were operating our own fiber networks in nine of our markets with approximately  fiber miles in operation 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a consists of network and customer care personnel costs  sales force compensation and promotional expenses as well as the cost of corporate activities related to regulatory  finance  human resources  legal  executive  and other administrative activities 
we expect our sales expense to be lower as a percentage of revenue than that of our competitors because we have relatively high sales productivity associated with our strategy of serving communications intensive customers 
these customers generally utilize a large number of switched access lines relative to the average business customer  resulting in more revenue per sale 
further  fewer sales representatives are required to service the relatively smaller number of communications intensive customers in a given region 
we record monthly non cash compensation expense related to shares issued to some of our executive officers in november  in connection with the september  amendments to vesting agreements with some of our executive officers  in connection with stock options granted to employees  an outside consultant  and directors during and shares issued to a director during the first quarter of we will continue to record non cash compensation expense in future periods relating to these events through the third quarter of see the notes to our consolidated financial statements

year ended december  compared to year ended december  our data services revenue increased for the year ended december  to million 
telecom services revenue increased to million for the year ended december  the increase in our data and telecom services revenue is primarily due to the generation of revenues from new markets that went into operation during and from a sequential increase in revenue from our more mature markets 
in addition  we installed  lines during  which exceeded the lines installed during the comparable period of by approximately or  lines 
network expenses totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase resulted from our expansion into new markets during and related costs for leased transport facilities  usage settlements  colocation and internet network costs related to our focal internet exchange platforms 
our gross margin was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease in our gross margin is a direct result of our market expansion  our effective reciprocal compensation per minute of use rate having declined between periods and due to initial network costs related to our focal internet exchange platforms 
sg a expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  this increase is the result of our expansion into new markets  the rollout of our focal internet exchange platforms  and due to a corresponding increase in our employee base by employees 
depreciation and amortization increased from million to million in the comparative year to year periods 
this million increase is a result of our expansion into new markets  an increase in our fixed asset base for our existing markets  and due to the build out of our nationwide network and focal internet exchange platforms 
interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this million increase is primarily due to the receipt of million in net proceeds from our senior notes notes offering completed in january our net interest expense increased from million during to million for this net increase of million is primarily due to an additional million of interest expense charged relating to our outstanding notes which was partially offset by interest capitalized during the year ended december  totaling million 
we incurred us income tax expense of million for compared to a tax benefit of million in the tax benefit recorded for is the result of a net operating loss carryback for a refund of federal and state taxes paid 
our six most established markets had million in revenue  ebitda of million  and an ebitda margin of during we provide market specific information to provide insight into the life cycle performance of our older markets which are comprised of chicago  new york  san francisco  san jose  oakland  and philadelphia 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total revenue for the year ended was million compared to million for the year ended this increase of is primarily due to the generation of revenue from numerous markets during compared to revenues from primarily two markets  chicago and new york  in the comparable period of we installed approximately  access lines during  which exceeded the lines installed in the comparable period of by approximately or  lines 
network expenses totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase resulted from our rapid expansion into six new markets and related costs for leased transport facilities and usage settlements 
our gross margin was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease in our gross margin is a direct result of our effective reciprocal compensation per minute of use rate having declined between periods 
sg a expenses increased by million to million during the year ended december  this increase is the result of our planned expansion and due to a corresponding increase in our employee base by employees 
depreciation and amortization increased from million to million in the comparative year to year periods 
this increase of million is a result of our expansion into six new markets and due to our fixed asset base increase for our existing markets 
our capital expenditures of approximately million excluding million of assets acquired under capital lease were million greater than that of the comparable period of non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for comparable period in this million increase in non cash compensation expense is the result of september  amendments of vesting agreements with some of our executive officers  stock options granted to employees  an outside consultant  and directors during  and stock issued to a director during the first quarter of interest income was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
this increase of million is primarily due to our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increasing from million at the end of to million at the end of this increase is the result of our net proceeds of approximately million raised in our august initial public offering 
interest expense increased from million during to million for this net increase of million is due to an additional million of amortization of our outstanding senior discount notes  million of interest expense on our secured equipment term loan  and million of non cash interest expense relating to our capital lease obligation for dark fiber transport capacity 
this increase of million was partially offset by approximately million of interest capitalized during in connection with the construction of our major facilities and networks 
we incurred us income tax expense of million for the year ended compared to million in the same period of this decrease of million in our tax expense between years is primarily due to the million of additional pre tax losses incurred during and the realization of a net operating loss at the end of we are obligated to pay federal and state income taxes due to the application of the alternative minimum tax 
liquidity and capital resources our current business plan anticipates that we expand our existing networks and services  expand into four new markets in  deploy our own fiber capacity in a majority of our markets  construct focal internet exchange platforms across our planned markets  construct expanded colocation centers  and fund operating losses 
we will require significant capital to fund this plan including the purchase and installation of voice and data switches  routers  equipment  infrastructure and fiber facilities and or long term rights to use fiber transport capacity 
the implementation of this plan requires significant capital expenditures  a substantial portion of which will be incurred before significant related revenues from our new markets are expected to be realized 
these expenditures  together with associated operating expenses  may result in our having substantial negative operating cash flow and substantial net operating losses for the foreseeable future  including our current plan indicates we will turn ebitda positive during in addition  our cash on hand and funds available under our credit facility see below provides over million in liquidity as of december  although we believe that our current plan  cost estimates and the scope and timing of our planned network build out are reasonable  we cannot assure that actual costs or the timing of the expenditures  or that the scope and timing of our build out  will be consistent with current estimates 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in compared to million in excluding million of assets acquired under capital lease 
this increase of million primarily reflects capital spending for the build out of our new and existing markets and for the construction of our nationwide network and focal internet exchange platforms 
we estimate that our capital expenditures in connection with our current business plan will be approximately million to million during the capital expenditures are expected to be made primarily for the build out of four additional markets  the construction of focal internet exchange platforms  the expansion of our existing markets and the activation of local dark fiber transport capacity in a number of our markets 
our expectations of future capital requirements and cash flows from operations are based on current estimates 
if our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital or seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million  an increase of million from the same period in this increase is primarily the result of a million increase in depreciation and amortization  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and an additional million of amortization of our senior discount notes  which was offset by additional net losses of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million  a decrease of million from the same period in this decrease is primarily the result of a million increase in depreciation and amortization  a million increase in non cash compensation expense  and an additional million of amortization of our senior discount notes  which was offset by additional net losses of million and the increase in our accounts receivable exceeded by approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for compared to million in this increase of million is primarily the result of our expansion into four new markets and the continued expansion of our existing markets 
our capital expenditures of million in exceeded by million 
short term investments primarily consist of debt securities  which typically mature between three months and one year 
net cash used in investing activities was million for compared to million in this increase of million is primarily the result of our expansion into six new markets and the continued expansion of our existing markets 
our capital expenditures of million in exceeded by million 
short term investments primarily consist of debt securities  which typically mature between three months and one year 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  an increase of million from this increase is primarily the net result of our proceeds from the issuance of our notes in january net cash provided by financing activities for was million  a decrease of million from this decrease is primarily the net result of our debt and equity proceeds between comparable periods 
on february   we received million in gross proceeds from the sale of our notes 
the notes will accrete to an aggregate stated principal amount of million by february  as of december   the principal amount of the notes had accreted to approximately million 
no interest is payable on the notes prior to august  thereafter  cash interest will be payable semiannually on august and february of each year 
on august   we raised net proceeds of approximately million in our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which includes the underwriter s exercise of their over allotment option to purchase  common shares at per share 
on january   we received approximately million in net proceeds from our notes offering completed in january our secured equipment term loans are solely for the purchase of telecommunications equipment and related software licenses and must be repaid over a five year period from the date of the borrowing 
as of december   there are no borrowings available to us under this facility and we had million outstanding under this term loan facility 
on august   we completed our million senior secured credit facility the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a seven year million revolving credit facility and a seven year million delayed draw term loan facility 
the credit facility will be available  subject to certain financial and operating terms and conditions  and is intended to provide purchase money financing for the construction  acquisition  or improvements of telecommunications assets 
the interest on amounts drawn is variable based on our leverage ratio  as defined in our credit facility 
the initial commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility is and will step down based on usage 
we had not drawn down against the credit facility as of december  during february  we borrowed approximately million under the credit facility 
we have historically incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of million and million as of december  and respectively 
the aggregate net proceeds totaling approximately million that we received from the offering of our notes  the august equity offering  the notes and certain other financings  have funded a large portion of our operating losses and capital expenditures through december  we expect that our existing cash and investment balances  a portion of our credit facility  flexible smart build success based operating plans  and future cash flows expected to be provided from ongoing operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of our expectations of future capital requirements and cash flows from operations are based on current estimates 
if plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital  seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated  or modify our expansion plans 
the discussions under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ substantially from our projections 
see information regarding forward looking statements on page of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio  which primarily consists of debt securities  typically maturing within one year  and entering into long term debt obligations with appropriate pricing and terms 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
financial instruments held for other than trading purposes do not impose a material market risk on us 
we are exposed to interest rate risk  as additional debt financing is periodically needed due to the large operating losses and capital expenditures associated with establishing and expanding our network coverage 
the interest rate that we will be able to obtain on debt financing will depend on market conditions at that time  and may differ from the rates we have secured on our current debt 
while all of focal s long term debt bears fixed interest rates  the fair market value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we have no cash flow or earnings exposure due to market interest rate changes for our fixed long term debt obligations
