item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates 
the company has significant operations in norway  and therefore  is exposed to currency rate risk 
for the company  a weakening of the norwegian kroner relative to the us dollar has a positive effect on the cost of operating in norway but has a negative foreign currency translation effect 
the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar is not hedged 
the net assets in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates were approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  any loss in fair value would be reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and would not reduce reported net income of the company 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we mitigate our risk by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included marketable debt securities of million and equity securities of million 
these debt securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if the interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or the results of operations 
the company is exposed to changes in exchange rates through the purchase of production materials and the sale of products denominated in foreign currencies 
the company limits its exposure by engaging in forward exchange contracts 
at december   the company had contracts totaling million at a rate of euro  which became due in january unrealized profit loss  which were insignificant at december   on forward contracts in foreign currencies were valued on the basis of the market exchange rate at the end of the year
