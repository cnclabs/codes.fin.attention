the company conducts funeral service operations in all countries and cemetery operations in north america  south america  australia and certain countries within europe 
as of december   the company s largest markets were north america and france  which when combined  represent approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  of consolidated income from operations before non recurring items and of the company s total operating locations 
the funeral and cemetery operations are organized with a north america division covering the united states and canada  a european division responsible for all operations in europe and other international operations managed in the pacific rim and south america 
during  the company reorganized leadership of its european operations to focus on stabilizing the company s market share in its european markets 
the majority of the company s operations throughout the world are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are geographical groups of funeral service locations and cemeteries that lower their individual overhead costs by sharing common resources such as operating personnel  preparation services  clerical staff  limousines  hearses and preneed sales personnel 
personnel costs  the largest of the operating expenses for the company  are the cost components most beneficially affected by clustering 
the sharing of employees  as well as the other costs mentioned  allow the company to more efficiently utilize its operating facilities 
in the first quarter of  the company began the process of implementing central processing centers throughout north america in order to further assist in the efficiencies of accounting and back office functions 
once implementation is complete  which is expected in  these central processing centers will take further advantage of this clustering concept in order to reduce personnel costs 
the funeral service locations and cemetery operations consist of the company s funeral homes  cemeteries  crematoria and related businesses 
both funeral service locations and cemeteries can contain crematoria facilities 
the company has approximately combination facilities in which a funeral service location is contained within a cemetery 
the other services operations consist of the company s lending subsidiary  which previously provided capital financing for independent funeral and cemetery operations 
in  the company decided to indefinitely suspend the operations of its lending subsidiary 
on august   the company sold a substantial portion of the loan portfolio of its lending subsidiary 
the operations of the lending subsidiary through august  have been included herein as other services

the company has entered into marketing agreements with the purchasers  which became effective at the closing of the transactions and are expected to produce more free cash flow for the company over the next several years than if the insurance operations were owned by the company 
the marketing agreements with both the united states and french insurance companies are also expected to provide enhanced opportunities to sell prearranged funerals in the company s worldwide funeral markets 
strategic initiatives historically  the company s growth has been largely attributable to acquiring funeral and cemetery businesses which resulted in creating the world s largest network of funeral service locations and cemeteries 
the company believes this network forms the foundation of its growth initiatives going forward 
during the mid s  the market to acquire funeral service locations and cemeteries became extremely competitive which resulted in increased acquisition prices and substantially reduced returns on invested capital 
in early  the company announced plans to significantly reduce the level of its acquisition activity and pursue other means to create meaningful growth from its existing operations 
as a result  the company s strategic plan in was focused on reducing overhead costs  increasing cash flow and reducing debt while at the same time developing key revenue initiatives designed to drive future internal growth in the company s core funeral and cemetery operations without the outlay of significant capital 
management s current bonus compensation plan is aligned with the execution of these elements of its strategic plan 
overhead costs the company s overhead costs include corporate general and administrative costs  regional field overhead costs and other home office costs related to functions directly supporting field operations 
as a result of the company s focus on overhead reduction  total overhead costs for the full year of decreased approximately compared to the full year of  excluding overhead costs associated with the company s trust administration functions 
the company received substantial non recurring receipts in from the collection of amounts due to the company from funeral and cemetery trust funds 
to accomplish the receipt of these funds  as well as to continue to provide normal trust administration activities  the company incurred approximately  more costs in related to its trust administration functions compared to in the first quarter of  the company outsourced its trust administration functions to kpmg llp which is expected to reduce future cash overhead costs while at the same time continuing the timely collection of amounts due to the company from funeral and cemetery trust funds 
operating free cash flow the company s strategic plan in included the execution of several cash flow initiatives that were designed to increase the company s operating free cash flow 
the company considers operating free cash flow to be cash funds that can generally be used to reduce the company s debt and is defined more specifically in the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s total operating free cash flow for the year ended december  was  at the upper end of the company s expected range of  to  a summary of the company s operating free cash flow is shown below 
operating free improvement in cash flow over run rate targets total operating free cash flow     recurring operating free cash flow     the company has improved total operating free cash flow by  primarily through the reduction of capital expenditures to maintenance levels and the suspension of the company s quarterly cash dividend 
the company also executed several other cash initiatives in including the efficient retrieval of funds due to the company from certain funeral and cemetery trusts  the realignment of preneed cemetery and prearranged funeral sales structures to become more cash flow positive and the suspension of the company s acquisition program 
the company expects its total operating free cash flow including non recurring receipts of funds to be between the run rate targets of  to  by the end of through march   the company had already received approximately  of non recurring receipts of funds from certain income tax refunds and from the collection of receivables from funeral and cemetery trust funds 
included in the company s total operating free cash flow are receipts of funds that are of a non recurring nature totaling  for the full year of and  for the full year of these funds relate to the collection of receivables due to the company from funeral and cemetery trust funds 
excluding these non recurring receipts of funds  the company s recurring operating free cash flow was  in and a use of  in the company continues to implement existing and additional initiatives in to increase its recurring operating free cash flow from levels 
these cash flow initiatives are categorized as revenue growth initiatives  working capital improvements  cost reduction initiatives  asset redeployment and enhanced funeral and cemetery trust administration and management 
revenue initiatives include such programs as the company s dignity memorial tm packaged funeral plans and the development of affinity relationships 
these initiatives are discussed in further detail in the section revenue growth initiatives included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
working capital improvements include programs to accelerate customer collections and deliver pre sold merchandise to customers to satisfy trusting requirements 
cost reduction initiatives include changes to the company s employee benefit plans and other overhead reductions primarily related to information technology costs 
the company s recurring operating free cash flow is also expected to increase related to assets being redeployed and managed more efficiently such as cash override payments that will be received as a result of marketing agreements entered in connection with the sale of its insurance subsidiaries and interest savings as a result of proceeds received from divestitures completed in and from proceeds to be received from the sale of certain north america funeral and cemetery operations announced in january enhanced cemetery and funeral trust administration and management will allow the company to increase operating free cash flow by reducing processing times for trust claims and accelerate trust distributions as well as the continuation of the company s surety bond program for additional financial assurance discussed in the financial assurances section in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in this form k 
the company is currently in various stages of executing the above cash flow initiatives and  along with other cash flow initiatives currently under development  expects these initiatives to increase the company s operating free cash flow from  in to a run rate between  to  by the end of and to a run rate between  to  by the end of long term debt the company s total debt at december  was  which was slightly below the company s anticipated range of  to  the company s total debt balances are detailed below 
peak debt at september   debt at december   debt at december   target debt range at december   the company s debt reduction programs over the past fifteen months have exceeded its expectations with its total debt being reduced by over  or from the company s peak debt level at september  the company has achieved this reduction of debt primarily through funds received from its total operating free cash flow and the sale of certain assets and non core businesses 
in  the company completed the sale of certain loans of its lending subsidiary  the termination or assignment away of certain financial swap agreements  the sale of its discontinued insurance operations and various other asset sales 
these transactions produced after tax cash proceeds of  in and  coupled with total operating free cash flow in were the primary factors that allowed the company to reduce its debt below its anticipated range of  to  by the end of the company is continuing to sell certain non strategic funeral and cemetery operations in north america in that are not well aligned with the company s long term strategy 
the company will also continue discussions with various parties concerning the possibility of joint venturing primarily its international operations 
alliances and joint ventures with strategic partners could include groups that offer unique competitive advantages not previously available to the company  such as access to customer databases  marketing services and prearrangement financing 
proceeds from any investments made by strategic partners would be used by the company to reduce its debt 
with substantial non recurring receipt of funds expected in  improvements in recurring operating free cash flow described earlier  proceeds expected from sales of certain non strategic funeral and cemetery operations in north america and proceeds from joint venture programs primarily with the company s international operations  the company anticipates reducing its debt from the current level of  to a range of  to  by the end of revenue growth initiatives the company has the largest network of funeral homes and cemeteries in the world 
the company has unique opportunities to leverage this network by adding new products and services  attracting new customers to its existing facilities and to aggressively expand its current market share in its funeral and cemetery markets 
the company plans to expand its market share and generate future revenue growth through the execution of several initiatives without the outlay of significant additional capital 
six of the company s most important revenue growth initiatives primarily being implemented in north america are listed below 
creation of a seamless  national brand of funeral service locations under the dignity memorial tm brand name 
implementation of dignity memorial tm funeral packages 
establishment of exclusive  national  branded affinity relationships with employers  social  fraternal and charitable groups or institutions 
improvement of standards in customer service 
continued commitment to funeral and cemetery prearrangement 
expansion of cremation marketing  merchandising and services 
the development of the dignity memorial tm brand name is a unique opportunity that the company believes only it can pursue because of it size and geographic diversity and creates the first national brand in the death care industry for funeral service locations that will be recognized and portable on a national basis 
a national network with national portability of products and services is important to the company s current and prospective affinity partners 
the dignity memorial tm provider network will also be developed through an affiliate program by offering non sci funeral service locations  primarily in markets where the company does not currently have coverage  the opportunity to join the dignity memorial tm provider network and have access to the dignity memorial tm branded products and services  prearranged funeral funding services  merchandising expertise and internet capabilities 
the company is also in the process of implementing dignity memorial tm branded funeral packages in north america which will be completed in the dignity memorial tm funeral packages are designed to simplify customer decision making and include new products and services which have traditionally not been available through funeral service locations 
examples of these new products and services include legal services  estate organizing and planning  grief counseling and virtual family archiving services on the internet 
these new products and services are designed to increase customer satisfaction while also increasing funeral operating revenues and profitability 
the company is continuing its efforts to execute agreements with affinity partners on national  regional and local levels which provide exclusive  direct access through mail or other agreed upon media to large groups of individuals who meet the company s ideal customer profile 
the company then tailors funeral plans to suit the affinity partner s membership requirements 
as an example  the company has begun implementation of specialized funeral plans through an affinity relationship with the veterans of foreign wars vfw and the vfw ladies auxiliary in  which includes vfw and branch of service logos  unique flag and medal cases and specified services requested for vfw members 
beginning in and completed in  the company implemented comprehensive continuous customer surveys to provide valuable feedback from consumers in order to enhance customer service and provide insight into consumer preferences for additional products and services on a global basis 
the company received responses from of all families serviced in in north america funeral service locations which indicated a high approval rating 
the company also remains committed to prearrangement programs with consumers for funeral and cemetery products and services  which the company believes can increase future market share in its funeral service and cemetery markets 
at december   the company had deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues of  which will be recognized as revenues in future periods 
see note six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of preneed cemetery sales activities 
during  the company restructured its prearranged organization and compensation plans to improve the cash flows from the company s prearrangement activities 
in addition to funding approximately of prearranged funeral contracts through insurance sources creating general agency revenue and cash overrides  the company also introduced direct to consumer prearranged marketing in north america in which opens a new marketing channel with consumers to expand the scope of the company s prearragement activities 
the funds collected from consumers for prearranged funeral contracts are generally placed in trust accounts pursuant to applicable law or are used to pay premiums on life insurance policies from third party insurers 
at december   the company had deferred prearranged funeral contracts of  the recognition of deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues is estimated to occur in the following years as follows through  and thereafter  the company also believes that there are significant opportunities available to increase market share in the cremation segment of its markets through more effective marketing of cremation products and services 
while the company will continue to expand cremation memorialization products and services at its traditional funeral service locations and cemeteries  the company also plans to expand the company owned largest single provider of cremation services in north america  national cremation service r  from its existing base in ten states into seven additional states by the end of accounting change in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
which changes the company s accounting policies regarding the manner in which the company records preneed sales activities 
the implementation of sab no 
had no effect on the consolidated cash flows of the company 
the accounting change  which occurred as a result of the required implementation of sab no 
 has been treated as a change in accounting principle effective as of the beginning of in general  the change requires the company to recognize preneed cemetery interment right revenue from constructed cemetery property when at least of the sales price is received in cash from the customer  defer all preneed cemetery merchandise and service revenues and associated trust investment earnings until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed  and to defer only obtaining costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new preneed cemetery and funeral business 
for a more detailed discussion of these changes  see note three to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the cumulative effect of these changes resulted in an after tax charge of  or per diluted share 
generally  these changes will result in reduced cemetery revenues and operating income and reduced funeral operating income in the near future 
these changes are due to the deferral of previously recognized preneed cemetery merchandise  services and associated trust fund income until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed and recognizing as period costs certain direct selling and marketing costs previously deferred associated with preneed funeral activities

the primary reason for this decrease in funeral gross profits was a reduction in the number of deaths in in europe compared to as well as losses in market share in french funeral service locations 
funeral revenues increased by  in compared to primarily as a result of acquisitions 
funeral revenues in north america funeral service locations increased in compared to primarily as a result of the company s acquisition in january of equity corporation international eci  formerly the fourth largest company in the death care industry 
the company also acquired funeral service locations in spain  norway and the netherlands in resulting in increased funeral revenues in european funeral service locations in compared to funeral gross profits decreased by  in compared to primarily due to higher costs at acquired locations  specifically related to the company s merger with eci in january typically  acquisitions will temporarily exhibit lower gross profit margins until these locations have been fully assimilated into the company s clusters 
further  the gross margin percentage at eci locations had been historically lower than the company s gross margin percentages and this has negatively affected the total gross margin percentage in north america 
the decrease in european gross profit and margin percentage in was primarily the result of less funeral services performed causing reduced profit due to the company s fixed cost structure  coupled with delays in labor negotiations in france related to cost rationalization programs 
cemetery cemetery revenues decreased from  in to  in this decrease in cemetery revenues was primarily attributable to decreases in revenues in north america cemetery operations

cremations in the death care industry in recent years  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
outside of north america  the cremation rate is more stable 
the west coast of the united states and the states of arizona and florida have the highest concentration of cremation consumers in north america 
while cremations performed by the company in north america typically have higher gross profit margins than traditional funeral services  cremations usually result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars to the company than traditional funeral services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes nine and ten to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the company historically used derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to hedge the company s net investment in foreign assets 
the derivative instruments held by the company were for hedging purposes and were neither leveraged nor speculative in nature 
in  the company eliminated its participation in derivative transactions by terminating or assigning away all foreign currency and interest rate swaps as mentioned in note nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  thereby removing the company s hedges of foreign exchange rate and interest rate exposure and the diversification of floating rate exposure mentioned above 
at december   the company s total debt consisted of approximately of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
at december   after giving consideration to the interest rate swaps  the company s total debt consisted of approximately of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
approximately of the company s floating rate exposure  as of december   is based in eight markets other than the united states at december  
the company does not have a significant investment in foreign operations that are in highly inflationary economies 
approximately of the company s net investment and of its operating income are denominated in foreign currencies at december  marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with the company s prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise sales  the affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  and  are presented in notes five and six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk at december   the company s debt instruments were subject to interest rate and currency exchange rate risk 
the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of these risks on earnings 
this analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  the adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical impact 
a sensitivity analysis of those instruments with variable interest rate components was modeled to assess the impact that changing interest rates could have on pretax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the then prevailing interest rates with all other variables held constant 
given this model  the company s pretax earnings  on an annual basis  would be negatively impacted by approximately  on december   and  on december  a similar model was used to assess the impact of changes in foreign currencies on interest expense 
at december   the company s debt exposure was primarily associated with the british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar 
a adverse change in the strength of the us dollar against these currencies would have negatively impacted the company s interest expense  on an annual basis  by approximately  on december   and  on december
