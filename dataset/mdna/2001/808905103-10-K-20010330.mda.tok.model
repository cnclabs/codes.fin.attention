item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this document 
the following discussion also contains forward looking statements about our plans  objectives and future results 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  and we assume no obligation to update this information 
realization of these plans and results involves risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those set forth under risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel treatments for cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases 
our disease based technology platform integrates expertise in protein biology with computational and medicinal chemistry to identify novel targets and protein based small molecule compounds for large markets with unmet medical needs 
we have primarily focused on the development of two product candidates natrecor for the treatment of acute chf  and scio  an oral small molecule inhibitor of p kinase  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
we submitted an amendment to our nda for natrecor to the fda in january  and we expect the fda to respond to our application by july also in january  we completed a phase ia clinical trial evaluating the safety of scio  and we expect to complete a phase ib clinical trial in the second quarter of new accounting pronouncements emerging issues task force we adopted emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent in the fourth quarter of the effect of eitf resulted in netting revenues against related direct costs 
the financial statements for all periods presented have been reclassified accorrding to eitf we have a number of agreements that were impacted by eitf  including the psychiatric sales and marketing division  or pmsd  agreement with gsk  and the co promotion arrangements with gsk for paxil and janssen pharmaceutica inc for risperdal 
staff accounting bulletin we have completed our evaluation of the effects of sab and have concluded that the cumulative effect of adoption as of january  is immaterial to our financial position and results of operations 
sab requires that license and other up front fees received from research collaborators be recognized as earned over the term of the agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
however  certain revenue recognized in periods prior to january  would have been recognized in different periods in accordance with the provisions of sab in accordance with implementation provisions of sae the financial statements for years prior to january  have not been restated 
in the year ended december   we recorded a million license fee in connection with the natrecor commercialization agreement with bayer ag 
under sab  million of this license fee would have been reallocated from to the year ended december   the year in which the bayer ag commercialization agreement was terminated 
as a result  the loss for the year ended december  would have increased by million and the loss for the year ended december  would have decreased by million 
financial accounting standards no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of relationship that exists 
as amended  sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities and believe that the implementation of sfas will be immaterial to our financial position and results of operations 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of the accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this interpretation clarifies the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin no 
was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occured after either december  or january  the adoption of fin no

this license agreement was terminated in march  and effective april   we will no longer sell these products 
in  no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue 
in  research and development contract revenue from bayer ag accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
net product sales and co promotion commissions 
net product sales and co promotion commissions were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and were primarily derived from sales of psmd products 
the million decrease in net product sales and co promotion commissions from to was primarily the result of reduced distributor inventories caused by manufacturing and product shelf life issues of eskalith cr  coupled with sales erosion due to increased competition and the introduction of generic drugs 
the million increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase in prescriptions for psmd products resulting from increased marketing programs 
research and development contract revenues 
research and development contract revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to million in one time milestone payments received in from corporate partners chiron corporation and novo nordisk a s  million in clinical research funding from bayer ag and million in royalty payments from genvec  inc and guilford pharmaceuticals inc 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to million received from bayer ag in for the commercialization of natrecor 
the agreement with bayer ag was terminated in may after non approval of natrecor in april by the fda 
costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily attributable to the increased clinical expenses related to natrecor and increased research expenses related to our p kinase inhibitor program 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to our corporate restructuring in that included the layoff of personnel and the closure of a manufacturing facility 
marketing  general and administrative 
after the reclassification required by eitf  marketing  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily the result of natrecor pre launch activities  a proxy contest in early  outside consulting expenses relating to strategic planning  increased headcount and bonuses paid during the period 
the million increase from to was primarily attributable to increased outside consulting fees related to natrecor pre launch activities  our corporate restructuring in and product licensing activities 
restructuring charges 
we incurred a one time restructuring expense in of million resulting from a corporate reorganization  which included the closure of our mountain view manufacturing facility and a reduction in our workforce 
all restructuring activities were complete by the end of the second quarter of  leaving a remaining balance of million in the restructuring reserve 
this unused reserve primarily resulted from changes in the estimates of the cost of workforce reductions and the gain on the sale of excess capital assets that were unanticipated 
the reserve was credited to restructure expense in the second quarter of other income expense net other income expense was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to the net gain on the sales of securities in guilford 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to a reduction in realized gains on the sale of securities in guilford in and the increase in royalty expense to biotechnology research partners due to the licensing of fiblast to chiron 
equity in net loss of affiliate we had million in equity in net loss of affiliate in  which was the result of guilford s net losses 
our ownership in guilford declined from in may to at december  as a result of guilford s public stock offerings and our sale of guilford common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified our investment in guilford common stock as marketable securities 
in  we sold our entire holdings of guilford common stock 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our operations and capital requirements have been financed primarily with the proceeds of public and private sales of common stock and preferred stock  research and development partnerships  collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical firms  product sales and investment income 
at december   our combined cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  both current and non current  totaled million 
in anticipation of the launch of natrecor in the third quarter of  we entered into a sales and marketing agreement with innovex  a subsidiary of quintiles transnational corp 
we believe that this marketing alliance will allow us to quickly commercialize natrecor in the united states 
under the terms of the three and a half year agreement  pharmabio development  inc  an affiliate of innovex  has agreed to fund million of our costs to launch natrecor over the first months of natrecor s commercialization and to loan us up to million 
of the million  we anticipate that million will be paid to us in following fda approval of natrecor 
innovex will also identify  hire  train and deploy a dedicated cardiology and emergency medicine sales force of approximately people to launch and market natrecor 
net cash used in operating activities of million in was primarily attributable to the net loss in of million  partially offset by non cash charges 
for  net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily attributable to funding net operating losses  partially offset by non cash expenses and increases in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities of million in was largely due to deferred contract revenue of million  depreciation and accrued interest payable  partially offset by operating losses and decreases in operating assets and liabilities

we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and proceeds from existing collaborations  including our agreement with innovex and pharmabio  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for the next twelve months 
in the long term  and in the event that we do not receive fda approval to market natrecor  we will need to arrange additional financing for the operation of our business  including the commercialization of our products currently under development 
we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financings  including additional equity financings 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects and the general conditions of the financial markets 
income taxes at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and other tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not used 
our state net operating loss and other tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not used 
these net operating loss and other tax credit carryforwards provide an additional source of liquidity only to the extent that profitable operations are achieved prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods 
the use of losses generated through the date of our merger with nova pharmaceutical corporation may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of our business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we attempt to place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities  which consist of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity  net of applicable taxes 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the value of our investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
however  through our money manager  we maintain management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques as well as other procedures to review interest rate risk 
assuming a hypothetical interest rate increase of  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of december  would have potentially incurred a loss of  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is currently limited to our supply contract for natrecor  which is denominated in german marks 
changes in the exchange rate between german marks and the us dollar could adversely affect our manufacturing costs 
all of our other contracts are denominated in us dollars 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may change over time as our business evolves and our products are introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses
