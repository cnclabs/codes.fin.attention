the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to the company  the company s respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and its professional judgment 
the company then records  or accrues  an expense and a corresponding liability based upon the tpa s estimates for claims reserves 
as cash payments are made by the company s tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
the company has established additional reserves to provide for future unanticipated increases in expenses adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open injury claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods

gross margin for totaled  which represented a decrease of  or from the gross margin percent decreased from of revenues for to for the decrease in the gross margin percentage was due to higher workers compensation expenses and slightly higher direct payroll costs and payroll taxes and benefits 
the increase in workers compensation expense  in total dollars and as a percentage of revenues  was primarily due to an increase in the average cost per claim 
the increase in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  was attributable to increases in contract staffing and on site management  of which payroll costs generally represent a higher percentage of revenues 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits for was primarily attributable to increased direct payroll in california  which has a higher state unemployment tax rate as compared to other states in which the company operates 
the company expects gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  including the mix within the staffing segment  as well as the adequacy of its estimates for workers compensation liabilities  which may be negatively affected by unanticipated adverse loss development of claims reserves 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of the company s headquarters and the branch offices and the marketing of its services 
sg a expenses for amounted to  a decrease of  or from sg a expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenues  increased from for to for the decrease in total sg a dollars was primarily due to decreases in management payroll and related payroll tax expense  and profit sharing and related taxes

the company s effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the lower effective rate was primarily attributable to increased federal tax credits earned by the company 
the company offers various qualified employee benefit plans to its employees  including its work site employees 
these qualified employee benefit plans include a savings plan the k plan under section k of the internal revenue code the code  a cafeteria plan under code section  a group health plan  a group life insurance plan  and a group disability insurance plan 
generally  qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  qualified plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo arrangement has not been established 
the tax exempt status of the company s k plan and cafeteria plan is subject to continuing scrutiny and approval by the internal revenue service the irs and depends upon the company s ability to establish the company s employer employee relationship with peo employees 
the issue of whether the company s tax qualified benefit plans can legally include work site employees under their coverage has not yet been resolved 
if the work site employees cannot be covered by the plans  then the exclusive benefit requirement imposed by the code would not be met by the plans as currently administered and the plans could be disqualified 
the irs has established a market segment study group regarding employee leasing for the stated purpose of examining whether peos  such as the company  are the employers of work site employees under the code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans and are  therefore  able to offer to work site employees benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax treatment 
the irs study group is reportedly also examining whether the owners of client companies are employees of peo companies under code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans 
to the best of the company s knowledge  the market segment study group has not issued a report 
a peo company headquartered in texas stated publicly over five years ago that the irs national office was being requested by the irs houston district to issue a technical advice memorandum tam on the peo work site employee issue in connection with an ongoing audit of a plan of the texas peo company 
the stated purpose of tams is to help irs personnel in closing cases and to establish and maintain consistent holdings 
the irs s position is that tams are not precedential  that is  they are limited to the particular taxpayer involved and that taxpayer s set of facts 
the request for a tam by the irs houston district reportedly stated its determination that the texas peo company s code section k plan should be disqualified for the reason  among others  that it covers work site employees who are not employees of the peo company 
the timing and nature of the issuance and contents of any tam regarding the work site employee issue or any report of the market segment study group regarding employee leasing is unknown at this time 
there has also been public discussion for the past several years of the possibility that the treasury department may propose some form of administrative relief or that congress may provide legislative resolution or clarification regarding this issue 
in the event the tax exempt status of the company s benefit plans were to be discontinued and the benefit plans were to be disqualified  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is not presently able to predict the likelihood of disqualification nor the resulting range of loss  in light of the lack of public direction from the irs or congress

the company s effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the higher effective rate was primarily attributable to the nondeductibility of certain merger expenses 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has historically experienced significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and expects such fluctuations to continue in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality  wage limits on payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand and competition for the company s services and the effect of acquisitions 
the company s revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonality on its staffing services business and on certain of its peo clients in the agriculture and forest products related industries 
as a result  the company may have greater revenues and net income in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
payroll taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs  but tend to represent a smaller percentage of revenues and direct payroll later in the company s fiscal year as federal and state statutory wage limits for unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter  as well as adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position at december  decreased by  from december  the slight decrease in cash at december  was primarily due to cash used in financing activities of  principally in connection with common stock repurchases  payments on long term debt and net payments on credit line borrowings and cash used in investing activities of  offset in part by cash provided by operating activities of net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  as compared to  for for  cash flow was primarily generated by net income and depreciation and amortization  coupled with a decrease in accounts receivable of  offset in part by a decrease of  in accrued payroll and benefits

effective september   the company negotiated an accommodation to reduce the restrictiveness of one of the quarterly financial covenants and  in consideration  agreed to the imposition of an additional financial covenant 
as a result of a financial covenant violation as of december   the company  subsequent to year end  renegotiated with its bank several material amendments to the provisions of the agreement in consideration for the banks agreement to waive the covenant violation 
effective  march   the principal terms and conditions of the agreement  as amended  include a reduction in the total amount available under the revolving credit facility from million to the lesser of i million or ii percent of total trade accounts receivable at the end of any fiscal quarter  and a security interest in all trade accounts receivable 
due to the bank s secured position  the bank agreed to reduce the restrictiveness of certain financial covenants 
it is management s belief that these new terms and conditions will not be restrictive in the company s normal course of operation 
as a result of the bank provided waiver  the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the agreement  as amended  at december  management expects that the funds anticipated to be generated from operations  together with the bank provided credit facility and other potential sources of financing  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
although the agreement  as amended  expires on may   management expects this arrangement to be renewed with its current principal bank on terms and conditions which will not be materially less favorable to the company than the present terms 
if  however  the terms and conditions for renewal are unacceptable to the company  management will seek the most favorable terms available in the market 
during  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase common shares from time to time in open market purchases 
since inception  the board of directors have approved four increases in the total number of shares or dollars authorized to be repurchased under the program 
the repurchase program currently provides  to be used for the repurchase of additional shares at december  during  the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate price of  management anticipates that the capital necessary to execute this program will be provided by existing cash balances and other available resources 
inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the company s short term and long term debt obligations 
as of december   the company had interest bearing debt obligations of approximately million  of which approximately million bears interest at a variable rate and approximately million at a fixed rate of interest 
the variable rate debt is comprised of approximately million outstanding under a revolving credit facility  which bears interest at the federal funds rate plus and effective march   such revolving credit facility bears interest at prime less 
the company also has an unsecured three year term note with its principal bank  which bears interest at libor plus 
based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt or its results of operations 
as of december   the company had not entered into any interest rate instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk
