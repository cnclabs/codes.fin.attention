item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of first united corporation and subsidi aries collectively  the corporation including first united bank trust the bank  oakfirst life insurance corporation  gonder insurance agency  inc  first united auto finance  llc  oakfirst loan center  inc  and first united capital trust 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the finan cial statements which appear elsewhere in this report 
earnings analysis overview the corporation s net earnings for increased to million  or over the million reported for earnings for the year represent a record level of performance for the corporation  exceeding the previous record set in return on average assets was   and in   and  respectively 
the return on average shareholders equity for decreased to from the reported in the return on average shareholders equity was in earnings per share increased to in from in and in forward looking statements the corporation has made certain forward looking statements with respect to this discussion 
such statements should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ from forward looking informa tion as a result of any number of unforeseeable factors  which include  but are not limited to  the effect of prevailing economic conditions  the overall direction of government policies  unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment  competitive factors in the marketplace  and business risk associated with credit extensions and trust activities  and other risk factors discussed under the heading risk factors  beginning on page above 
these and other factors could lead to actual results that differ materially from man agement s statements regarding future performance 
net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income and related fees on earning assets  and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other borrowed funds  continued to be the primary source of earnings 
changes in interest rates  account balances  and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing funding sources affect this component of earnings 
growth in earning assets spurred an increase in total interest income of in  from million in to million in strong growth in deposits and increasing interest rates caused total interest expense to increase  from million in to million in interest on federal home loan bank borrowings and other borrowed funds increased million 
rising rates on the corporation s borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta coupled with new borrowings and other long term debt totaling million in the third quarter of caused this increase 
the net effect of these changes was a increase in net interest income to million in from million in table analyzes the changes in net interest income attributable to volume and rate components 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equiv alent basis 
this adjustment facilitates performance comparisons between tax able and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were tax able at the statutorily applicable rate 
in  rising rates caused net interest income to decrease million  however  volume caused net interest income to increase million 
the taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to in from in and in table com pares the components of the net interest margin and the changes occurring between   and allowance for possible credit losses the reserve for possible credit losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  ade quacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans and leases 
the corporation utilizes the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan and lease losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie commercial and homogeneous ie consumer loans 
each loan pool is ana lyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appro priate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of potential loss rates in the current portfolio 
these historical loss rates are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency and non accruals  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by the gathering of inform ation from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations are made for those loans in which the collateral value is less than the out standing loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
allocations are made for loan commitments using the methodology out lined above 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured or for the sba guaranteed portion of loans 
during  management continued to place emphasis on procedures for credit analysis  problem loan detection  and delinquency follow ups 
the provision for credit losses in increased to million or of gross loans 
the increase in expense is attributable to the increase in loan balances 
in  the provision for credit losses was also of gross loans 
the provision for credit losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross charge offs for the years ended december    and totaled   and 
million  respectively 
table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years 
table presents management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
specific allocations in any particular category may be reallocated in the future to reflect current conditions 
accordingly  the entire allowance is considered available to absorb losses in any category 
other operating income the corporation increased non interest income for by to million over the million earned in in  non interest income increased over the million earned in income from trust and fiduciary activities increased 
million over income of million to million 
in  the trust department opened new accounts totaling million 
the corresponding servicing fees and income earned on these new accounts caused income to increase 
million 
by concentrating efforts on collecting fees  service charge income increased 
million or in in  this source of income declined from to million 
insurance premium income from the corporation s insurance subsidiaries increased to million or compared to income of 
million 
in  insurance premium income was 
million 
other income increased 
million in to million as a result of the corporation s continued effort to expand its product lines 
other operating expense non interest expense increased million or from million in to million in much of this increase was driven by the increase of 
million or in salaries and employee benefits 
the operating results for the year ended included a full year of salary expense related to gonder insurance agency  which caused an increase of 
million in salaries and benefits 
also  more employees were rewarded for exceptional performance through the corporation s incentive program  resulting in incentive pay increasing 
million 
the corporation also experienced an increase in health care costs of 
million or 
additionally  the corporation continued its efforts to obtain future effic iencies and improve the accuracy of data processing  causing that expense to increase 
million or 
occupancy expense increased 
million 
an increase in personal and real property taxes accounts for 
million of this increase 
to combat these increases  management maintained control of other expenses  which decreased 
million  or 
applicable income taxes applicable income taxes are detailed in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense amounted to million in compared with million in and million in these amounts represented effective tax rates of   and for   and  respectively 
in  the corporation changed the status of its oakfirst life insurance subsidiary to an unaffiliated credit  life  and disability insurer 
this change of status caused the effective tax rate to decrease 
investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity  net of income taxes 
the corporation does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view of near term resales and therefore  does not own trading securities 
for additional information  see notes and to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
 was issued 
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
as permitted  the corporation early adopted this statement on july  with the exception of the reclassifi cation listed below  the adoption of statement no 
did not have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements  as the corpor ation does not enter into derivative contracts 
in connection with the adoption of this statement in  million of the investment securities pre viously classified as held to maturity were reclassified to available for sale 
as the securities were marked to market coincident with the reclassification  the change resulted in an increase of 
million  net of tax  to other com prehensive income 
total investment securities available for sale increased million or in from million in to million in in  us treasury securities decreased through a security maturity by 
million to a balance of 
million 
state and municipal securities decreased sharply to million in from million in seeking to maximize yield  the corporation sold million in state and municipal securities in the second quarter of the proceeds of the sale were then used to fund higher yielding loans 
mortgage backed securities decreased million 
late in the fourth quarter  the corporation sold million of mortgage backed securities and million in state and municipal securities to obtain funding for a bank owned life insurance boli policy 
this insurance policy is expected to go into effect in and will provide a higher return than the investment securities 
consequently  federal agency securities increased million to million as a portion of the funds are held in short term investments waiting the purchase of the boli policy 
the corporation manages its investment portfolios utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity  meet earnings objectives  and provide required collateral support for deposit activities 
excluding the us government sponsored agencies  the corporation had no concentration of investment securities from any single issues that exceeded of shareholders equity 
table exhibits the distribution  by type  of the investment portfolio for the three years ended december    and  respectively 
loan and lease portfolio the corporation  through its bank and other subsidiaries  is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington  and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy  berkeley  hampshire counties in west virginia  and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
the corporation has policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the reserve for possible credit losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the level of risk  size of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
table presents the composition of the corporation s loan and lease portfolio 
it has been the historical policy of the corporation to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves 
the corporation had no foreign loans in its portfolio as of december  during  gross loans increased million or to million 
loan growth in equaled million or to a total of million 
the indirect lending portfolio  the driver of much of the loan growth in previous years  decreased million from million as of december   to million as of december  this decline occurred as a result of management s decision to slow loan growth by maintaining higher rates on installment loans to maximize yield 
overall  the installment portfolio decreased million or to million as of december  in  the corporation formed first united auto finance  llc  an auto leasing company 
as of december   first united auto finance had leases totaling million 
this represents growth of million or over the ending balance of million 
total mortgages secured by real estate increased million or in  from million as of december   to million as of december  most of this growth occurred in commercial mortgages  growing million to a level of million as of december  the corporation also experienced strong growth in its one to four family residential mortgages  increasing million in net of a loan sale of million that occurred in the fourth quarter 
funding for loan growth during was provided by increased levels of deposits from within our market area and brokered deposits 
in  the cor poration also utilized borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and brokered deposits 
it is the policy of the corporation to place a loan in non accrual status whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on the outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
at december   the corporation had million of non accrual loans 
table details the historical activity of non accrual loans 
deposits and other funding deposit liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december  this is an increase of million or 
the deposit growth includes an increase of million in brokered deposits 
during the year ended december   the corporation chose not to renew a million brokered deposit that matured in march in december  the corporation purchased million of brokered deposits as part of a plan to allow the trust department to invest a portion of its liquid assets in investments outside of the bank 
because the brokered deposit rates are lower than those paid on the trust deposits  this plan will reduce the interest expense of the bank 
demand deposit account balances  including one accounts  increased million to million in the corporation introduced a new cash management product  allowing its commercial customers to earn a higher interest rate on checking account balances 
the cash management product provided million in growth 
these deposits provide the corporation with a source of low cost funds 
borrowings from the fhlb decreased from million at december  to million at december  the cor poration has a credit line with the fhlb 
as of december   the collat eralized credit line equaled million  and available borrowings are million 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides more detail on the line of credit 
first united capital trust the trust  a delaware business trust organized by the corporation on july   issued million of aggregate liquidation amount of preferred securities the capital securities 
the payment terms require the trust to distribute annually per liquidation amount of capital securities  with equal payments on march  june  september  and december of each year  beginning september  under the federal reserve board s current risk based capital guidelines  the capital securities are includable in the corporation s tier i and tier ii capital 
for financial statement purposes these securities are classified as other borrowed funds 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier ii capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the reserve for possible credit losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are re quired to maintain a minimum of for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier i ratio of 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking companies must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assess ments 
the corporation s capital policy estab lishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into account current or anticipated risks and future growth opportunities 
at december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratios for year end and were and  respec tively 
total shareholders equity increased million to million at dec ember   from million at year end the increase in share holders equity can be explained by earnings growth and an increase in accumu lated comprehensive income 
the equity to assets ratio at december   was  compared with at year end on july   as part of the corporation s capital plan  the board of directors also authorized the corporation s officers to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock 
purchases of the corporation s stock under the program were completed in brokered transactions or directly from the corpora tion s market makers 
on april   the board of directors ratified an amendment to the plan  which would enable the corporation s management to re purchase an additional or  shares 
as of december    or of the previously outstanding shares have been repurchased and retired under the plan authorized by the board of directors 
cash dividends of

asset and liability management introduction the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to as sess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while main taining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implement ing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and mar ketability of assets 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to assure that the withdrawal de mands of depositors and the legitimate credit needs of the corporation s de lineated market areas are accommodated 
total liquid assets  represented by cash  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in banks  investment se curities available for sale and loans and leases maturing within one year  amounted to million  or of total assets at december  this compares with million  or of total assets  and million  or of total assets 
additional liquidity of million is available from unused lines of credit at various upstream correspondent banks and the fhlb of atlanta 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be im pacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics be tween assets and liabilities 
management seeks to avoid fluctuating net inter est margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the in terest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and lia bilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than lia bilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit the corporation during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management of the corporation formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods 
management does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that the corporation was liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on pre tax income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
normally  when an organization is liability sensitive there is a positive impact to income when interest rates decline 
the simulation analysis shown below shows a positive impact when interest rates decline or basis points in and based on the simulation analysis performed at year end  the corporation estimates the following changes in income before taxes  assuming the indicated rate changes december  basis point increase million basis point increase million basis point decrease 
million basis point decrease 
million december  basis point increase million basis point increase million basis point decrease 
million basis point decrease 
million this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforesee able factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single matu rity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between prime rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to cur rent or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corpor ation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of inter est rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin
