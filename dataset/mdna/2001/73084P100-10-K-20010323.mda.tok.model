among these changes are risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  the quality of specific loans  the level of nonaccruing loans  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies or charge offs and the value of underlying collateral  all of which are subject to change 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses of million is adequate at december  results of operations the operating results of the company depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
net interest income is determined by the difference between yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s interest rate spread is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
in addition  the company s net earnings are also affected by the level of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate  as well as the level of its noninterest income  and its noninterest expenses  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment costs and losses on foreclosed real estate and income taxes

the company used its capital resources principally to purchase securities and fund existing and continuing loan commitments 
at december   the company had commitments to originate loans totaling million 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the months following december  totaled million 
management believes the company has adequate resources to fund all of its commitments  that substantially all of its existing commitments will be funded within the next twelve months and  if so desired  that it can adjust the rates on certificates of deposit to attract deposits in a changing interest rate environment

the company on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and percentages set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december  and  that the company and the bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
under fdic regulations  the bank is required to meet certain minimum regulatory capital requirements 
this is not a valuation allowance and has not been created by charges against earnings 
it represents a restriction on stockholders equity 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulatory authorities categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized  an institution must maintain minimum total risk based  tier i risk based  and tier i leverage percentages as set forth in the following tables 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank s category 
the company and the bank s actual capital amounts and percents as of december  and are also presented in the table dollars in thousands

management believes that these processes and procedures provide the company with better capital planning  asset mix and volume controls  loan pricing guidelines  and deposit interest rate guidelines which should result in tighter controls and less exposure to interest rate risk 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
the gap ratio is computed as dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap ratio of represents perfect matching 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on the results of operations  the company s management continues to monitor asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
such policies have consisted primarily of i emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans  ii maintaining a stable core deposit base  and iii maintaining a significant portion of liquid assets cash and short term investments 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that are estimated to mature or are scheduled to reprice within the period shown

while commercial business loans generally are made for shorter terms and at higher yields than one to four family residential loans  such loans generally involve a higher level of risk than one to four family residential loans 
to a lesser extent  the bank originates and services small business administration sba loans  which are underwritten in accordance with the guidelines of the sba 
these loans are made to small businesses and usually require that significant collateral be assigned to the bank from the borrower 
typically  the sba guarantees to of the loan balance with the remaining portion unguaranteed 
the bank is permitted to sell the sba guaranteed portion of the loan in secondary markets  with the bank retaining the portion that is not guaranteed 
the bank is compensated by the premium derived from the sale into the secondary market and a servicing fee on the sold guaranteed portion 
sba loans are similar to commercial business loans in yield and credit risk 
the bank s commercial real estate loans at december  totaled million or of the bank s portfolio 
the portfolio primarily consisted of owner occupied commercial properties and generally have terms ranging from fifteen to twenty years and interest rate adjustment periods ranging from monthly to five years 
amortization periods for commercial mortgage loans generally do not exceed years

consumer loan underwriting standards include an examination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and an evaluation of the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary importance  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security  if any  in relation to the proposed loan amount 
while consumer loans generally involve a higher element of credit risk than one to four family residential loans  consumer loans are typically made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms  or at adjustable rates  and are helpful in maintaining a profitable spread between the bank s loan yield and its cost of funds

unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
future accounting requirements financial accounting standards accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
the company will be required to adopt this statement effective january  management does not anticipate that this statement will have a material impact on the company
