item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not historical facts  and are based on current expectations  estimates  and projections about our industry  our beliefs  our assumptions  and our goals and objectives 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  and estimates  and variations of these words and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
examples of the kinds of forward looking statements in this report include statements regarding the following we believe we are a market leader  our new fab will fulfill our wafer manufacturing capacity needs  current backlog will be shipped in fiscal  our customers problems with excess inventory may continue through at least the first half of fiscal  and our patents may have value and may be useful for cross licensing 
these statements are only predictions  are not guarantees  of future performance  and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict  and could cause actual results to differ materially form those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described below in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
risk factors semiconductor companies as a group are subject to many similar risks 
these include the risks that the demand for semiconductors decreases as the industry has historically been very cyclical  there are shortages of raw materials and or fab capacity  there are changes in underlying circuit or process technology or fab technology  or there is litigation regarding third party patents 
other factors that could affect our future results include whether we can generate new bookings from both new and current products  general economic conditions  both in the united states and foreign markets  and economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  risks associated with customer concentration  our ability to introduce new products  to enhance existing products  and to meet the continually changing requirements of our customers  our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors and independent distributors and sales representatives  and whether we can manufacture efficiently and control costs 
in addition  we are subject to the below described risks  which are specific to us and our business we have focused our product offerings primarily on niche markets which leverage our capabilities and which we believe we can dominate 
we attempt to choose markets which are sizable enough to be worth pursuing but which are not large enough to attract fierce competition 
these markets could grow enough to attract increased competition or else competitors could enter due to happenstance or down turns elsewhere 
in addition  these niches might be more susceptible to shrinkage than more diverse markets  due to their concentration on a few product offerings 
we are dependent upon one fab which we own and operate 
we would be susceptible were this fab to be unable to meet our needs  for example  were this fab to become obsolete due to process technology changes  or to be damaged  for example by fire or earthquake 
we could encounter difficulties in operating our fab  such as contaminants in the air or defects in equipment  which could affect yields and production 
we have several competitors which are substantially larger and could bring to bear substantially more resources in our niche markets 
we have been able to maintain high margins in part because of our dominance of most of our niche markets 
increased competition could cause our margins to decrease 
our outstanding stock is owned more than by henry pao  president  ceo  and a director  and his father and brother 
they have no agreement among themselves to act together with respect to the company or their stockholdings 
were they to act in concert  they would be our largest shareholder and would have an ability to elect one or more directors  to direct management  and to delay or prevent a change in control 
we sell a substantial amount of our products internationally 
problems with foreign economies or wars  or changes in the exchange rate  could adversely affect our foreign sales 
we depend upon one customer  microtek  for approximately of our sales 
microtek is our primary distributor in japan with at least twenty end customers 
most of our customers can typically cancel or reschedule orders without penalty so decreased demand for our products could translate into decreased sales very rapidly 
we are very dependent upon continued innovation of our engineers 
the competition for engineers with relevant experience is extremely intense in the silicon valley  where most of our engineers are located 
we must compete in terms of salary  benefits  and working conditions with many start ups which can offer more equity 
we have started an ic design center in hong kong where competition is not as intense 
we are dependent upon several key persons for management and engineering expertise 
their loss would be detrimental to us 
the shortage of energy supplies in california could have a negative impact on the company s future operating performance 
california is currently experiencing prolonged energy alerts caused by the shortage and substantially increased costs of electricity and natural gas supplies 
our six inch wafer fabricating facility  process engineering  and telecom design functions are all located in san jose  california  and certain product engineering  assembly  and testing activities are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california 
while we maintain emergency generation capability for health  life and safety  it is not sufficient to maintain our fab at an operational status 
future interruptions in our power supplies or further increases in our power costs could have a material adverse affect on our operations and our financial results 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table sets forth items from the statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended march  net sales costs of sales research and development selling  general and administrative write off of acquired in process technology income from operations other income interest income other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes net income overview supertex designs  develops  manufactures  and markets high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits utilizing state of the art high voltage dmos  hvcmos and hvbicmos analog and mixed signal technologies 
we supply standard and custom interface products primarily for the use in the telecommunications  imaging  and medical electronics markets 
we also provide wafer foundry services for the manufacture of integrated circuits for customers using customer owned designs and mask toolings 
recent developments during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced a slowing of demand for our products 
sales were unexpectedly weak during the third quarter  partly due to a last minute delivery stretch out by our customers resulting  we believe  from their inventory corrections  and partly due to a slowdown in the telecom capital equipment industry 
in the fourth quarter  sales were adversely affected by the company s decision to hold up shipments to our certain customers pending resolution of credit issues 
our sales continued to be affected by the general slowdown in the economy and in particular the abrupt business deceleration at our telecom equipment customers 
we believe that our customers problems with excess inventory may continue through at least the first half of fiscal year due to the global economic slowdown  with weakness in almost all the markets we serve 
we are hopeful that as the economy recovers in the coming quarters  these problems will be resolved 
despite the general slowdown  we have continued our heavy investment in research and development  in particular  in driver integrated circuits for optical mems and network power interface circuits for photonic and gigabit ethernet modules and voice over internet protocol voip telephone systems 
we expect to release a record number of new products in the new fiscal year  although they may not contribute materially to our sales in their first year 
we are also reviewing several cost reduction programs which may be implemented in the coming quarters 
results of operations fiscal vs fiscal net sales the company had net sales of  in fiscal  an increase of  or from the previous fiscal year 
the increase in the current year s net sales is primarily due to increased unit sales volume of both core and foundry products 
our core business consists of proprietary products for the telecommunications  imaging and medical electronics industries 
as percentage of total sales for the year ended march   sales to the medical market accounted for of total sales in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the telecommunications market represented and of total sales for the fiscal year and  respectively 
sales to the imaging market accounted for of total sales for fiscal compared to in fiscal sales to all other markets represented in fiscal and in fiscal on a dollar basis  sales of our medical electronics products increased to  sales of our telecommunications products increased to  and sales of our imaging products increased to  in fiscal  the company derived approximately of its net sales from customers outside the united states  primarily in asia and europe  compared to in fiscal dollar sales to international customers also increased approximately  primarily due to increase in unit sales volume to western europe 
gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal year this compared to for fiscal year the improvement in gross margin is primarily due to higher production volume in our new six inch fab operation  with its increased economies of scale 
research and development research and development r d expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in r d expense for this year was attributed to the increase in payroll and benefit expense of  and the transfer costs of  relating to a the development and re tooling of the old mask sets of our proprietary products  and b the development of new processes for the six inch fab 
during the year  we staffed and equipped our new design center in hong kong and the special telecom project design group in san jose  california 
in february  the company acquired certain assets related to the six inch fabrication facility of orbit semiconductor for a total cash purchase price of approximately  including direct costs incurred 
the acquisition of assets has been accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations have been included in the consolidated statement of operations of the company from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired based on their respective fair values 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows in thousands property and equipment  purchased technology  assembled workforce in process technology  the amounts allocated to purchased technology and assembled workforce were determined through known valuation techniques in the high technology industry 
the in process technologies were wafer manufacturing processes which were under development 
these technologies were valued on the premise of fair market value in continued use  employing a version of the income approach referred to as the discounted cash flow method 
this methodology is based on discounting to present value  at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate  the net cash flow that is expected to result from owning these technologies 
supertex management is primarily responsible for the valuation of the acquired in process research and development 
the value assigned to in process technology was determined by identifying development projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible 
these cash flows were discounted back to their present value and a percentage of completion discount was applied to the calculation 
the discount rate used was based on the relative risk involved with intangible assets of this nature  and included an analysis of various factors that could influence the risk associated with realizing projected revenues during the economic life 
the cost of equity was calculated at 
this plus a risk premium was determined as the appropriate discount rate to use 
the premium reflects the additional uncertainty and risk inherent in technology under development and the amount of time remaining to complete the technology 
the percentage of completion for the in process projects ranged from to complete  resulting in estimated cost to complete of  the technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the entire  has been charged to operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal at the acquisition of the orbit inch fab  there were seven processes in the research and development phase 
these processes were being developed without any specific product of supertex in mind  merely to be added to the company s broad range of available processes offered to the general foundry market 
the potential applications for each of these processes and their description are described below process no 
nature of application very high density analog logic circuits very high density digital logic circuits charged coupled device ccd imaging circuits and infrared sensors low voltage hand held equipment fluorescent lamps display drivers high density analog or mixed signal circuits precision temperature control or sensing circuits the status of each of the above process at the time of acquisition are further described in the following table status of acquired in process manufacturing technologies as of february  project percent of total cost to expected start of risk adjusted no 
completion development complete time to material net discount rate cost complete cash inflows  fiscal fiscal  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal all of the above processes were completed by march  and there were no significant variances to the original expected completion dates  projected original revenues and anticipated cost to complete the project 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to  for fiscal dollar increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of  additional staff  salary adjustment and related benefit of  commission on sales of  and consulting fees of  interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal 
jlcompared to  in fiscal the increase in interest income was due to larger average cash and investment balance 
other income expense other expense of  for fiscal consist mainly of an impairment charge taken in the fourth fiscal quarter of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of an investment in a start up company 
in fiscal  other income of  consists primarily of gain on disposal of surplus equipment and sublease expenses net of sublease income 
provision for income taxes income taxes for fiscal and were at and respectively  of income before provision for income taxes 
fiscal vs fiscal net sales the company had net sales of  in fiscal  an increase of  or from the previous fiscal year 
the increase in the current year s net sales is primarily due to the addition of the foundry business resulting from the acquisition of the submicron wafer fabrication facility fab on february  this foundry business represented of the total increase over fiscal net sales 
the remaining of the increase over fiscal net sales is due to increased sales of core products 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s net sales were derived from customers outside the united states  primarily in europe and asia versus in fiscal 
the decrease in percentage of international sales is primarily due to the acquisition and growth of the foundry business  which has only us customers 
international sales represented and of net sales from our core business in fiscal and  respectively 
all of the company s sales to international customers were denominated in us currencies 
there was no currency exchange exposure 
gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was and  in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin for the current fiscal year was adversely affected by the company incurring additional overhead expenses as a result of operating two fabs  including the depreciation of the capitalized assets and the amortization of other assets associated with the new fab 
gross margin during fiscal was also affected by lower margins associated with the foundry business resulting from the acquisition of the company s new fab 
research and development research and development expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
while the dollar expenditure for fiscal is higher than the prior fiscal year  the growth in net sales caused the percentage of research and development expense to net sales to decline 
the increase in research and development dollar expenditure is due to expenses incurred in process transfer and development 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to  for fiscal while the selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively the same as the previous year  the increase in net sales amount caused the percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease 
interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal the decrease in interest income was caused by the decrease in cash available for investment due to the purchase of the new fab 
other income other income of  for fiscal consists primarily of gain on disposal of surplus equipment and sublease expenses net of sublease income 
the increase in this category for the fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the gain on disposal of surplus equipment 
provision for income taxes income taxes for fiscal and were at and  respectively  of income before provision for income taxes 
the current fiscal year s tax provision is compared to a lower tax provision for fiscal higher tax credits and additional expenses from the acquisition of the six inch fab caused fiscal tax rate to be significantly lower 
financial condition overview total assets grew to  at the end of fiscal  up from  at the end of fiscal the increase was due primarily to profit generated from operations during the year 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company had  in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  compared with  on march  and compared with  on march  the company s primary source of funds for fiscal   and has been the net cash generated from operating activities of   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of  consisted principally of net income of  and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  factors affecting cash flow from operating activities are as follows there was an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of  due to the existence of certain slow paying customers with large past due balances there was an increase in income taxes payable of  due to higher amount of taxable income 
there was an impairment charge of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of an investment in a start up company there was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  resulting from normal operating activities there was an increase in deferred revenue of  there was an increase in accounts receivable of  primarily caused by the increase in net sales there was an increase deferred income taxes of  there was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  relating primarily to the remaining prepaid software license and maintenance contract of  there was a gain from sale of four inch fab equipment of  net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was  which consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities of short term investments of  offset by purchases of short term investments of  purchases of long term investments of  and the purchase of property and equipment of  net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  which consisted of proceeds from exercises of stock options of  partially offset by repurchases of the company s common stock in the amount of  as of march   the company s working capital was  which included approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company anticipates that the available funds and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements through the end of fiscal the company expects to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions during fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is allowed as of the beginning of any quarter beginning after issuance 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective april  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on its the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities 
the company has no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed
