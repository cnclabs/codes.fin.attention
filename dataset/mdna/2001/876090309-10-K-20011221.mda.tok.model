results of operations net revenues the company s net revenues are derived from software licenses and fees for services  which include engineering services  consulting  custom engineering  support and training 
net revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal in fiscal  net revenues decreased by from million in fiscal the decline in revenue performance in fiscal was worldwide across all geographies and is attributable to the sale of a significant portion of our business 
the company s revenues were also impacted by the general reduction in information technology it investments by companies for application server software and service initiatives 
the fiscal decline in revenue performance was worldwide across most geographies and is attributable to delays in large project deals as well as customer delays due to year issues and other market factors 
the recovery of the customer channel from the impact of year has been slower than expected 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  no single customer accounted for more than of the company s net revenues

license revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal over and a decrease of in fiscal over license revenues were of total net revenues for fiscal and and of total net revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal decline in license revenues is attributed to fewer large project deals and other market factors and the sale of the server business to caldera 
the fiscal to license revenue decrease was due to customer delays due to year issues and a slower than expected recovery of the sales channel from the impact of yk 
services revenues 
services revenues decreased to million in fiscal  a decrease of from the million in fiscal revenue from services remained relatively constant in fiscal at million  a increase over the million level of fiscal services revenues were of the total revenue for fiscal  compared to in the prior year 
the decline in services revenues was primarily in the professional services area and is the result of re focusing of the professional services division on the implementation of new strategies in conjunction with the sale of the professional services business to caldera 
cost of revenues the company s overall cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues can be affected by mix changes in net revenue contribution between product families  geographic regions and channels of distribution  since both price and cost characteristics associated with these revenue streams can vary greatly 
the company can also experience fluctuations in gross margin as net revenues increase or decrease since certain costs of revenues including technology  services  product assembly and distribution act as fixed costs within certain volume ranges 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues includes royalties paid to certain software vendors  amortization of acquired technologies  product packaging  documentation and all costs associated with the acquisition of components  assembling of finished products  warehousing and shipping 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease from to was primarily due to the expiration of several technology obligations 
additionally  material costs continue to decline as a result of the increasing number of internet orders 
also certain fixed costs such as technology and overhead declined 
the increase from to was due to the impact of having fixed costs over lower unit sale volume 
these fixed costs include technology and overhead costs 
this impact is partially offset by declining material costs resulting from the continuing growth of e commerce business 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues includes documentation  consulting and personnel related expenses associated with providing such services 
costs of services revenues as a percentage of services revenues decreased to from in fiscal  which in turn was a decrease from in fiscal the improvement in cost of services revenues in fiscal is primarily a result of reduced staffing levels in both the support and professional services organizations due to realignments of these organizations 
the decrease in fiscal resulted from relatively constant costs as a percentage of higher fiscal revenues 
research and development the company invests in research and development both for new products and to provide continuing enhancements to current products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was a decrease of from fiscal spending of million 
research and development expenses represented of net revenues for fiscal  of net revenues for fiscal  and of net revenues for fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal and can be attributed to lower labor costs driven by lower headcount as a result of a planned reduction in force 
fiscal spending was also favorably impacted by the sale of the server software and professional services divisions to caldera 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal sales and marketing expenses represented of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is due to lower labor costs as a result of the sale of the server and professional services division to caldera combined with reductions driven by lower headcount as a result of a planned reduction in force 
the decrease in fiscal is due to a decline in sales program costs that vary directly with revenue  including commissions and cooperative advertising 
the increase as a percentage of revenue in both fiscal and fiscal is due to revenues declining faster than the company was able to reduce expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative represented of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the significant increase in general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue is due to fixed costs spread over much lower revenue as well as the payment of executive retention bonuses of million associated with the sale of the majority of the business to caldera 
the transfer of certain staff from other functions due to the creation of the company s divisions drove the increase in fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of september  was million  or of gross accounts receivable 
at the end of september   allowance for doubtful accounts was million  or of gross accounts receivable 
the reason for the significant increase in allowance for doubtful accounts is because the company retained all accounts receivable when they sold the server and professional services divisions to caldera

the restructuring charges included a reduction in personnel of approximately employees  write off of certain acquired technologies  write off of certain fixed assets  and elimination of non essential facilities 
of the million  million related to cash expenditures and million related to non cash charges 
the restructuring charge included cash expenditures of million for severance costs and million for facilities costs 
the non cash charges related to disposals of fixed assets and write off of technology 
the disposal of fixed assets was comprised of computer equipment that was no longer in use due to the reduction of personnel 
losses on the disposal of these fixed assets were recorded against the restructuring charge 
the amount of these charges was  the technology write off relates to technology that was no longer used in product development due to the reduction in development personnel 
the company restructured its business operations into three independent divisions  each with a separate management team and dedicated development  marketing and sales organizations the server division  the tarantella division and the professional services division 
the company believed this reorganization would create independent focused teams that could pursue revenue in their respective markets and was effective april  the company believed that as a result of creating these independent  focused organizations the company would be better able to control and measure the success of these businesses 
as a result of the restructuring plans various regional offices in the united states  united kingdom  latin america and the asia pacific region were eliminated 
the us regional facilities and the watford  uk leases were vacated and restored  and subsequently sub let or terminated

the cost basis of the sale was million  and the company realized a gain of million from this sale 
in fiscal the company recorded a gain on the sale of shares of rainmaker stock of million  net of an other than temporary decline in another investment position of million 
the decrease in other income from fiscal to fiscal was due to gains from the partial liquidation of converted debentures of a domestic distribution channel partner of million  net of an other than temporary decline in another investment position of million which were included in the fiscal results but did not recur in fiscal in fiscal there was a million gain included in other income for the sale of the server and professional services divisions to caldera 
there was also a charge taken for the impairment of the caldera investment in the amount of million  net of the unamortized portion of negative goodwill 
the fiscal results also include million for the loss from the equity investment in caldera 
this loss is net of million of negative goodwill related to the excess of net assets in caldera over the value of the investment at the time of closing 
income taxes in fiscal  and  the company s effective income tax rates were  and 
the fiscal tax benefit of million reflects a benefit of million due to the resolution of foreign audit issues and foreign income taxes of million 
the fiscal tax primarily reflects the write off of deferred tax assets of million and foreign income taxes of million 
the fiscal tax primarily reflects foreign income taxes 
net income loss the company reported a net loss of million in fiscal compared to net loss of million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal although revenues were significantly lower in fiscal  the net losses decreased by due to the net gain recorded for the caldera transaction 
the net loss in fiscal is primarily due to lower revenues  restructuring charges and the reduction of net deferred tax assets 
the net income in fiscal was driven by strong revenue performance  which was directly related to the increasing importance of server based computing as well as customers upgrading in preparation for year liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at september   representing of total assets 
the decrease in cash and short term investments of million is due to operating losses  lower revenues and a decrease in sales linearity  which resulted in lower cash collections 
the company s operating activities used cash of million during fiscal  compared to million used for operating activities for fiscal cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided from investing of million in fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to the proceeds received from the caldera transaction 
cash provided for financing activities was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the company s days sales outstanding dso at the end of fiscal was  an increase of days from the end of fiscal the increase in dso at the end of fiscal was due to a deterioration of sales linearity during the fourth quarter as well as increased delinquent accounts receivable 
it is expected that dso for tarantella will not fluctuate significantly from the days at the end of fiscal dso are expected to remain at higher levels than prior years because a larger portion of the products are now sold directly to the customer and this type of sale does not have the even linearity seen in sales through distribution 
as of september   the company had an equity investment in rainmaker systems having a fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
in january  the company sold  shares of its rainmaker stock for per share  and received cash proceeds of million 
the cost basis of the sale was million  and the company realized a gain of million from this sale 
the company has incurred net losses from operations of approximately million during fiscal and million during fiscal and revenues have declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal for fiscal losses from operations were million  compared to million during fiscal the company has an accumulated deficit of million as of september  in connection with the transaction with caldera  the company entered into a loan agreement and a secured convertible promissory note effective january   with the canopy group for borrowings up to million 
draws on the financing agreement are repayable on december  and bear interest at a rate per annum of 
draws are collateralized by the company s tangible and intangible assets and are convertible into common stock at the option of the lender at the closing price of the company s common stock on the date of issuance  subject to certain limitations 
the unconverted principal is repayable in cash 
the company has not drawn on this line of credit 
the company believes that  based on its current plans its existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  funds generated from operations and available borrowing capabilities will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements through fiscal  however additional financing may be required thereafter 
factors that may affect future results set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents the company files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statement in this report 
company s operating results may fluctuate in future periods the results of operations for any quarter or fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods 
the company s operating results have in the past been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to overall technology spending changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the internet infrastructure industry rapid technological changes that can adversely affect the demand for the company s products fluctuations in demand for the company s products and services the public s perception of tarantella and its products the long sales and implementation cycle for the company s products general industry trends and the potential effects of price and product competition in the internet infrastructure industry the introduction and acceptance of new technologies and products reductions in sales to  or loss of  any significant customers the timing of orders  timing of shipments  and the ability to satisfy all contractual obligations in customer contracts the impact of acquired technologies and businesses the company s ability to control spending and achieve targeted cost reductions the ability of the company to generate cash adequate to continue operations the potential loss of key employees the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel adverse changes in the value of equity investments in third parties held by the company the ability of the company s customers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures as a consequence  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict 
the company is exposed to general economic and market conditions any significant downturn in the companies customers markets  or domestic and global conditions  which result in a decline in demand for their software and services could harm the business 
the terrorist attacks of september   the subsequent military response by the united states and future events occurring in response to  or in connection with the attacks may negatively impact the economy in general 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the software industry 
this could result in customers delaying or canceling orders for software 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on the companies operating results  revenues and costs and may cause the market price of their common stock to decline or become more volatile 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various uncertain trends and factors that are beyond the company s control 
these include adverse changes in general economic conditions and rapid or unexpected changes in the technologies affecting the company s products 
the process of developing new high technology products is complex and uncertain and requires accurate anticipation of customer needs and technological trends 
the company depends on the development and acceptance of new products in a rapidly changing market the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolution of new industry standards  and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
the company s success will depend upon its continued ability to enhance its existing products  to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis to meet evolving customer requirements  to achieve market acceptance for new product offerings  and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products or that such new or enhanced products will receive market acceptance 
the company s success also depends upon its ability to license from third parties and to incorporate into its products new technologies that become industry standards 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to obtain such licenses on favorable terms or that it will successfully incorporate such third party technologies into its own products 
the company anticipates new releases of products in the fiscal year ending september  there can be no assurance that such new releases will not be affected by technical problems or bugs  as is common in the software industry 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that these or other future product introductions will not be delayed 
delays in the availability  or a lack of market acceptance  of new or enhanced products could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
there can be no assurance that product introductions in the future will not disrupt product revenues and adversely affect operating results 
the company competes in the highly competitive internet infrastructure market the industry has become increasingly competitive and  accordingly  the company s results may also be adversely affected by the actions of existing or future competitors  including the development of new technologies  the introduction of new products  and the reduction of prices by such competitors to gain or retain market share 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if it were required to lower its prices significantly 
operating results for a particular quarter are difficult to predict the company participates in a highly dynamic industry and future results could be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
the company s revenues and operating results may be unpredictable due to the company s shipment patterns 
the company operates with little backlog of orders because its products are generally shipped as orders are received 
in general  a substantial portion of the company s revenues have been booked and shipped in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the latter half of that third month 
in addition  the timing of closing of large license contracts and the release of new products and product upgrades increase the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations and the uncertainty of quarterly operating results 
the company s staffing and operating expense levels are based on an operating plan and are relatively fixed throughout the quarter 
as a result  if revenues are not realized in the quarter as expected  the company s expected operating results and cash balances could be adversely affected  and such effect could be substantial and could result in an operating loss and depletion of the company s cash balances 
in such event  it may not be possible for the company to secure sources of cash to maintain operations 
the company s revenues may be affected by the seasonality of revenues in the european and government markets the company experiences seasonality of revenues for both the european and the us federal government markets 
european revenues during the quarter ending june are historically lower or relatively flat compared to the prior quarter 
this reflects a reduction of customer purchases in anticipation of reduced selling activity during the summer months 
sales to the us federal government generally increase during the quarter ending september this seasonal increase is primarily attributable to increased purchasing activity by the us federal government prior to the close of its fiscal year 
additionally  net revenues for the first quarter of the fiscal year are typically lower or relatively flat compared to net revenues of the prior quarter 
revenues may be affected by changes in the mix of products and services the overall cost of revenues may be affected by changes in the mix of net revenue contribution between licenses and services  product families  geographical regions and channels of distribution  as the costs associated with these revenues may have substantially different characteristics 
the company may also experience a change in margin as net revenues increase or decrease since technology costs  services costs and production costs are fixed within certain volume ranges 
the company s operational results could be affected by price variations the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if it were to lower its prices significantly 
in the event the company reduced its prices  the company s standard terms for selected distributors provide credit for inventory ordered in the previous days  such credits to be applied against future purchases 
the company  as a matter of policy  does not allow product returns for refund 
product returns are generally allowances for stock balancing and are accompanied by compensating and offsetting orders 
revenues are net of a provision for estimated future stock balancing and excess quantities above levels the company believes are appropriate in its distribution channels 
the company monitors the quantity and mix of its product sales 
the company is dependant upon information received from third parties in order to determine inventory and reserves the company depends on information received from external sources in evaluating the inventory levels at distribution partners in the determination of reserves for the return of materials not sold  stock rotation and price protection 
significant effort has gone into developing systems and procedures for determining the appropriate reserve level 
the company s business depends upon its proprietary rights and there is a risk that such rights will be infringed the company attempts to protect its software with a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  license agreements  and other methods of protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information the company regards as proprietary 
while the company s competitive position may be affected by its ability to protect its intellectual property rights  the company believes that trademark and copyright protections are less significant to the company s success than other factors  such as the knowledge  ability  and experience of the company s personnel  name recognition  and ongoing product development and support 
portions of the company s shrink wrap and or click through licenses may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions the company s software products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis pursuant to a perpetual license 
the company licenses its products to end users primarily under shrink wrap or click through license ie  licenses included as part of the product packaging or electronic delivery 
shrink wrap and click through licenses  which are not negotiated with or signed by individual end user licensees  are intended to take effect upon opening of the product package or agreeing to the terms electronically 
certain provisions of such licenses  including provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer  and disclosure of the licensed product  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement could adversely affect the business as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  the company believes that software products will increasingly become subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company and or against the company s suppliers of technology 
in general  the company s suppliers have agreed to indemnify the company in the event any such claim involves supplier provided software or technology  but any such claim  whether or not involving a supplier  could require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
the company depends upon licensing adequate technology from third parties the company depends on the availability of technology from third parties 
most of the software licensed by the company is written to comply with industry standards and because the licensor is seeking to broaden its market it is made widely available on a non exclusive basis by the licensor 
as a result  this software is also readily available to competitors of the company which want to incorporate such software into their products 
the loss of any significant third party license or the inability to license additional technology as required  could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations until such time as the company could replace such technology 
tax carryforwards as the company utilizes its tax carryforwards and as new tax legislation is enacted  the company s effective tax rate is subject to change 
the company s results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates substantial portions of the company s revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
trade sales to international customers represented  and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s revenues can be affected by general economic conditions in the united states  europe and other international markets 
the company s operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time 
however  the company s results of operations may be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the carrying amount of purchased software and technology licenses may be reduced due to the company s amortization policy the company s policy is to amortize purchased software and technology licenses using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
due to competitive pressures  it is reasonably possible that those estimates of anticipated future gross revenues  the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or both will be reduced significantly in the near future 
as a result  the carrying amount of the company s purchased software and technology licenses may be reduced materially in the near future and  therefore  could create an adverse impact on the company s future reported earnings 
the company may make future acquisitions where advisable and acquisitions involve numerous risks the company continually evaluates potential acquisition candidates 
such candidates are selected based on products or markets that are complementary to those of the company s 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the successful combination of the companies in an efficient and timely manner  the coordination of research and development and sales efforts  the retention of key personnel  the integration of the acquired products  the diversion of management s attention to assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  and the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
the company s operations and financial results could be significantly affected by such an acquisition 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in the market values of its portfolio of investments the company is exposed to equity price risk regarding the marketable portion of equity securities in its portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
this risk increased significantly after the completion of the transaction with caldera 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in the market values of portfolio investments 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
part of this portfolio includes minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
the company has also invested in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
the company could lose its entire initial investment in these companies 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure pertaining to these equity securities 
the company s success largely depends upon its ability to retain and recruit key personnel the company s continued success depends to a significant extent on senior management and other key employees 
none of these individuals is subject to a long term employment contract or a non competition agreement 
competition for qualified people in the software industry is intense 
the loss of one or more key employees or the company s inability to attract and retain other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s stock price may be volatile the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
in addition  factors such as new product introductions by the company or its competitors may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
furthermore  quarter to quarter fluctuations in the company s results of operations caused by changes in customer demand may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s stock 
these conditions  as well as factors which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods 
if the company fails to become euro compliant in a timely manner  it may result in an adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial position the single european currency euro was introduced on january  with complete transition to this new currency required by january we have made and expect to continue to make changes to our internal systems in preparation for the transition to the euro 
changes made to date include changing the operating currency of the european subsidiaries that are affected by the euro from the national currency to the euro  which became effective during fiscal we expect to complete the conversion of all financial aspects of these subsidiaries by december  we further expect that use of the euro may affect our foreign exchange activities and may result in increased fluctuations in foreign currency results 
any delays in our ability to be euro compliant could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative disclosures about market risk market rate sensitive instruments and risk management the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the following tables summarize the financial instruments held by the company at september  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the past the company used forward foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures associated with underlying assets  liabilities and anticipated transactions 
since the completion of the transaction in which the company sold the server software and professional services divisions to caldera international  the company does not feel the foreign exchange risk is great enough to warrant the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
in the normal course of business  the company also faces risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include technology risk  country risk  credit risk and legal risk  and are not represented in the following tables 
interest rate risk as of september  the company had cash and equivalents of million  consisting of cash and highly liquid money market instruments with maturities of less than days  and bank certificate of deposits of million 
because of the short maturities of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
the company would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest on our portfolio
