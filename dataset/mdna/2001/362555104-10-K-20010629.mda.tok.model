overview we are a provider of hardware and software products for storage area networks  or sans 
our san products are designed to leverage the capabilities of fibre channel technology to enable enterprises to better manage the growth of mission critical data by overcoming the limitations of the traditional captive storage architecture 
we sell our san products through leading oems  including hewlett packard company and compaq computer corporation 
we also sell our products through distribution channel partners such as bell microproducts  consan a gates arrow company and tech data corporation 
we were founded in april and initially developed electronic test equipment 
since october  we have focused on developing fibre channel network products that address the needs of the san market 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses  and as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million  and for the fiscal year ended march   our net loss was million 
we have not  and may never  achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and anticipate that we will incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses  and as a result  we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
we expect that a substantial majority of our net revenues for fiscal will be derived from new products currently under development or evaluation  including the slingshot if sales from new products are lower than expected or if we are unable to raise additional capital  including through a draw down under our equity line financing agreement  we will be required to make a significant reduction in operating expenses and capital expenditures in fiscal to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations through the end of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources 
on april   in an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of smartsan systems  inc  a california corporation smartsan 
we acquired smartsan by issuing  shares of its common stock in exchange for of the outstanding stock of smartsan and has agreed to issue  additional shares pursuant to the exercise of smartsan stock options outstanding at the time of the acquisition 
total consideration was as follows in thousands value of stock issued and options assumed  merger and other related costs paid in cash  total consideration  the allocation of the total consideration to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is as follows in thousands fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed acquired intangible assets and goodwill  in process research and development  at the time of the acquisition  we expensed approximately million of purchased in process research and development costs 
other purchased intangible assets  including goodwill  developed technology and other intangible assets of approximately million are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years on a straight line basis 
gadzoox amortized approximately million for fiscal year ended march  in the fourth quarter ended march   we decided to abandon the geminix product line purchased with smartsan 
in march  we expensed the remaining unamortized intangible assets of smartsan totaling million 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of a limited number of products within the same product line 
during fiscal  substantially all of our net revenues were derived from sales of our hub products  some of which are no longer sold 
we commenced commercial shipment of our capellix switch products during the quarter ended december  while sales of capellix during the quarters ended december  and march   were approximately and respectively  of net revenues  the majority of our net revenues in fiscal were generated from sales of our hub products 
during fiscal  approximately of our revenues came from sales of hub products and approximately from capellix switch products 
we expect that net revenues from switch products will account for a substantial majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the percentage of our net revenues derived from switch sales may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
additionally  we expect that a substantial majority of our net revenues for fiscal will be derived from new products currently under evaluation or development 
we may not be successful in our efforts to diversify our product base 
also  we may not be successful in the adoption of our new products  in particular our fibre channel fabric backbone switch  the slingshot product  or the adoption of other products currently under development 
additionally  even if our customers adopt the slingshot or other future products  we cannot assure you that our net revenues will increase 
see risk factors we have limited product offerings and our business may suffer if demand for any of these products declines or fails to develop as we expect and our business will suffer if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers 
we depend on a few key customers 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues came from hewlett packard company  compaq computer corporation and bell microproducts  inc with hewlett packard and compaq computer each accounting for or more of our net revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues came from four customers with sales to hewlett packard company  compaq computer corporation  bell microproducts  inc  and tokyo electron limited each accounting for more than of our net revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues came from sales to five customers with sales to hewlett packard company and compaq computer corporation each accounting for more than of our net revenues 
while we are seeking to diversify our customer base and expand the portion of our net revenues which are derived from sales through various channels  we anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on volume sales to a relatively small number of oem customers and distribution channel partners 
we may not be successful in our efforts to diversify our customer base 
see risk factors because we depend on a few key oem and distribution channel partners  the loss of any of these customers could significantly reduce our net revenues 
we believe net revenues derived from oem customers and distribution channel partners will continue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  approximately of our net revenues were derived from distribution channel partners and resellers 
during fiscal  net revenues derived from distribution channel partners were significantly lower than net revenues derived from oem customers 
although we have taken several actions to improve our distribution channel partners abilities to sell our products to end users  we cannot assure you that demand for our products through the distribution channel will increase 
if we are unable to increase sales through our distribution channel partners  our net revenues may continue to decline  and our business could be harmed 
see risk factors if our distribution channel partners are unable or unwilling to resell products  our net revenues will decrease and our business will be harmed  because we depend on a few key oem and distribution channel partners  the loss of any of these customers could significantly reduce our net revenues and the san market in which we compete is new and unpredictable  and if this market does not develop and expand as we anticipate  our business will suffer 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue net of appropriate reserves for sales returns when merchandise is shipped to distributors  to recognize revenue and related gross margin when the product is shipped by the distributor to end user 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy in fiscal was an increase in our net loss by million 
this change in accounting policy was made effective april  the company believes this change is preferable as it better recognizes the substance of demand for its products due to changes in the market place during fiscal year  and will accordingly better focus the company on  and allow investors to better understand end user demand trends for its products 
the company continues to record product net revenues to oems upon shipment and provides an allowance for product returns based on management s estimates 
allowances for estimated sales returns are provided at the time of revenue recognition 
our past product return experience may not be indicative of future product return rates 
our gross margins are affected by  among other factors  fluctuations in demand for our products  the mix of products sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  the timing and size of customer orders and product implementations  new product introductions both by us and by our competitors  product obsolescence  warranty and repair costs  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  component costs  and the volume manufacturing pricing we are able to obtain from our contract manufacturer 
we recognize higher gross margins from sales to distribution channel partners 
as a result  a decrease in sales to these customers will have a greater impact on gross margins than a decrease in sales to other customers 
see risk factors if we cannot increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset reductions in the average unit price of our products  our operating results may suffer 
although we enter into general sales contracts with our customers  none of our customers are obligated to purchase any amount of our products pursuant to these contracts 
we rely on our customers to submit purchase orders for specific quantities of our products 
all of our sales contracts contain provisions regarding the following products and pricing  order dates  rescheduling and cancellations  warranties and repair procedures  and marketing and or sales support and training obligations 
our oem contracts generally contain additional provisions regarding product technical specifications  labeling and boxing instructions and other customization instructions 
several of our oem sales contracts contain favored pricing provisions  as well as confidentiality provisions 
two of our oem sales contracts provide the oem the right to manufacture our product in the event of a material default we are unable to cure within a specified time period 
our contracts with our distribution channel partners generally contain additional provisions for stock rotation  which provide for a right of return for to of the value of purchases during the prior three months  to be offset with an immediately deliverable order in an amount equal to or greater than the stock to be rotated 
following our change in revenue recognition for distributors  revenue is only recognized when product is sold by the distributor to an end user  and stock rotation rights are not expected to materially impair future revenues 
we currently outsource substantially all of our manufacturing to sanmina corporation  a third party manufacturer 
our agreement with sanmina corporation provides for two months of rolling purchase orders and rolling forecasts for the nine months immediately following the purchase order period 
purchase prices are negotiable throughout the three year contract period 
we are liable for materials that sanmina corporation purchases on our behalf that we cannot use  cannot be cancelled before receipt or are unique parts otherwise unusable by sanmina corporation 
the agreement restricts our ability to reschedule orders and allows us to cancel existing orders subject to penalties of up to the total purchase price 
sanmina corporation provides warranties on workmanship and pass through warranties on component parts 
sanmina corporation purchases most of the key components used to manufacture our products 
we obtain some of these key components  such as our application specific integrated circuits  or asics  from sole sources and other components  such as power supplies and chassis  from limited sources 
if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  sanmina corporation may be unable to provide us with adequate manufacturing capacity 
in addition  sanmina corporation may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of components to meet our customers delivery requirements 
alternatively  excess inventories may be accumulated by sanmina corporation for our account 
in order to reduce the costs of sales  we relocated our manufacturing operations from sanmina corporation s manufacturing facility in santa clara  california to its manufacturing facility in guntersville  alabama during the second half of fiscal additionally  we may consider moving the outsourced manufacturing to other new locations or to a new contract manufacturer 
these relocations could be time consuming and expensive and there can be no assurance that such moves would not disrupt the manufacturing of our products 
such disruptions could cause us to lose net revenues and damage our customer relationships 
see risk factors we will be unable to manufacture or sell our products if our sole contract manufacturer is unable to meet our manufacturing needs  because we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components  we are susceptible to supply shortages that could adversely affect our operating results and because we order components and materials based on rolling forecasts  we may overestimate or underestimate our component and material requirements  which could increase our costs or prevent us from meeting customer demand 
results of operations the following table sets forth financial data for the fiscal years indicated as a percentage of net revenues year ended march  summary of operations data net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets in process research and development impairment of long lived assets restructuring and other expenses amortization of deferred compensation total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net of interest expense net loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net loss years ended march   and net revenues net revenues declined by million to million in fiscal  or from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues during fiscal was primarily due to lower sales of the gibraltar hub product line as well as the capellix switch product 
during fiscal  net revenues were million  an increase of over fiscal revenues of million 
net revenues for fiscal and increased over the respective prior year periods primarily due to a broadening of our product line  additions of new oem customers and increased sales through distribution channel partners 
in fiscal  we began commercial shipments of our capellix and capellix switch products  however the majority of our net revenues during this period were generated from sales of older hub products 
during fiscal we began selling our gibraltar port hub and denali switch 
sales to oems and distributors during fiscal represented approximately and of net revenues respectively with hewlett packard company and compaq corporation accounting for approximately of our net revenues 
sales to oems and distributors during fiscal represented approximately and respectively  with hewlett packard company  compaq corporation  bell microproducts  inc and tokyo electorn limited  accounting for approximately of our net revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues came from three customers with sales to hewlett packard  compaq computer corporation and digital equipment corporation each accounting for more than of our net revenues 
during fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by the sale of our capellix switch products and approximately from the sale of hub products compared to and in fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  of our revenues were derived from the sale of our hub products 
revenues by geographic area during fiscal were from north america  from europe and from asia 
during fiscal  these percentages were approximately from north america  from europe and from asia and in fiscal  from north america  from europe and from asia 
net revenues during fiscal years  and may not be indicative of future results 
in fiscal  we expect that a substantial majority of our net revenues will come from the sale of new products currently under evaluation or development  including our fibre channel fabric backbone switch  the slingshot we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce the slingshot or other new products successfully and in the time frame we expect or that these products will be adopted by our oem and distribution channel partners  or that significant net revenues would be derived if so adopted 
see part ii risk factors we have limited product offerings and our business may suffer if demand for any of these products declines or fails to develop as we expect and our business will suffer if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers 
gross margins gross margins decreased in absolute dollars by million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  production cancellation penalties as a result of lower than expected revenues and discontinued product development efforts 
also contributing to the decrease in gross margin to a much lesser degree is lower sales volumes to distribution channel partners  for which gross margins are typically higher than oem customers  and between fiscal and fiscal change product mix 
during fiscal approximately of our net revenues were derived from sales to distributors and resellers compared with approximately in fiscal between fiscal and fiscal the gross margin increased by million 
as a percentage of net revenues  the gross margin increased from of sales in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the following a greater percentage of our net revenues were derived from higher gross margin sales to distribution customers  a greater percentage of our net revenues were derived from sales of higher margin new products  such as the capellix switch  and higher sales volumes which resulted in economies of scale and cost savings realized from our transition to sanmina corporation for contract manufacturing 
our gross margins could decrease if sales to distribution channel partners decrease  if sales of our newer products are not adopted by the marketplace  if sales volumes decrease due to lower overall demand and if the company were to experience increased price competition 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal these increases were primarily due to additional research and development personnel  including the addition of our strategic research and development team and our two asic development teams primarily devoted to our development of new products including the capellix and slingshot family of switch products 
in fiscal research and development expenses were approximately of sales compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we believe that a significant level of investment for product research and development is required to remain competitive 
accordingly  we continue to devote substantial resources to product research and development efforts and expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer engineering support functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows  promotional activities and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal between fiscal and fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased by from million to million 
the increased spending in each of these years was primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
during fiscal  the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to increased staffing and increased activities for the capellix line  including joint seminar  tradeshow and advertising activities with key oems  alliance and distribution partners worldwide 
we intend to expand our sales and marketing operations and efforts substantially  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase market awareness of our products and more effectively train and educate our distribution channel partners and end users 
however  we cannot be certain that any increased expenditures will result in higher net revenues 
we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees and costs associated with expanding our information systems 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  and by during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase during fiscal and and between fiscal and was primarily attributable to increased personnel  additional expenses incurred related to the growth of our business  expansion of our facilities and information infrastructure and our operation as a public company 
we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business  expansion of our information infrastructure and our operation as a public company 
amortization of deferred compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  during fiscal  we recorded deferred compensation within stockholders equity of approximately million  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million during fiscal years  and respectively 
at march   the remaining deferred compensation of approximately million will be amortized as follows million in fiscal and 
million in fiscal the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all operating expense categories 
the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
see note of the notes to the financial statements 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of smartsan systems  inc smartsan in april  we amortized purchased intangible assets  including goodwill  developed technology and other intangible assets of approximately million over their estimated useful lives of five years on a straight line basis 
for fiscal the company amortized million of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company wrote off the remaining million of goodwill and reported this as a separate line item on its statement of operation 
see restructuring and impairment charges 
in process research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of smartsan  the company expensed approximately million as in process research and development costs which represented approximately of the purchase price and was attributable and supported by an analysis that identified revenue and costs on a project by project basis 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology  based on a discounted cash flow method  was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established 
as of the acquisition date  in process projects consisted of the geminix router and two other router products 
the value of in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate included a risk adjusted discount rate to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology and the completeness of each product at the time of the acquisition 
a discount rate of was used 
the percentage complete calculations for all products were estimated based on research and development expenses incurred to date and management s estimates of remaining development costs which do not differ materially from historical amounts 
at the date of acquisition  the geminix router and the two other products under development were determined to be  and complete  respectively 
restructuring and impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we executed our plan to focus more resources on the development of open fabric switch technology products and to restructure our business operations 
this resulted in the termination and abandonment of the axxess and geminix product lines  reduction of personnel and consolidation of all san jose  california operations in one building 
in connection with this restructuring  the company recorded expenses of approximately million and an additional expense of million relating to the impairment of long term assets  primarily relating to the write off of the remaining goodwill and intangibles that arose from the smartsan acquisition which was completed in april see note of the notes to the financial statements 
interest income  net of interest expense interest income  net of interest expense  related to our debt and lease obligations  includes income from our cash investments  net of expenses related to our financing obligations 
interest income  net of interest expense  totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and interest expense  net of interest income  of million in fiscal the decrease in interest income  net of interest expense  in fiscal was primarily the result of lower cash levels due to the higher operating loss as well as increased working capital and capital spending  offset in part by lower interest expense due to the repayment of the outstanding convertible notes to seagate technology  inc see note of the notes to the financial statements 
the increase of net interest income during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to interest income earned from investment of the net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock from our initial public offering in july  and by lower interest expense charged on the convertible note due to partial conversion of the note in connection with our initial public offering 
this increase was partially offset by increased interest expense charged on higher capital lease obligations 
during fiscal interest expense  net of interest income  was primarily due to accrued interest on the convertible note  as well as  interest expense charged on our capital lease obligations 
income taxes as of march   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes available to offset future taxable income 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively 
such net operating and research credit loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of loss carryforwards for these periods or for any other periods since inception because management s estimate of the realizability of the tax benefits of the loss carryforwards indicates that the underlying assumptions of future profitable operations contain risks that do not provide sufficient assurance for us to recognize such benefits currently 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock  convertible preferred stock  the issuance of a convertible note  equipment lease financings and an initial public offering of common stock 
at march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and in net working capital  a decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease of million in net working capital from the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  the company used million in cash for operating needs  an increase of million from fiscal this increase was primarily due to the higher than anticipated net loss as a result of lower sales of new and existing products and higher operating expenses coupled with higher working capital needs 
additionally  during fiscal  we generated million in cash from investing activities  primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of short term investments of million  offset in part by the purchase of capital equipment of million and million used for the purchase of long term investments and the acquisition of smartsan 
net cash used by financing activities during fiscal amounted to approximately million 
approximately million was used to pay the remaining balance due on the convertible note payable to seagate technology  inc  other notes payable acquired from with smartsan and capital equipment lease obligations 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan generated approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  we used million in cash for operating needs  a decrease of from million used in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our net loss from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal  we used million in cash from investing activities to acquire property and equipment 
additionally  we invested million of the proceeds from our initial public offering during fiscal in short term investments 
in fiscal  we generated million in cash from financing activities including the sale of our equity  an increase of from million generated in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in july additionally  we used debt and leases to partially finance operations and capital purchases and we plan to continue this practice 
we expect to devote substantial cash resources to continue our research and development efforts  to hire and expand our sales  support  marketing and product development organizations  to expand marketing programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and for other general corporate activities 
we incurred a net loss in the year ended march  of million and have an accumulated deficit of million as of march  we have continuously incurred net losses from operations and used million of cash in operations for the year ended march   and have working capital of million as of march  in may  we sold million shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction for net proceeds of approximately million 
on june   we entered into an equity line financing agreement  or equity line  with societe generale pursuant to which the company has the right to elect to sell and societe generale has the obligation to purchase up to million of the company s common stock 
pursuant to the terms of the equity line  the company  from time to time  during the two year period beginning on june   can elect to sell which election is referred to as a draw down a specific dollar amount of its common stock based upon the price and trading volume of its common stock during the thirty trading days prior to a draw down 
the price per share and the actual number of shares sold by the company pursuant to each draw down will be determined by the price and volume of trading in the company s common stock during the five trading days following the day that the company notifies societe generale of the draw down  provided that in no event will the price per share be less than the higher of and the price set by the company in its notice of election to make a draw upon the equity line 
under the terms of the equity line agreement  the company is obligated to sell at least million of common stock to societe generale or pay a penalty equal to of any portion of such million minimum obligation which is not sold by the company 
the company cannot sell more than  shares of common stock pursuant to the equity line without first obtaining stockholder approval 
the company also is obligated in connection with the equity line to file a registration statement registering the sale by societe generale of any shares sold by the company 
if this registration statement is not declared effective within days of june   then societe generale shall have the right to terminate the equity line  in which event the company shall be obligated to pay the penalty described above 
the company s ability to sell shares of its common stock under the equity line is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the equity line agreement  including  but not limited to  i the requirement that the price per share of the company s common stock remain higher than a specified minimum price during the five trading days following the company s election to draw upon the equity line  ii the absence of any material adverse change in the business or financial condition of the company  iii the continued effectiveness of the registration statement covering the sale of shares by societe generale and the absence of any material omission or misstatement from the then current prospectus relating to the registration statement and iv the delivery of certain letters and reports from the company s counsel and accountants 
the equity line prohibits societe generale from selling shares of the company s common stock during the term of the equity line other than a number of shares equal to the amount of any draw down by the company divided by of the minimum selling price specified in the company s draw down election 
consequently  societe generale may have the ability to sell substantially more shares of common stock following a draw down election than it is obligated to purchase in connection with the draw down  which may result in an immediate and significant drop in the company s stock price and a significant increase in the number of shares issued by the company pursuant to a draw down 
accordingly  the company s use of the equity line for financing may result in substantial dilution to the company s stockholders and a significant decline in the company s stock price 
we believe that our cash reserves  working capital and the funds available under the equity line agreement will be adequate to fund our operations through the end of fiscal however  as discussed above  the company s right to sell shares under the equity line agreement is subject to a number of conditions and we may not be able to sell our shares of common stock under the equity line agreement when we wish or need 
if we are unable to sell our shares of common stock under the equity line agreement  we will be required to raise additional funds to continue to operate our business 
many companies in the high technology manufacturing industry have experienced difficulty raising additional financing in recent months 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
even if additional financing is available  we may be required to obtain the consent of our stockholders  which we may not be able to obtain 
if additional financing is not available  we may need to dramatically change our business plan  sell or merge our business  or face bankruptcy 
in addition  the issuance of equity or equity related securities will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of the company 
our cash needs depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of and demand for our switch products  particularly new products currently under evaluation or development  including the slingshot  our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  prices at which we can sell our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  increases in manufacturing costs and the prices of the components we purchase and other factors 
in fiscal a substantial majority of our revenues are expected to be derived from the sale of new products currently under evaluation or development  including the slingshot we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce the slingshot or other new products successfully and in the time frame we expect or that these products will be adopted by our oem and distribution channel partners  or that significant net revenues would be derived if so adopted 
see risk factors we have limited product offerings and our business may suffer if demand for any of these products declines or fails to develop as we expect and our business will suffer if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the changing needs or our customers 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  including through a draw down under the equity line  or if sales from new products are lower than expected  we will be required to make a significant reduction in operating expenses and capital expenditures in fiscal to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations through the end of fiscal additionally  we may do one or more of the following engage a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives  which may include a merger  asset sale  or another comparable transaction  raise additional capital to fund continuing operations by private placements of equity and or debt securities  and form a joint venture with a strategic partner or partners to provide additional capital resources to fund operations 
in addition to the foregoing  we are attempting to reduce our financial commitments and reduce future cash outflows by negotiating alternative terms with our suppliers 
in addition  cost cutting measures could include additional reductions in force 
further  we are working with our channel partners to increase revenues through new marketing programs and promotions  and are exploring potential additional sources of revenue 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in increasing revenues or reducing cash outflows 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
 which is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
because the company does not currently hold any derivative instruments and does not currently engage in any material hedging activities  management believes that the application of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this form k 
risks and uncertainties  in addition to those we describe below  that are not presently known to us  or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks 
we have incurred net losses in every fiscal year and fiscal quarter since our inception and the failure to raise additional capital resources will have a material adverse effect on our business 
we incurred a net loss in the year ended march  of million and have an accumulated deficit of million as of march  we have continuously incurred net losses from operations and used million of cash in operations for the year ended march   and have working capital of million as of march  in may  we sold million shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction for net proceeds of approximately million 
on june   we entered into an equity line financing agreement  or equity line  with societe generale pursuant to which the company has the right to elect to sell and societe generale has the obligation to purchase up to million of the company s common stock 
pursuant to the terms of the equity line  the company  from time to time  during the two year period beginning on june   can elect to sell which election is referred to as a draw down a specific dollar amount of its common stock based upon the price and trading volume of its common stock during the thirty trading days prior to a draw down 
the company s ability to sell shares of its common stock under the equity line is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the equity line agreement  including  but not limited to  i the requirement that the price per share of the company s common stock remain higher than a specified minimum price during the five trading days following the company s election to draw upon the equity line  ii the absence of any material adverse change in the business or financial condition of the company  iii the continued effectiveness of the registration statement covering the sale of shares by societe generale and the absence of any material omission or misstatement from the then current prospectus relating to the registration statement and iv the delivery of certain letters and reports from the company s counsel and accountants 
the equity line prohibits societe generale from selling shares of the company s common stock during the term of the equity line other than a number of shares equal to the amount of any draw down by the company divided by of the minimum selling price specified in the company s draw down election 
consequently  societe generale may have the ability to sell substantially more shares of common stock following a draw down election than it is obligated to purchase in connection with the draw down  which may result in an immediate and significant drop in the company s stock price and a significant increase in the number of shares issued by the company pursuant to a draw down 
accordingly  the company s use of the equity line for financing may result in substantial dilution to the company s stockholders and a significant decline in the company s stock price 
see management s discussion and analysis and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we believe that our cash reserves  working capital and the funds available under the equity line agreement will be adequate to fund our operations through the end of fiscal however  as discussed above  the company s right to sell shares under the equity line agreement is subject to a number of conditions and we may not be able to sell our shares of common stock under the equity line agreement when we wish or need 
if we are unable to sell our shares of common stock under the equity line agreement  we will be required to raise additional funds to continue to operate our business 
many companies in the high technology manufacturing industry have experienced difficulty raising additional financing in recent months 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
even if additional financing is available  we may be required to obtain the consent of our stockholders  which we may not be able to obtain 
if additional financing is not available  we may need to dramatically change our business plan  sell or merge our business  or face bankruptcy 
in addition  the issuance of equity or equity related securities will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of the company 
our cash needs depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of and demand for our switch products  particularly new products currently under evaluation or development  including the slingshot  our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  prices at which we can sell our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  increases in manufacturing costs and the prices of the components we purchase and other factors 
in fiscal a substantial majority of our revenues are expected to be derived from the sale of new products currently under evaluation or development  including the slingshot we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce the slingshot or other new products successfully and in the time frame we expect or that these products will be adopted by our oem and distribution channel partners  or that significant net revenues would be derived if so adopted 
see risk factors we have limited product offerings and our business may suffer if demand for any of these products declines or fails to develop as we expect and our business will suffer if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the changing needs or our customers 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  including through a draw down under the equity line  or if sales from new products are lower than expected  we will be required to make a significant reduction in operating expenses and capital expenditures in fiscal to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations through the end of fiscal additionally  we may do one or more of the following engage a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives  which may include a merger  asset sale  or another comparable transaction  raise additional capital to fund continuing operations by private placements of equity and or debt securities  and form a joint venture with a strategic partner or partners to provide additional capital resources to fund operations 
in addition to the foregoing  we are attempting to reduce our financial commitments and reduce future cash outflows by negotiating alternative terms with our suppliers 
in addition  cost cutting measures could include additional reductions in force 
further  we are working with our channel partners to increase revenues through new marketing programs and promotions  and are exploring potential additional sources of revenue 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in increasing revenues or reducing cash outflows 
our recent equity line financing may cause a significant dilution to our stockholders and a significant decline in our stock price 
the equity line prohibits societe generale from selling shares of the company s common stock during the term of the equity line other than a number of shares equal to the amount of any draw down by the company divided by of the minimum selling price specified in the company s draw down election 
consequently  societe generale may have the ability to sell substantially more shares of common stock following a draw down election than it is obligated to purchase in connection with the draw down  which may result in an immediate and significant drop in the company s stock price and a significant increase in the number shares issued by the company pursuant to a draw down 
accordingly  the company s use of the equity line for financing may result in substantial dilution to the company s stockholders and a significant decline in the company s stock price 
we have limited product offerings and our business may suffer if demand for any of these products declines or fails to develop as we expect 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products 
specifically  in fiscal  the majority of our net revenues were derived from our hub products 
however  we expect that net revenues from our switch products will account for a substantial majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future 
additionally  we expect that a substantial majority of our net revenues for fiscal will be derived from new products currently under evaluation or development  including our fibre channel fabric backbone switch  the slingshot there is no assurance that the slingshot  or any other newly developed product will be adopted by our oem or distribution channel partners or that significant net revenues would be derived if adopted 
as a result  for the foreseeable future  we will continue to be subject to the risk of a significant decrease in net revenues if demand for our switch products decline 
therefore  continued market acceptance of our switch products is critical to our future success 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include the following growth and changing requirements of the san hubs and switch product markets  availability  price  quality and performance of competing products and technologies  performance  quality  price and total cost of ownership of our products  and  successful development of our relationships with existing and potential oem customers and distribution channel partners 
we have incurred significant losses in every fiscal year and fiscal quarter since our inception and we may never become profitable 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses on both a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
as of march   our accumulated deficit was million 
we may never realize sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
we also expect to incur significant product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to generate increased net revenues to achieve profitability 
further  even if we achieve profitability  given the competition in  and the evolving nature of the storage area networking market  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we executed on our plan to focus more resources on the development of open fabric switch technology products and to restructure our business operations 
this resulted in the termination and abandonment of the axxess and geminix product lines  reduction of personnel and consolidation of all san jose  california operations in one building 
in connection with this restructuring  the company recorded expenses of approximately million and an additional expense of million relating to the impairment of long term assets  primarily relating to the write off of the remaining goodwill and intangibles that arose from the smartsan acquisition which was completed in april see note of the notes to the financial statements 
due to our limited operating history  we may have difficulty accurately predicting revenue for future periods and appropriately budgeting for expenses  and  because most our expenses are fixed in the short term  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
we have generated net revenues for less than seven years and  thus  we have only a short history from which to predict future net revenues 
during the past three years  our revenues have varied significantly 
additionally  we expect that most of our net revenues for fiscal will be derived from new products under evaluation and development 
this limited operating experience  combined with the rapidly evolving nature of the san market in which we sell our products and our reliance on new product sales reduces our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly and annual revenue 
further  we plan our operating expenses based primarily on our revenue projections 
because most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue 
for example  during the fiscal year  orders from our distribution channel partners were lower than expected due to decreased sell through to end user customers which resulted in a corresponding decrease in net revenues 
additionally  in july  digital equipment corporation cancelled orders for our bitstrip product  which resulted in a corresponding decrease in net revenues 
if a similar situation were to occur in the future  we may incur additional unexpected losses which could seriously harm our business 
for further financial information relating to our business  see notes to financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have a history of quarterly and annual fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results  and expect these fluctuations to continue  which may result in volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly and annual net revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
the primary factors that may cause our quarterly net revenues and operating results to fluctuate include the following fluctuations in demand for our products and services  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements  the ability and willingness of our distribution channel partners to sell our products  the timing of customer orders and product implementations  particularly large orders from our customers  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors and deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products  services or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  decreases in the prices at which we can sell our products  the rate of adoption of sans as an alternative to existing data storage and management systems  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of components  including sole or limited source components  at expected prices  the mix of our hubs and switch products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  increases in the prices of the components we purchase  our ability to maintain quality manufacturing standards for our products  competitive technology developments which may decrease the demand for products based on the technology we utilize  our ability to maintain  increase or quickly decrease the contract production of our products at expected prices  and the mix of our hubs  switches  software and other products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any past periods as an indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future periods  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  our stock price may drop 
because we depend on a few key oem and distribution channel partners  the loss of any of these customers could significantly reduce our net revenues 
we depend on a few key oem and distribution channel partners 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues came from three customers with sales to hewlett packard company and compaq computer corporation each accounting for or more of our net revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues came from four customers with sales to hewlett packard company  compaq computer corporation  bell microproducts  inc and tokyo electron limited each accounting for more than of our net revenues 
although we intend to expand our original equipment manufacture customer base  we anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers 
none of our current customers have any minimum purchase obligations  and they may stop placing orders with us at any time  regardless of any forecast they may have previously provided 
the loss of any of our key customers  or a significant reduction in sales to those customers  could significantly reduce our net revenues 
for example  net revenues for the year ended march  were significantly lower than expectations as a result of a decline in orders from our distribution channel partners due to a decline in sell through to end user customers 
this decline contributed to the substantial decrease in net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  in july  digital equipment corporation cancelled orders for our bitstrip product  and in december  hewlett packard company unexpectedly reduced orders for our gibraltar port product 
digital equipment corporation s order cancellation resulted in a reduction of anticipated net revenues by approximately for the fiscal year ended march  if our distribution channel partners are unable or unwilling to resell our products  our net revenues will decrease and our business will be harmed 
during fiscal  approximately of our net revenues were derived from sales to distribution channel partners and resellers 
our oem customers have demonstrated the ability to resell our san products due  in part  to the length of time they have been involved in the san marketplace and the strength of their internal technical  sales and marketing structures 
our distribution channel partners have participated in the san market for a shorter period of time and often do not have fully trained technical  sales and marketing staff 
as a result  they are not as well positioned as our oem customers to provide full solution sales 
additionally  distribution channel partners may not be able to effectively compete with oems 
although we have taken several actions to improve our distribution channel partners abilities to sell our products to end users  we can not assure you that demand for our products through the distribution channel will increase 
if we are unable to effectively leverage sales through our distribution channel partners  our net revenues may continue to decline  and our business would be harmed 
the inability or unwillingness of our distribution channel partners to resell san networking equipment  including full san solutions  would significantly reduce our net revenues which would harm our business 
our reliance on oem customers and distribution channel partners and the lengthy process required to add these partners may impede the growth of our net revenues 
we rely on oem customers and distribution channel partners to distribute and sell our products 
as a result  our success depends substantially on our ability to initiate  manage and expand our relationships with significant oem customers  our ability to attract distribution channel partners that are able and willing to sell our products and the sales efforts of these oem customers and distribution channel partners 
our oem customers typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they begin to market and sell new technologies  including our products 
based on our experience with our larger oem customers  this evaluation process is lengthy and has historically been as long as nine months 
this process is also complex and may require significant sales  marketing and management efforts on our part 
the complexity of this process increases if we must qualify our products with multiple customers at the same time 
in addition  once our products have been qualified  the length of the sales cycle of each of our oem customers may vary depending upon whether our products are being bundled with another product or are being sold as an option or add on 
sales to distribution channel partners may also require lengthy sales and marketing cycles 
additionally  to increase sales through the distribution channel  we have made significant investments in activities designed to improve sell through at the end user level 
as a result  we may expend significant resources in developing partner relationships before recognizing any revenue 
we may not be able to manage and expand our relationships with oem customers and distribution channel partners successfully and they may not market our products successfully 
moreover  our agreements with oem customers and distribution channel partners have no minimum purchase commitments 
our failure to manage and expand our relationships with oem customers and distribution channel partners or their failure to market our products could substantially reduce our net revenues and seriously harm our business 
our business may be harmed by class action litigation due to stock price volatility 
on june  the company and three former officers were named defendants in a putative securities class action lawsuit 
see part i item legal proceedings 
securities class action litigation often is brought against a company due to volatility in the market price of its securities 
the market price of our securities has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
therefore  we may in the future be the target of additional securities litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
the san market in which we compete is new and unpredictable  and if this market does not develop and expand as we anticipate  our business will suffer 
the market for san hubs and switch products has only recently begun to develop and is rapidly evolving 
because the san market is new  it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate 
our products are used exclusively in sans 
accordingly  widespread adoption of sans as an integral part of data intensive enterprise computing environments is critical to our future success 
potential end user customers who have invested substantial resources in their existing data storage and management systems may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach  like sans 
the speed at which customers adopt current and new products for sans is highly unpredictable 
our success in generating net revenues in this emerging market will depend on  among other things  our ability to educate potential oem customers  distribution channel partners and end users about the benefits of sans hub and switch technology  maintain and enhance our relationships with leading oem customers and channel partners  predict and base our products on standards which ultimately become industry standards  and  predict and deliver new and innovative products demanded by the storage area marketplace 
in addition  sans are often implemented in connection with deployment of new storage systems and servers 
accordingly  our future success is also substantially dependent on the market for new storage systems and servers 
our business will suffer if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers 
our future success depends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing san market  including changes in relevant industry standards and the changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing high quality  technologically progressive  cost effective products  product enhancements and services on a timely basis 
we expect that a substantial majority of our net revenues for fiscal will be derived from new products currently under evaluation and development  including the slingshot fibre channel fabric switch 
we expect to commence commercial shipments of the slingshot during the september quarter 
our future net revenue growth will be dependent on the success of the slingshot and other new products  and we may not be able to develop and introduce the slingshot or other new products successfully in the time frame we expect 
we have  in the past  experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future 
further  we cannot be certain of the demand for  and market acceptance of  the slingshot and other new products 
see part ii risk factors we have limited product offerings and our business may suffer if demand for any of these products declines or fails to develop as we expect  for factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  we must successfully manage the introduction of new or enhanced products to minimize disruption in our customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet our customers demands 
our net revenues will be reduced if we fail to develop product enhancements  if we fail to introduce new products  or if any new products or product enhancements that we develop and introduce are not broadly accepted 
competing technologies may emerge and we may fail to adopt new technologies on a timely basis 
our failure to utilize new technologies may decrease the demand for our new products 
the technology being deployed today in most san products is fc al or fc sw 
during the last fiscal year  the development of competing technologies such as ethernet ip has been discussed by the technical community 
if we are unable to identify new technologies in a timely manner and efficiently utilize such new technologies in our product developments  the demand for our current products may decrease significantly and rapidly  which would harm our business 
we will be unable to manufacture or sell our products if our sole contract manufacturer is unable to meet our manufacturing needs 
sanmina corporation or  sanmina  a third party manufacturer for numerous companies  manufactures all of our products at its facility in guntersville  alabama 
sanmina is not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  or in any specific quantity  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order which has been accepted by sanmina 
if sanmina experiences delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations  then product shipments to our customers could be delayed  which would negatively impact our net revenues and our competitive position and reputation 
further  our business would be harmed if we fail to effectively manage the manufacture of our products 
we generally place orders with sanmina at least two months prior to scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
accordingly  if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from sanmina or adequate quantities of components to meet our customers delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories 
in the future we intend to work with additional new contract manufacturers that can potentially manufacture our higher volume products  at lower costs in foreign locations 
we could experience difficulties and disruptions in the manufacture of our products while we transition to new facilities 
manufacturing disruptions could prevent us from achieving timely delivery of products and could result in lost net revenues 
additionally  we must coordinate our efforts with those of our suppliers  sanmina  or other third party manufacturers  to rapidly achieve volume production 
although we have not experienced supply problems with sanmina  we have experienced delays in product deliveries from one of our former contract manufacturers 
moreover  we may in the future need to find a new contract manufacturer that can manufacture our products in higher volume and at lower costs 
we may not find a contract manufacturer that meets our needs 
additionally  qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
if we are required or decide to change contract manufacturers  we may lose net revenues and our customer relationships may suffer 
because we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components  we are susceptible to supply shortages that could adversely affect our operating results 
we depend upon a single source for each type of our application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and limited sources of supply for several key components  including  but not limited to  power supplies  chassis and optical transceivers 
we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience shortages of  or difficulties in acquiring  these components 
we rely on sanmina to procure components required for the manufacture of our products 
sanmina may suffer component shortages 
if we or sanmina are unable to buy these components  we will not be able to manufacture our products on a timely basis which would harm our business 
because we order components and materials based on rolling forecasts  we may overestimate or underestimate our component and material requirements  which could increase our costs and thereby negatively impact our operating results  or prevent us from meeting customer demand 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
as a result  our component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
our operating results may suffer because of competition in the san market  as well as additional competition from data networking companies and enterprise software developers 
the market for our san hub and switch products is competitive  and is likely to become even more competitive 
in the san switch market  our current competitors include brocade communications systems  inc  mcdata corporation  q logic corporation and vixel corporation 
in the san hub market  our competitors include emulex corporation and vixel corporation 
in addition to these companies  we expect new san competitors to emerge 
in the future  we may also compete against data networking companies which may develop san products 
furthermore  although we currently offer products that complement the software products offered by legato systems  inc and veritas software corporation  they and other enterprise software developers may in the future compete with us 
we also compete with providers of data storage solutions that employ traditional storage technologies  including small computer system interface based technology such as adaptec  inc  lsi logic corporation and qlogic corporation 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced sales  reduced margins  reduced profits  reduced market share or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  more established distribution channels or substantially greater resources than we have 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
moreover  we have only recently begun to offer san switch products 
therefore  we may not be able to compete successfully in the san switch product market 
if we cannot increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset reductions in the average unit price of our products  our operating results may suffer 
we anticipate that as products in the storage area market become more commoditized  the average unit price of our products will continue to decline in the future in response to changes in product mix  competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
if we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  our net revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
further  as average unit prices of our current products decline  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins 
if we cannot maintain our gross margins  our business could be seriously harmed  particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors  which could lead to an increase in our costs or a reduction in our net revenues 
networking products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products are complex and we have from time to time found errors in existing products  and we may from time to time find errors in our existing  new or enhanced products 
in addition  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our or other vendors san products  could adversely affect sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relationship problems 
if we do not hire  retain and integrate highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  finance and operations personnel  our business may suffer 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key personnel in engineering  sales  marketing  finance and operations  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on most of our key personnel and do not have employment contracts with any of our key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a negative impact on our business 
we also believe that our success depends to a significant extent on the ability of our key personnel to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
many of our key employees and other employees have only recently joined us 
our chief executive officer has held that position for less than one year 
our vice president of marketing  vice president of sales and vice president of human resources have been with us for less than one year and our chief financial officer has been with us for approximately one month 
if we are unable to integrate new employees in a timely and cost effective manner  our operating results may suffer 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  finance and operations personnel  including executive officers 
competition for these people is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area where our operations are headquartered 
in particular  we have experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified asic  software  system  test and customer support engineers and executive staff and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining individuals to fill these positions 
if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or if we experience delays in hiring required personnel  particularly qualified engineers and sales personnel  our ability to develop  introduce and sell our products could be harmed 
in addition  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
any claim of this nature could result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth  and if we are not able to successfully manage this and future growth  our business may suffer 
we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth 
at march   we had a total of employees  and at march   we had a total of employees 
we plan to continue to hire new employees to expand our operations significantly to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this growth will place a significant demand on our management and our operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
our key personnel have limited experience managing this type of growth 
if we cannot manage growth effectively  our business could suffer 
because our intellectual property is critical to the success of our business  our operating results would suffer if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
because our products rely on proprietary technology and will likely continue to rely on technological advancements for market acceptance  we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights will be critical to the success of our business 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property from infringement  other companies may be able to use our intellectual property to offer competitive products at lower prices 
we may not be able to effectively compete against these companies 
we rely heavily on our intellectual property  and efforts to protect it  may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation which would seriously harm our business 
although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation  we may be a party to litigation in the future either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
these claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could cause our proprietary rights to be invalidated 
litigation  regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following stop using the challenged intellectual property or selling our products or services that incorporate it  obtain a license to use the challenged intellectual property or to sell products or services that incorporate it  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  and redesign those products or services that are based on or incorporate the challenged intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products  and our net revenues would be substantially reduced 
industry standards and government regulations affecting our business evolve rapidly  and if we cannot develop products that are compatible with these evolving standards  our business will suffer 
our products must comply with industry standards 
for example  in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission 
internationally  our products are also required to comply with standards established by authorities in various countries 
any new products and product enhancements that we introduce in the future must also meet industry standards at the time they are introduced 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could materially harm our business 
our products comprise only a part of the entire san market 
all components of the san must comply with the same standards in order to operate efficiently together 
we depend on companies that provide other components of the san to support the industry standards as they evolve 
many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in effecting industry standards than we are 
some industry standards may not be widely adopted or they may not be implemented uniformly  and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by oem customers or end users 
if other companies do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge  market acceptance of our products could suffer 
we plan to increase our international sales activities which will subject us to additional business risks 
for the fiscal year ended march   approximately of our net revenues were from international sales activities  and for the fiscal year ended march   approximately of our net revenues were from international sales activities 
our international sales will be limited if we cannot establish relationships with international distributors  establish additional foreign operations  expand international sales channel management  hire additional personnel and develop relationships with international service providers 
even if we are able to successfully continue international operations  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including multiple protectionist  adverse and changing governmental laws and regulations  reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights  potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws  and political and economic instability 
to date  none of our international net revenues and costs have been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
a portion of our international net revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which would subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in those foreign currencies 
we may become involved in costly and time consuming litigation that may substantially increase our costs and thereby harm our business 
we may from time to time become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in any such matter could harm our business 
see part i item legal proceedings 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders equity and cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities 
as part of our strategy  we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our market or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in april  we completed our acquisition of smartsan systems  inc as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock and agreed to issue  shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of smartsan options outstanding at the time of the acquisition 
while we have no additional current agreements or negotiations underway  we may buy businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future purchases  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  or assume liabilities 
these purchases could also involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might purchase in the future 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  requiring super majority voting to effect significant amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
certain provisions of delaware law also may discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of march   all of our investments were in cash and cash equivalents 
see note of the notes to the financial statements 
the following table details our short term investments and cash and cash equivalents at march  and in thousands march  us government agencies  corporate bonds and notes   money market funds and available cash   total
