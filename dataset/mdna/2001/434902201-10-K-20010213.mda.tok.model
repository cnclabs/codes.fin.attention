general we are a multi store dealership chain engaged in the retail sales  financing  and service of recreation vehicles  or rvs  boats and other recreation vehicles 
currently  we operate retail centers  five in central and north central florida  two in the gulf coast areas of tampa and ft 
myers  florida  one in spartanburg  south carolina  two in california s central valley cities of roseville and bakersfield  one in las cruces  new mexico  one in prosperity west virginia  one in wytheville  virginia  and one in lexington  kentucky 
our growth depends primarily on our ability to acquire new stores 
we intend to capitalize on the anticipated demand and upon the consolidation opportunities available in the highly fragmented rv industry by acquiring additional dealers and improving their performance and profitability through the implementation of our operating strategies 
our primary acquisition focus is on well established rv and marine dealers with strong leadership roles in key geographic markets with strong demographics 
we are also considering opportunities within our existing markets when operating and marketing efficiencies can be obtained by the addition of more dealerships 
we may expand our range of product lines and our market penetration by acquiring dealers that distribute rv product lines different from those currently offered by us 
we intend to grow rapidly in fiscal  primarily through the acquisition of rv dealerships 
our growth strategy involves significant risks 
we began our growth strategy in fiscal by acquiring seven dealerships 
during fiscal  we made three acquisitions 
the first acquisition occurred on november   when we acquired county line select cars  inc  an ocala  florida based four dealership rv sales and service company 
prior to the acquisition  county line s annual revenue was approximately million 
the second acquisition occurred on march   when we acquired little valley rv sales  inc  a two dealership rv sales and service company  with one dealership located in prosperity  west virginia  and the other located in wytheville  virginia 
prior to the acquisition  little valley s annual revenue was approximately million 
the final acquisition occurred on october   when we acquired hall enterprises  inc  a one dealership sales and service company in lexington  kentucky 
prior to the acquisition  hall s annual revenue was approximately million 
during october we signed agreements to acquire two additional dealerships 
on october   we signed an agreement to purchase emerald coast rv center  inc  the largest independent full service retailer on the gulf coast with annual revenue in excess of million 
the addition of emerald coast s four dealerships in florida and alabama will strengthen our presence in the southeast market 
on october   we signed a definitive agreement  subject to due diligence  to purchase village rv  inc  one of the largest independent  full service rv dealerships in california with annual revenues of approximately million 
acquisitions have a significant effect on our operating results and financial position and cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
we have accounted for all of our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  do not include in our financial statements the results of operations of the acquired company prior to the date we acquired it 
any goodwill of an acquisition is amortized over a year period 
we intend to make acquisitions depending upon  among other things  the availability of suitable acquisition opportunities and our ability to finance these transactions 
our success in these acquisitions will depend on our financial strength at the time of acquisition  our ability to hire and retain qualified employees and our ability to identify markets in which we can successfully sell our products 
in addition  once we identify a store that meets our criteria  our success will depend on our ability to sell the store s remaining inventory  to convert the store to a recreation usa store and to attract new customers to the store after the conversion 
our inability to meet our planned growth potential will severely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our growth also depends on same store growth 
over the next years we expect double digit sales growth from same stores 
this projection is based primarily on a large number of the baby boomers reaching their peak earnings and likewise  vacation years 
the us census bureau confirms the expected high growth of the baby boomers segment of the us population 
we launched a national branding strategy in december to consolidate and rebrand the various operating names of our subsidiaries under a new trade name recreation usa 
the new trade name better reflects our corporate identity and solidifies our acquisitions under a single  recognizable brand that will be memorable with customers 
management envisions the establishment of a first class web presence as one of five objectives that comprise the core of our strategic vision 
our presence has continually evolved from its humble beginnings as www 
holidayrv 
com  a business information site that contained price quote access creating prospective leads  all news releases  and all of holiday s filings with the sec 
our first major enhancement was launched in may  as www 
recusa 
com  which upgraded our information site to a business to consumer site introducing the industry s first virtual dealership online 
using recusa 
com  consumers can browse through our new and used inventory  receive a trade in quote  choose financing  insurance  and schedule service for their rv or boat 
purchases through holiday s internet sites can be delivered anywhere through holiday s nationwide locations 
recusa 
com also features an online parts and accessories catalog that allows consumers to purchase rv supplies  camping equipment  houseware  hardware and other accessories online along with special product and service discounts that are only available on the internet 
we believe holiday has one of the most comprehensive e commerce efforts in the industry and expect internet sales to increase significantly as a result of www 
recusa 
com 
results of operations we have summarized for the periods presented  certain selected income statement data as a percentage of total net revenues fiscal year ended october  total revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense income from operations interest expense  net gain loss on the sale of fixed assets income tax provision benefit net income loss number of stores at end of period results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal sales and service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to revenue from the newly acquired dealerships in fiscal of the increase  million  or  was from newly acquired county line and little valley dealerships 
in spite of the negative impact of higher interest rates  increasing fuel prices and a declining stock market on customer traffic starting in the first quarter of fiscal  we were able to increase comparable store stores owned both periods sales by  or million 
we continue to respond to these market conditions with a concentrated focus on aggressive promotions  improved product mix  improved stocking levels  and improved service 
on a pro forma comparable basis all stores for the comparable periods sale and service revenue decreased by approximately  or 
we expect revenue to increase significantly in fiscal  primarily due to our expansion 
we expect our some store sales to fluctuate from the impact of changes in competition within each market we operate  movement in interest rates  general market conditions in the areas in which our stores are located  and our acquisition of new dealerships in the same general market of our existing dealerships 
those risk factors set forth below 
coming off a record setting  rv industry analysts predicted that sales would increase to percent during  yet industry shipments for the first months of the year show the entire sector was down about percent 
motorhomes  which led sales growth during  declined nearly percent 
higher interest rates  increasing fuel prices and a declining stock market dampened consumer confidence in although we expect our existing stores to have sales growth and to remain profitable  we expect most of our sales growth to come from newly added store locations and may not be able to continue to grow or purchase new store locations at a sufficiently rapid pace or on terms and conditions favorable to us 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in  primarily due to gross profit from the newly acquired dealerships in fiscal gross margin decreased to from  primarily as a result of our decision to sell inventory at a lower cost in order to remain competitive 
this decrease was offset by increased margins in parts and services  which increased to from 
this was the result of our strategy to become the rv industry s first national brand 
on a pro forma comparable basis all stores for comparable periods  total gross profit decreased by million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to million in sg a for the newly acquired dealerships 
approximately million of the increase was due to expenses associated with building an infrastructure for our current and future expansion  acquisition related expenses and improving shareholder communications 
expenses to promote the new trade name recreation usa and the relocation of two dealerships also impacted sg a 
we expect the infrastructure building and the acquisition related types of expense to continue but these expenses will have a significantly lower impact in the future on total sg a as revenue from acquisitions increases and the integration of acquired businesses are completed 
in fiscal there was a loss from operations of  this was million less than the million income from operations earned in fiscal operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to from 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased inventory levels  resulting from acquired dealerships  accounting for approximately of the total increase 
higher interest rates on floor plan balances  accounted for of the increase  was for interest on acquisition related debt  and was for mortgage interest 
the federal and state income tax benefit rate was in fiscal compared to a tax rate of in fiscal the combined benefit rate varies from the statutory rate due to increased non deductible expenses for tax  primarily goodwill 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for components of the income taxes and the reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the federal statutory rates 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal sales and service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to a increase in the average selling price of new vehicles 
we experienced a continued trend from fiscal as a result of which we focused on increasing the sale of higher priced motorhomes and boats  targeting diesel motorhomes having greater potential higher dollar gross profits 
we believe the diesel market will continue to grow and offer opportunity to increase revenue 
on a same store basis  without the atlanta dealership  which sold in december  sales and service revenue increased 
parts and service revenue  without atlanta  was the same 
cost of sales and service as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased to from 
this decline was primarily due to the amount of gross profit contributed by parts and service to our total gross profit  which typically have a gross profit of and  and an increase in the gross profit contributed by agency commissions  new and used sales  which typically  in the aggregate  have a gross profit of to 
agency commissions and gross profit from the sale of new and used vehicles and boats  in the aggregate  represented of our total gross profit  compared to in the prior year 
agency commissions  alone  represented of our total gross profit compared to in the prior year 
in both years  agency commissions and gross profit from the sale of new and used vehicles and boats  in the aggregate  represent the majority of our gross profit 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal on a same store basis  sg a increased primarily due to increased selling expenses related to increased revenue and personnel expense increase 
as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased to from 
income from operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest income increased to thousand in fiscal from thousand in fiscal interest expense decreased to million from million  due to fees received in connection with the floor plan arrangement in fiscal  not received in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  income before income taxes increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the combined federal and state effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal income tax rates varied from statutory rates due to state income taxes 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  net income increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal basic and diluted earnings per share were cents in fiscal compared to cents in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for our strategic acquisitions  and to a lesser degree to support operations  including non floored inventory for resale and slower sales period liquidity 
these cash needs have historically been financed with cash on hand or with occasional borrowings from deorge capital management  a company controlled by one of our board members 
changes in our new inventory and partial changes in used inventory are financed by floor plan credit facilities 
cash flows from operations 
during the year ended october   our cash flows continued to increase reflecting the activities of the county line acquisition and the little valley acquisition 
however  net cash of  was used by operating activities in fiscal  compared to positive cash flows from operations of million in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in operating income 
increases in inventories of million were primarily financed by increased floor plan contracts of million 
cash flows from investing 
investing activities used a net of million cash  million to purchase dealerships  and million for purchase of property  plant and equipment  primarily for building the relocated spartanburg  sc dealership 
the sale and leaseback of the bakersfield dealership facility provided million cash 
capital expenditures for property and equipment  not including amounts for business acquisitions  are expected to be approximately  in fiscal cash flows from financing 
financing activities provided net cash of  financing sources were million from a real property mortgage on the new spartanburg dealership and million of notes payable 
cash was used to retire million in notes payable 
net use of cash from all activities was million  which reduced cash and cash equivalents to million from million the prior year 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million from million the prior year  primarily due to cash used for acquisitions in fiscal principal long term commitments 
holiday s principal long term commitments  as of october   consist of operating leases and notes payable  including million in convertible notes payable due to former owners of acquired businesses 
holiday s growth strategies are dependent upon obtaining adequate financing for the purchase of rv and marine dealerships 
we are currently evaluating various sources of capital  its cost  and its ultimate effect on our capitalization 
holiday had  available under floor plan lines of credit for financing new and used inventories as of october  we are currently renegotiating our floor plan agreements with our lenders see note of the financial statements 
we believe we can obtain additional debt financing at reasonable cost for our expansion 
two of the dealership properties that we own are not mortgaged 
we are currently considering mortgage financing  or a sale leaseback arrangement  from which the proceeds could be used for expansion of operations or acquisitions 
we intend to continue the use of common stock as currency for acquisitions  either by initial payment or by issuing debt convertible to common stock  as one form of partial payment for acquisitions 
during the next months it may be necessary to issue additional common stock  additional debt convertible to common stock  or preferred stock that could be converted to common stock  to fund our expansion 
our inability to obtain adequate financing  at reasonable cost  would prevent us from meeting our planned growth and potentially will severely impact our business operating results and financial condition 
inflation 
we believe that increases in the cost of new vehicles and boats that may result from increases in cost of products purchased from our manufacturers can be offset by higher resale prices for used retail vehicles and boats as well as higher retail prices for new vehicles and boats  although there may be a lag in our ability to pass such increases on to our customers 
historically  increases in operating costs are passed on to the consumer when the market allows 
we believe that our business has not been significantly affected by inflation  despite increased chassis and manufacturer conversion costs experienced 
however  significant increases in interest rates may materially and adversely affect purchases of rvs generally and our results of operations and prospects 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities sfas no 
which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas no 
 as extended by sfas no 
and amended by sfas no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  historically  holiday has not entered into derivatives contracts to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  holiday does not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on its financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements of all public registrants 
the provisions of sab are effective for transactions beginning in holiday s fiscal year holiday does not expect the adoption of sab to have a material effect on holiday s financial statements 
we are affected by general economic conditions and our sales are interest rate sensitive our sales are affected by general economic conditions  including employment rates  prevailing interest rates  inflation  and other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income generally 
weakness in the economy and volatility or declines in the stock market could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the majority of our customers purchasing vehicles and boats finance their purchase 
increases in consumer interest rates could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell vehicles and boats 
furthermore  a general increase in commercial interest rates would increase the rates paid by us on our floor plan contracts  thereby adversely effecting holiday s operating income 
we depend on strong sales in our second fiscal quarter our business  and the recreational vehicle industry in general  is very seasonal 
our strongest sales period begins in january  because many recreation vehicle shows are held in that month 
strong sales demand continues from february through the summer months 
of our average annual net sales over the last three years  approximately occurred in the quarter ending april with the exception of our store locations in florida  our sales are generally much lower in the quarter ending january because of the difference in sales in the warm spring and summer months versus the cold fall and winter months  if our sales in the months of february through july are significantly lower than we expect  we may not earn profits or we may lose money and have a net loss 
this experience may materially and adversely affected us 
our growth depends primarily on our ability to acquire new stores we intend to grow rapidly  primarily through the acquisition of recreation vehicle dealerships 
our growth strategy involves significant risks 
we expect our comparable store sales to fluctuate from the impact of i changes in competition within each market we operate  ii the movement in interest rates  iii the general market conditions in the areas in which our stores are located  and iv when we acquire new dealerships in the same general market of our existing dealerships 
although we expect our existing stores to have sales growth and to remain profitable  we expect most of our sales growth to come from newly added store locations and we may not be able to continue to grow or purchase new store locations at a sufficiently rapid pace or on terms and conditions favorable to us 
we intend to make acquisitions depending upon  among other things  the availability of suitable acquisition opportunities and our ability to finance these transactions 
our success in these acquisitions will depend on our financial strength at the time of acquisition  our ability to hire and retain qualified employees and our ability to identify markets in which we can successfully sell our products 
in addition  once we identify a store that meets our criteria  our success will depend on our ability to sell the store s remaining inventory  to convert the store to a recreation usa store and to attract new customers to the store after the conversion 
our inability to meet our planned growth potential will severely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success will depend on how well we manage our growth we have very recently begun a period of rapid growth and  consequently  we have spent much time and effort in acquiring new stores 
although we believe that our systems  procedures and controls are adequate to support our growth  we cannot assure that this is the case and we believe that as we integrate our first acquisitions  we will need to make changes to these systems  procedures and controls 
in addition  our growth will impose substantial added responsibilities on our existing senior management including the need to identify recruit and integrate new senior level managers 
management may not be able to oversee the growth efficiently or to implement effectively our growth and operating strategies 
our inability to manage our growth would result in a significant and severe financial impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely on several key manufacturers for almost all of our inventory purchases our success depends  to a significant extent  on continued relationships with two major manufacturers from which we purchase approximately of our new products 
cancellation or modification of the dealer agreements with these two manufacturers could have material adverse effect on our revenue 
however  the loss of all the brands sold by these major manufacturers is highly unlikely 
dealer representation decisions for manufacturer brands are made at the manufacturer s plants on a brand by brand basis  rather than centrally at each respective manufacturers corporate headquarters 
we currently purchase over brands of rvs and boats from over manufacturers 
we may not be able to respond effectively to the significant competition we face we operate in very competitive conditions 
we must compete generally with other businesses trying to sell discretionary consumer products and also face intense competition from other recreation vehicle dealers for customers  quality products  store locations and rv show space 
we rely heavily on rv shows to generate sales 
if we are limited in or prevented from participating in rv shows in our markets or in markets we are targeting  this limited participation could have a negative effect on us 
within our industry  our main competitors are single and multiple location rv dealers 
we compete with other dealers based on the quality of available products  the price and value of the products and customer service 
to a lesser extent  we also compete with national specialty rv stores  catalog retailers  sporting good stores and mass merchants  especially with respect to parts and accessories 
we face significant competition in the markets where we currently operate and in the markets we plan to enter 
we believe that the trend in the rv industry is for manufacturers to include more features as standard equipment on rvs and for other dealers to offer packages comparable to our packages 
some of our competitors  especially those that sell rv accessories  are large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions we have had and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our growth strategy may require us to secure significant additional capital 
our future capital requirements will depend upon the size  timing and the structure of future acquisitions and our working capital 
any borrowings to finance future operations  asset purchases or acquisitions could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results  a downturn in economic conditions or increases in interest rates on portions of debt that have variable interest rates 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet debt service requirements  we could be required to sell additional equity securities  refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements 
in addition  our credit arrangements generally contain financial and operational covenants and other restrictions with which we must comply 
adequate financing may not be available if and when we meet it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
our failure to achieve required financial and other covenants or to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and prospectus 
we may issue additional securities in connection with acquisitions that may dilute our current shareholders and impact our earnings per share if we choose to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part through the issuance of common stock or debt instruments convertible into our common stock  our existing shareholders could experience dilution and our earnings per share could also be impacted by the issuance of additional shares of capital stock in connection with those acquisitions 
achieving our growth strategy is subject to obtaining adequate financing holiday s growth strategies are dependent upon obtaining adequate financing for the purchase of recreation vehicle and marine dealerships 
financing must be obtained for floor plan of new and used vehicles  purchase or purchase and lease back of real properties for dealerships operations  acquisition of common stock from selling shareholders  working capital  and other capital needs 
our inability to obtain adequate financing  at reasonable cost  would prevent us from meeting our planned growth and potentially will severely impact our business operating results and financial condition 
much of our income is from financing  insurance and extended service contracts  which is dependent on third party lenders and insurance companies we receive a substantial part of our gross profit from the fees we receive from banks and other lending companies 
if our customers desire to borrow money to finance the purchase of their rv  we help the customers obtain the financing by referring them to certain banks that have offered to provide financing for rv purchases 
the bank or other lending company pays a fee to us for each loan that they are able to provide as a result of our referral 
when we sell rvs we generally also offer our customers the opportunity to purchase i service contract that provide additional warranty coverage on their rv or some of its parts after the manufacturer s original warranty expires  and ii various types of insurance policies that will provide money to pay a customer s rv loan if the customer dies or is physically disabled 
we sell these products as a broker for unrelated companies that specialize in these type of issues  and we are paid a fee for each product that we sell 
agency commission fees run approximately of our total gross profit 
this arrangement carries several potential risks 
for example  the lenders we arrange financing through may decide to lend to our customers directly rather than to work through us 
if the customer goes directly to the bank to apply for a loan to purchase their rv we would not receive a fee for referral 
second  the lenders we currently refer customers to may change the criteria or terms they use to make loan decisions  which could reduce the number of customers that we can refer 
also  our customers may use the internet or other electronic methods to find financing alternatives 
if either of these events occur  we would lose a significant portion of our income and profit 
if our products are defective  we could be sued because we sell  service and custom package rvs  motors and other rv equipment  we may be exposed to lawsuits for personal injury and property damage if any of our products are defective and cause personal injuries or property damage 
manufacturers that we purchase product from generally maintain product and general liability insurance and we carry third party product liability insurance 
we have avoided any significant liability for these risks in the past 
however  if a situation arises in which a claim is not covered under our insurance policy or is covered under our policy but exceeds the policy limits  it could have a significant and material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our stock price may be volatile the price of our common stock may be highly volatile for several reasons 
first  a limited number of shares of our stock are owned by the public 
this may affect trading patterns which generally occur when a greater number of shares are traded 
second  the quarterly variations in our operating results  as discussed above  may result in the increase or decrease of our stock price 
third  independent parties may release information regarding pending legislation  analysts estimates or general economic or market conditions that effect the price of our stock 
also  our stock price may be affected by the demand and the market performance of small capitalization stocks 
any of these situations may have a significant effect on the price of our common stock or our ability to raise additional equity 
our operations are widespread and our services will depend on effective and centralized management we depend on all of our revenue and most of our income from satellite retail sales and service centers 
these centers are geographically widespread throughout the continental us making it difficult for our top management to have a presence in all the centers on a regular basis 
as a result  we are highly dependent upon each center s management for the on going operation of each respective center 
turnover of managerial personnel at any center usually has an adverse effect on the sales and profitability of the center 
turnover of managerial personnel at several of our centers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
our sales are dependent on fuel pricing and availability our business is automotive in nature and as such is dependent upon the availability of fuel 
a decrease in the availability of gasoline and our inability to convert our vehicles to alternative fuels could have a material adverse effect on our business 
historically  increases in the price of gasoline have not had a material impact on our business  as long as there was no concurrent decline in availability 
however  future significant increases in the price of gasoline or decreases in availability would have a material effect on our business 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation  supervision  and licensing under various federal  state  and local statutes  ordinances  and regulations while we believe that we maintain all requisite licenses and permits and are in compliance with all applicable federal  state  and local regulations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits 
the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the adoption of more stringent statutes and regulations  changes in the interpretation of existing statutes and regulations  or our entrance into jurisdictions with more stringent regulatory requirements could curtail some of our operations  deny us the opportunity to operate in certain locations  or restrict products or services offered by us 
various federal  state  and local regulatory agencies  including the occupational safety and health administration  the united states environmental protection agency  and similar federal and local agencies  have jurisdiction over the operation of our dealerships  repair facilities  and other operations with respect to matters such as consumer protection  workers safety  and laws regarding protection of the environment  including air  water  and soil 
as with vehicle dealerships generally  and parts and service operations in particular  our business involves the use  handling  storage  and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes  including environmentally sensitive materials  such as motor oil  waste motor oil and filters  transmission fluid  antifreeze  freon  waste paint and lacquer thinner  batteries  solvents  lubricants  degreasing agents  gasoline  and diesel fuels  and other chemicals 
accordingly  we are subject to regulation by federal  state  and local authorities establishing requirements for the use  management  handling  and disposal of these materials and health and environmental quality standards  and related liability thereto  and providing penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws  ordinances  and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling  or disposal 
noncompliance with or changes to these requirements could adversely affect our business 
we do not believe we have any material environmental liabilities or that compliance with environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations will  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on us 
however  soil contamination has been known to exist at certain properties owned or leased by us 
we have also been required and may in the future be required to remedy soil contamination  or remove aboveground and underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances or wastes 
we monitor soil and groundwater as required by applicable state and federal guidelines 
in addition  it has been our practice and will be our practice to have the shareholders of the acquired dealers indemnify us for specific environmental issues identified on environmental site assessments performed by us as part of the acquisitions 
our customers and potential customers are subject to federal  state and local statutes  ordinances and regulations regarding the ownership of recreation vehicles and boats 
the adoption of more stringent statutes  ordinances and regulations effecting the consumer ownership of recreation vehicles or boats  could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange 
to date  our revenue from operations has exclusively been denominated in united states dollars 
the rv and boat products that we have sold to date have been priced in united states dollars and all of our sales in the fiscal years and  and  have been denominated in united states dollars 
in the future  we may acquire rv or boat products that are priced in currencies other than the united states dollar and we may expand sales operations outside the united states 
if either of these events occurs  fluctuations in the values of the respective currencies in which we purchase or sell could adversely affect us 
due to the constantly changing currency exposures and the volatility of currency exchange rates  there can be no assurance that we will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
in the event we conduct transactions in currencies other than the united states dollar  we intend to carefully evaluate our currency management policies 
if we deem it appropriate  we may consider hedging a portion of any currency exposure in the future 
interest rates 
we invest our surplus cash in financial instruments consisting principally of overnight bank repurchase agreements with fixed rates of interest 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
our overnight repurchase investments have some of the characteristics of floating rate securities  since the rates are subject to change each business day 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
if in the future we invest in longer term fixed rate investments  we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we face interest rate risk exposure on our floor plan financing since the rates on such debt fluctuates with prevailing market rates and this debt is substantial in relation to our asset base 
we may also face interest rate risk exposure in connection with debt issued in connection with our acquisition strategy
