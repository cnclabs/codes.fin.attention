introduction this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding bankshares and tfb 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of the financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere herein 
management is not aware of any market or institutional trends  events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of bankshares or tfb 
also  management is not aware of any current recommendations by its regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations 
tfb s internal sources of such liquidity are deposits  loan repayments and securities available for sale 
tfb s primary external source of liquidity is advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of atlanta 
overview the reported results of bankshares are dependent on a variety of factors  including the general interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the industry  governmental policies and regulations and conditions in the markets for financial assets 
net interest income is the largest component of net income  and consists of the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is primarily affected by the volume  interest rates and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  net income of million in was a increase from net income of million 
earnings per share eps on a fully diluted basis were in compared to in profitability as measured by return on average equity increased from in to in certain expenses associated with a misappropriation of cash reduced and earnings by  and  net of tax  respectively 
on february   the bank was first advised by its accountants as to the possible misappropriation of cash in the approximate amount of  the bank immediately reported the loss to its insurance carrier and began an aggressive investigation of the misappropriation 
the  loss  or  net of taxes  was recorded in based on the ongoing investigation  an additional loss of  or  net of taxes  was recorded in on january   the bank recovered  or  net of taxes  from its insurance carrier for these losses 
this recovery will be recorded as income in the first quarter of the year ended december  subject to further results of the ongoing investigation  additional recoveries  if any  would be recorded as income in the year received 
net interest income 
total interest income grew million or to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of loan growth 
average loan balances increased from million in to million in the average yield on loans remained a relatively stable in compared with in together  this resulted in a million increase in interest income from loans for the year compared with year partially offsetting the increase in interest income from loans was the million decline in investment income due to the decline in average investment assets 
average investment balances decreased million from million in to million in  primarily due to investment maturity proceeds being reinvested into loans rather than other investments 
the tax equivalent average yield on investments declined slightly from in to in the use of maturing investments to fund new loan growth  as exhibited in  is projected to significantly lessen in loan growth will be primarily funded by deposit growth and or fhlb of atlanta advances 
average deposit balances grew million  primarily in demand deposits and time certificates of deposit 
the average rate on interest bearing deposits increased from in to in due to the growth in costlier time certificates of deposit  which more than offset the decline in now  money market account  and savings account rates 
net interest income for increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was accomplished through a rise in total average earning assets from million in to million in  as well as the reduction in average interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in the percentage of average earning assets to total assets decreased slightly in to from 
the bank s net interest margin increased from in to in future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income will remain relatively stable as interest earning assets increase  but the net interest margin may decrease in due to the growth in time deposits and or fhlb of atlanta advances as the funding source for loan growth  rather than maturing investment proceeds 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  for and  for the amount of the provision for loan loss for and was based upon management s continual evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which encompasses the overall risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  trends in tfb s delinquent and non performing loans  estimated values of collateral  and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers 
there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods as conditions dictate 
non interest income 
total other income increased by  or from million for to million for other income is primarily derived from non interest fee income  which consists primarily of fiduciary fees  service charges  and other fee income 
in  the increase stemmed from a  increase in other service charges  commissions and fees  and a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
these increases were partially offset by a  loss on sales of securities in one major factor in the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was management s focus on reducing the level of waivers on not sufficient fund nsf service charges 
during approximately of nsf were waived compared with approximately in  which in itself increased non interest income  non interest expense 
total other operating expenses increased  or in from the primary component of the increase was an increase in salaries and employees benefits of  or  primarily due to the increase in full time equivalent personnel from approximately at year end to at year end  as well as normal annual salary increases 
in addition  other operating expenses increased  or  primarily due to investigation related expenses as result of the misappropriation of cash  as well as an increase in management consulting fees in connection with tfb s strategic and succession planning processes 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effective tax rates were for and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to tfb s investment in tax exempt securities 
the following table presents a quarterly summary of earnings for the last two years 
in  quarterly income increased in the first three quarters and declined during the fourth quarter 
the reduction in fourth quarter earnings was due primarily to the aforementioned non recurring expenses associated with a misappropriation of cash

there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
non interest income 
total other income increased by  or from million for to million for other income is primarily derived from non interest fee income  which consists primarily of fiduciary fees  service charges  and other fee income 
in  the increase stemmed from an  increase in other service charges  commissions and fees  a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a  increase in trust department income 
these increases were partially offset by  decrease in gains on sales of securities and other operating income in non interest expense 
total other operating expenses increased million or in from the primary components of the increase were an increase in salaries and employees benefits of  partially due to the staffing of the manassas branch opened in  and a  non recurring miscellaneous non loan charge resulting from a misappropriation of cash 
also  net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increased by  during income taxes 
income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effective tax rates were for and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to tfb s investment in tax exempt securities 
comparison of december  and december  financial condition total assets were million at december   an increase of or million from million at december  balance sheet categories reflecting significant changes included investment securities  total loans  deposits  and federal home loan bank advances 
each of these categories is discussed below 
investment securities 
total investment securities were million at december   reflecting a decrease of million from million at december  the fund proceeds resulting from the decrease were primarily reinvested into loans 
at december   the investment securities portfolio was segregated into available for sale of million and held to maturity of million 
the valuation allowance for the available for sale portfolio had an unrealized loss of  at december  compared to  at december  effective january   tfb adopted sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and transferred securities with a book value of  and a market value of  to the available for sale category 
loans 
the total net loan balance after allowance for loan losses was million at december   which represents an increase of million or from million as of december  the majority of this increase was reflected in the loans secured by family residential real estate  which increased million from to in addition  loans secured by nonresidential real estate and consumer installment loans increased million and million  respectively  over the same time period 
the majority of consumer installment loans were comprised of automobile loans 
tfb s loans are made primarily to customers located within its local trade area 
deposits 
for the year ended december   total deposits grew million or when compared with total deposits one year earlier 
the growth in deposits was in noninterest bearing demand deposits that increased by million and time deposits that increased million 
now accounts were relatively stable year to year  while money market accounts and savings deposits declined million and million  respectively 
fhlb advances 
amounts borrowed from the fhlb of atlanta decreased from million or of earning assets at december  to million or of earning assets at december  the decreased borrowings from the fhlb were a result of strong deposit growth 
the term structure of the advances borrowed was years with a year call option in asset quality non performing loans  in most cases  consist of loans that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans that are days or more past due  as well as loans that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the estimated value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
non accrual loans totaled approximately  or 
of total loans at december   as compared to  or 
of total loans at december  non performing loans as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses were and at december  and  respectively 
loans past due days and accruing interest totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
at december   approximately  of the  consisted of two loans  both secured by real estate 
no loss is anticipated on either loan 
there are no loans other than those disclosed above as either non performing or impaired where known information about the borrower caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with the contractual repayment obligations 
there are also no other interest bearing assets that would be subject to disclosure as either non performing or impaired if such interest bearing assets were loans 
there are no concentrations of loans to borrowers engaged in similar activities that exceed of total loans of which management is aware 
capital resources and liquidity shareholders equity totaled million at december  compared with million at december  the relative stability in the amount of equity reflects management s desire to increase shareholders return on equity by managing the growth in equity 
during the first quarter of  the company initiated a dutch auction self tender offer to buy back shares directly from shareholders 
as a result of this action  bankshares bought back  shares  as adjusted for the two for one stock split  or of shares outstanding on december   for million 
exclusive of the dutch auction  bankshares initiated an open market buyback program in  through which it has bought back an additional  shares at a cost of million in   shares at a cost of million in  and  shares at a cost of million in the securities portfolio valuation account decreased its unrealized loss after tax to  at december  compared to an unrealized loss of  at december  banking regulations have established minimum capital requirements for financial institutions  including risk based capital ratios and leveraged ratios 
as of december   the appropriate regulatory authorities have categorized bankshares and tfb as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the primary sources of funds are deposits  repayment of loans  maturities of investments  funds provided from operations and advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
tfb uses its sources of funds to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity  and to meet operating expenses 
management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the desirable level based in part on tfb s commitments to make loans and management s assessment of tfb s ability to generate funds 
cash and amounts due from depository institutions and federal funds sold totaled million at december  these assets provide the primary source of liquidity for tfb 
in addition  management has designated a substantial portion of the investment portfolio  approximately million as available for sale  and has an available line of credit with the fhlb of atlanta with a borrowing limit of approximately million at december  to provide additional sources of liquidity 
at december   million of the fhlb of atlanta line of credit was in use

bankshares adopted fasb no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
this statement has been amended by fasb no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
fasb no 
 as amended  requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
fasb no 
 as amended also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
bankshares considers all consumer installment loans and residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to impairment under fasb no 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that tfb will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not be impaired if it is in the process of collection or there is an insignificant shortfall in payment 
an insignificant delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally do not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgement the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under fasb no 
charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible  as is the case for all loans 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless when such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest income on other non accrual loans is recognized only to the extent of interest payments received 
total loans on the balance sheet are comprised of the following classifications as of december      and loan portfolio in thousands december  loans secured by real estate construction and land development      secured by farmland    secured by family residential      nonfarm  nonresidential loans      commercial and industrial loans except those secured by real estate      agricultural loans loans to individuals except those secured by real estate      all other loans      total loans      less unearned discount total loans  net      the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the bank s non accrual  restructured and past due loans  as well as foreclosed assets  for the periods indicated non performing assets and loans contractually past due in thousands years ended december  nonaccrual loans restructured loans other real estate owned total non performing assets  loans past due days accruing interest allowance for loan losses to total loans at period end non performing assets to period end loans and other real estate owned potential problem loans at december   management is not aware of any significant problem loans not included in table 
summary of loan loss experience analysis of loan loss experience 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgement  is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change in the near term 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are recorded as the provision for loan losses on bankshares statements of earnings  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions

capital bankshares and tfb are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on bankshares financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  bankshares and tfb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
bankshares and tfb s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require bankshares and tfb to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined in the regulations  and of tier i capital to average assets as defined in the regulations 
management believes  as of december  that bankshares and tfb meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
bankshares and tfb exceeded their regulatory capital ratios  as set forth in the following table risk based capital ratios in thousands december  tier capital shareholders equity   tier capital allowable allowance for loan losses   total capital   risk weighted assets   risk based capital ratios tier to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of bankshares and tfb are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in market interest rates 
tfb is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  tfb is not subject to any of the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
tfb uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity under varying market rate assumptions 
tfb monitors exposure to gradual changes in rates of up to basis points up or down over a rolling month period 
tfb s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from gradual changes in interest rates of basis points over months is and  respectively 
management has maintained a risk position well within these guideline levels during the following tables present tfb s market value changes in equity under various rate scenarios as of december  and market risk percentage market minus current dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value federal funds sold   securities   loans receivable    total rate sensitive assets    other assets   total assets    demand deposits    rate bearing deposits    borrowed funds    other liabilities   total liabilities    present value equity    total liabilities and equity    plus market percentage dollars in thousands pts value change change federal funds sold  securities  loans receivable   total rate sensitive assets   other assets  total assets   demand deposits   rate bearing deposits   borrowed funds   other liabilities  total liabilities   present value equity   total liabilities and equity   percentage market minus current dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value federal funds sold   securities   loans receivable    total rate sensitive assets    other assets   total assets    rate sensitive deposits    borrowed funds    other liabilities   total liabilities    present value equity    total liabilities and equity    plus market percantage dollars in thousands pts value change change federal funds sold  securities  loans receivable   total rate sensitive assets   other assets  total assets   rate sensitive deposits   borrowed funds  other liabilities  total liabilities   present value equity   total liabilities and equity
