item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company is a leading provider of carrier class mobile internet infrastructure sofware  enabling personalized  real time access to corporate and internet data 
our business model is built around the licensing of our software platforms for mobile solutions  the geoworks airboss application platform and mobileserver  to wireless carriers and enterprises around the world 
we also provide professional services consulting related to technologies we previously developed  as well as the development of new technologies supporting mobile communications 
our financial performance and financial condition over the last few years have been significantly affected by a number of strategic business decisions 
from our ipo in through early  we were focused on developing and selling wireless operating systems for smart phones and pdas 
our customers were large mobile phone manufacturers who paid us research and development fees to develop software and agreed to pay us royalties based on the number of phones they shipped with our operating system 
this market did not develop as rapidly as expected and we did not generate significant royalty revenue 
in mid  several of the world s largest handset makers including nokia  motorola  ericsson and matsushita  representing over half of our target market  created a joint venture to develop their own mobile operating system 
therefore  in response to the slow growth in the market  the increased competition and the loss of key original equipment manufacturers  oem targets  we shifted our focus to the development of mobile server software for m commerce and information services 
this refocusing of our business strategy affected our reported performance and business model in both fiscal years and in the second quarter of fiscal year  we began changing the nature of our contractual arrangements with customers for engineering services from oem funded research to a professional services consulting basis 
this is reflected in the growth in professional services revenue over the period  and reduced both the risk and reward of being dependent on the collection of product royalty revenues based on potential shipments of our oem customers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we discontinued development of our smart phone operating system and sold the source code  on a non exclusive basis  to one of our major oem customers who we continue to support through a professional service consulting agreement 
in connection with that effort  we significantly reduced headcount and recorded a restructuring charge to bring our ongoing expense levels down sharply to be in line with our business plan to provide mobile software for e commerce and information services 
the shift in revenue from research and development fees to professional services continued in fiscal year  as we grew the volume of engineering consulting services provided to our customers during the year 
consistent with our business plan  most of our research and development and sales and marketing efforts were targeted at our mobile software and services offerings 
in july  we strengthened our product and service offering by acquiring the airboss application platform and the airboss business unit from telcordia  as discussed below 
this acquisition was important to fiscal year revenues  as new mobile software revenues more than offset the expected decline in royalty and source code revenues from legacy products 
in june  we announced a reorganization intended to strengthen our competitive position by accelerating the integration of our two software products  the airboss application platform and mobile server  streamlining our organization and exiting the mobile asp market 
given current market conditions and our available resources  we believe this is the best way to focus our resources on the areas of greatest potential while reducing operating expenses 
as a result of the reorganization  we reduced our workforce by approximately  or employees  and will implement other cost cutting measures that management anticipates will save approximately million in expenses per quarter going forward 
we expect to incur approximately million in restructuring and exit charges in our quarter ending june  acquisition of airboss on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of an established  separate  and unincorporated division of telcordia  considting of of telcordia s airboss business unit  which operated a software and wireless technology services business airboss 
effective as of the closing of the acquisition  we established an office in new jersey to continue the research  development  and deployment of the airboss line of patented mobile communications software products  as well as to service the various third parties whose contractual rights with telcordia were assigned to  and assumed by us as part of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  telcordia terminated the employment of twenty five individuals  who were then immediately hired by us 
results of operations net revenues year ended change year ended change march  march  march  march  net revenues in thousands professional services       software and related services      research and development fees   total net revenues       fiscal year vs 
net revenues 
net revenues in fiscal year increased by  or  in comparison with fiscal year during our continued transition from being a provider of operating systems and related research and development to becoming a provider of wireless data communication services and technologies  professional services revenues have been a primary source for revenue and cash generation 
software and related services primarily include revenues generated from airboss products and services as well as revenues from legacy operating system products 
professional services revenue 
professional services revenue in fiscal year increased by  or  in comparison with fiscal year professional services revenue increased based on both an increased number of hours worked and an increase in our rates as compared to the same periods of the prior year 
we had two primary customers for these services for fiscal year  as compared to three such customers for fiscal year our professional service projects involve consulting related to technology previously developed by us  as well as development of new technologies supporting mobile communications 
software and related services revenue 
software and related services revenue in fiscal year increased  or  in comparison with fiscal year  and now accounts for almost of our total revenue 
this increase is due primarily to the addition of airboss product revenues 
in fiscal year  software and related services revenues included  in one time payments for source code licenses for operating systems 
excluding these one time payments from source code license revenues  software and related services in fiscal year increased  or  in comparison with fiscal year the largest element of software and related services revenue are revenues derived from the sale of our software and the related software customization 
customization contracts also include the potential for additional license fees and maintenance services 
for fiscal year  such software and customization services revenues were approximately  software and customization services revenues included services provided to telcordia  a related party  to support an installation of airboss software for telkom south africa 
in addition  airboss software was customized for cingular interactive  formerly bellsouth wireless data 
no such revenues were recorded for fiscal year since our acquisition of the airboss business unit  airboss products and customers accounted for approximately  of fiscal year revenues 
included in the airboss revenues are  from telcordia  a related party  for fiscal year on march   we announced that we will no longer be providing subcontracted mobile data services to telcordia for telkom south africa tsa as a result of the termination of the contract between telcordia and tsa 
the tsa contract accounted for of fiscal year revenue 
telcordia continues to be an active var for us and our largest stockholder 
we expect airboss product revenues to continue to be a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
the remaining fluctuations in software and related services revenues are due primarily to decreased license fees  and royalty revenues for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year historically  our license and other revenues have been generated primarily by operating system and various application software we developed that are included in smart phones 
as the last of these products containing the geoworks operating systems reach the conclusion of their life cycles  the license revenue from these legacy products has continued to diminish 
in addition  because we have sold operating system source code and terminated a number of license agreements over the past three fiscal years  the number of oem license agreements which could generate future royalty revenues has decreased 
although our legacy license revenues are decreasing  we expect new license and other related revenues will be generated from our mobile software offerings based on the growth of revenues and subscribers of our existing customers such as toshiba and cingular interactive  as well as additional airboss and mobile server software customers 
software and related services revenue also includes license fees generated from our flex ui licensing program 
for fiscal year  the company recorded approximately  in flex ui licensing revenues 
research and development fee revenue 
research and development fee revenue for fiscal year was related to an oem contract with a single customer 
as discussed above  we have adopted a new business model and oem funded research and development contracts are not being actively pursued 
no such revenue was recorded for fiscal year fiscal year vs 
net revenues 
net revenues in fiscal year increased  or  versus net revenues in fiscal year the increase was due to increased professional services revenues and license revenues which more than offset reductions in research and development fees 
the shift in revenue to professional services from research and development fees was consistent with our transition from being a provider of operating systems and related research and development to becoming a provider of wireless data communication services and technologies 
professional services revenue 
professional services revenue increased  or  in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a change in our contractual agreements we provided for engineering services 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we began providing a portion of our non recurring engineering services on a professional services consulting basis rather than as oem funded research and development 
software and related services revenue 
software and related services revenue in fiscal year increased  or  in comparison with fiscal year such revenues included royalty and license fees resulting from the use of our technology in units sold by oem customers as well as sales of our source code and various service revenues 
royalty and license fees increased  or due to royalties received based on increased shipments of units sold by a single oem licensee 
source code revenues  which are included in the royalty and license fees  increased approximately  due to one time non recurring events 
service revenues decreased  or due to a reduction in support fees earned in connection with software licensed to oem customers 
the service fee decrease was consistent with the change in our business model 
research and development fees revenue 
research and development fees revenue decreased  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the revenues recognized in fiscal year resulted from contracts that had been in progress since fiscal year operating expenses cost of professional services 
cost of professional services are those expenses incurred to provide professional services consulting  including compensation  travel  other direct costs  and facilities overhead 
cost of professional services increased  or  to  for fiscal year in comparison with fiscal year the increase for fiscal year was  or to  as compared to fiscal year these increases can be attributed to the increased volumes of professional service activity and revenue as compared with the same periods of the prior fiscal years 
gross margin percentages on professional services revenues were   and during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the gross margin percentages have improved in each year as compared to the prior years because we have charged increased rates for such services and have decreased our average costs due to an improved mix of the engineering resources used to provide these services 
the gross margin recognized on such services is subject to several variables  particularly the average rates charged for these consulting services  the ability of the company to hire and retain engineering personnel at competitive rates  and the utilization rates of those personnel 
cost of software and related services 
cost of software and related services increased  or  to  for fiscal year in comparison with fiscal year the increase in fiscal year is primarily because we began providing software and related customization services after our acquisition of airboss in july costs of these customization services and other related services are recorded based on labor and direct costs and related overhead of these projects 
for fiscal year  cost of customization services was approximately  no such cost was recorded in fiscal year also included in these costs of software and related services are license payments to third parties for software that is incorporated into our software 
such costs decreased  or  to  in fiscal year  in comparison with fiscal year the decrease is due to a reduced proportion of the related revenues being subject to such fees in fiscal year  as compared with fiscal year cost of software and related services increased  or  to  for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year this was primarily due to the increased license payments to third parties for software that was incorporated into our software  as compared to fiscal year to calculate the gross margin on software and related services we have included direct costs of software and related services as well as the amortization of other intangible assets acquired in the airboss acquisition of  for fiscal year such technology related expenses are included in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note acquistion of airboss in the consolidated financial statements 
including this additional amortization expense  the company s gross margin percentages on software and related services was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
excluding these non cash amortization expenses  the gross margin percentages on software and related services was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the gross margins on these revenues are lower in the current fiscal year because of the addition of the revenues and associated costs of providing customization services 
the gross margin recognized on such services is subject to several variables  particularly the mix of products and services provided and the average rates charged for such services 
since we have a limited history in providing such services  the gross margin percentages achieved to date are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  benefits  sales commissions  travel and related facilities overhead expense for our sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expense increased  or  to  during fiscal year  in comparison with fiscal year this increase is due primarily to an increase in personnel and business activity  including business development  as we expanded our efforts to market our new services  particularly the airboss application platform  mobile server  and mobile asp offerings and launched our mobile business alliance program 
sales and marketing headcount grew by  to during fiscal year the increased personnel costs were partially offset by reduced consulting expenses because of the increased internal resources available 
sales and marketing expense increased  or  to  during fiscal year  in comparison to fiscal year this increase was due primarily to increased spending on marketing and advertising programs as well as increased business development activities 
these increased program costs were partially offset by reduced personnel costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers  contract development fees  cost of computer equipment used in software development and related facilities overhead expense 
research and development expense increased by  or to  during fiscal year  in comparison with fiscal year this increase is attributable principally to increased staffing and related costs  including recruiting expenses  as we expanded our research and development efforts 
in particular  the company has focused on software development for the airboss application platform and mobile server 
the research and development staff grew by to over fiscal year in addition  we have utilized consultants and other outside services at a greater level in fiscal year  as compared to the prior year 
research and development expense decreased  or  to  during fiscal year  in comparison to fiscal year this decrease was principally due to reductions in staffing and related costs  including those resulting from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal year such staff and expense reductions were necessary as we stopped doing operating system development and reacted to reduced levels of oem funding 
we also narrowed the scope of our internal research and development to focus on mobile data software and services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include costs for our human resources  finance  legal  general management functions  and the related facilities overhead 
general and administrative expense increased by  or  to  during fiscal year  in comparison to fiscal year this increase was due to increased legal expense as well as the increased personnel costs required to build the administrative infrastructure to support the new business plan and the airboss acquisition 
the general and administrative staff grew to over fiscal year legal fees were  or  of total general and administrative expense  in the fiscal year  primarily due to the openwave formerly phone 
com litigation 
in december  we announced an agreement with openwave systems inc to settle the patent dispute by entering into a royalty free patent cross license and strategic business relationship 
the companies dismissed the patent litigation before the federal district court and the international trade commission 
see further discussion at part item business  and item legal proceedings 
excluding the nonrecurring litigation expenses the general and administrative expenses increase would have been approximately  or  during fiscal year  in comparison with fiscal year general and administrative expense decreased  or  to  during fiscal year in comparison to fiscal year the decrease was due primarily to reduced staffing costs and reduced professional fees due to the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the change in our business focus 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was  for fiscal year this was attributable to the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets resulting from our july acquisition of airboss 
we expect the quarterly amortization expense related to the airboss acquisition to be approximately  per quarter through fiscal year and approximately  per quarter through fiscal year and then the remaining balance will be amortized in the first and second quarters of fiscal year see note acquisition of airboss in the consolidated financial statements 
we review long lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for fiscal year  possible impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  cancellation of the company s largest software and customization contract  declines in the company s stock price  and continued operating losses 
possible impairment of the company s intangible assets were determined based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated 
the estimates resulting from the company s analysis indicated that no impairment was present 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of airboss  we recorded a non cash expense for purchased in process research and development of  in the second quarter of fiscal year the efforts required to complete the acquired in process technology included the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet their design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the acquired in process technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of on the anticipated income streams of the related product revenues 
the discounted cash flow analysis was based on managements forecast of future revenues  cost of revenues  and operating expenses related to the products and technologies purchased from telcordia 
the calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation efforts of airboss prior to the close of the acquisition 
the acquired in process technology was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated 
see note acquisition of airboss in the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense other income 
the proceeds from the sale of  shares  a portion of the company s investment in wink communications  inc wink resulted in other income of  in fiscal year during fiscal year   shares of wink were sold which resulted in other income of  wink completed its initial public offering in august as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  our strategy for liquidating all or some portion of our long term investments will depend on a number of factors 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the levels of cash we use in operations  the desire to diversify our investment risk  and the performance of these investments versus the stock market as a whole 
interest income 
interest income increased by  or  to  during fiscal year  in comparison to fiscal year this increase is attributable primarily to higher cash balances available for short term investment 
in particular  we generated a total of  from the sales of our investment in wink in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year in addition  we have received approximately  from the issuance of our common stock in the past twelve months 
this includes equity proceeds which resulted from a september private placement of  with integral capital partners  a january private placement of  with ivalue creation company  a subsidiary of toshiba corporation  exercises under our employee stock option plans  and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
interest income increased  or  in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year this increase was attributable to the increased balances of cash available for short term investment 
net cash used in operations was significantly reduced due to improved operating performance and we generated  from the sales of wink stock 
in addition  we received  from the issuance of common stock in fiscal year in addition to the  raised in a private placement from amazon 
com in the fourth quarter of fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense was not significant in fiscal years  and  as we have had minimal balances of capital lease and debt outstanding 
as we increase our investment in the assets and infrastructure to support our new business plans  we will consider financing alternatives  which would increase the amount of interest expense incurred in the future 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
income tax expense consists of foreign income tax withholding on foreign source royalties paid us 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately  and for uk income tax purposes of approximately  and for state income tax purposes of approximately  we also had research and development credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  and for state income tax purposes of approximately  utilization of our us net operating loss and research credit carryforwards will be subject to annual limitations based on the change of ownership provisions of the tax reform act of these limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and research credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources the company s total cash and cash equivalents were  at march   compared with  at march  net cash used by operations in the fiscal year was  net cash provided by financing activities for the same period was  as a result of the issuance of common stock and other financing activities 
the balance of our cash usage in fiscal year has been due principally for purchases of equipment 
this level of cash usage is significantly larger than in fiscal year because we have been increasing our investment in research and development and sales and marketing activities in order to execute our business plan 
in addition  legal expenses have been significantly higher in fiscal year although legal expenses are expected to decrease significantly  we expect to incur additional substantial operating losses at least through the current fiscal year  as we increase our investment in the development of wireless data software and services and technologies  including additional sales  marketing and research and development spending 
purchases of property and equipment were   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in capital spending is consistent with the increase in personnel in connection with the execution of our new business plan and the airboss acquisition 
sales of property and equipment were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of property and equipment for fiscal year were done in the normal course of business 
sales of property and equipment for fiscal years and were done to generate cash from excess property due to the restructure 
payments of capital lease and debt obligations were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal year  we entered into a capital lease obligation to finance our new phone system 
capital lease and debt payments for the fiscal years ended march  and were primarily due to regularly scheduled payments of the related liabilities incurred prior to fiscal year in fiscal year  these payments included  to retire the debt outstanding on the property we sold 
during fiscal year  we entered into a series of derivative contracts to hedge against a decline in the value of our investment in wink 
these derivative instruments will mature or expire in november and december of these derivative instruments ensure that the minimum value of the wink investment will be at least  at maturity of the instrument 
the maximum value is limited to  depending on the common share price of wink at maturity or expiration 
proceeds from the issuance of our common stock were approximately   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in fiscal year were generated from a private placement with integral capital partners  a private placement with ivalue creation company  a subsidiary of toshiba corporation  exercises under our employee stock option plans  and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we expect to increase our investment in the development of our wireless data software and services  including additional sales  marketing and research and development spending  and we expect to incur additional operating losses at least through the next fiscal year although we anticipate that our existing cash and capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our operating requirements for fiscal year  we intend to seek additional funding this year to improve operating working capital 
we cannot assure you that such additional funding will be available on acceptable terms
