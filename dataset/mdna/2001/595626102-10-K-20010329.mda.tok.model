item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal periods indicated  selected financial information as a percentage of total sales and revenues 
percentage of sales and revenues fiscal year replacement parts sales company operated shop retail sales royalties and license fees real estate rental revenues other sales and revenues cost of sales and revenues selling  general and administrative expenses operating income before business transformation costs business transformation costs operating income other income  net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income introduction beginning in  the company began to experience declines in earnings and returns on assets and equity 
these trends were due to a combination of slowing growth  increasing operating expenses and an expanding asset base 
the company also began to experience declines in sales and revenues from certain business activities including substantial declines in exhaust sales at both the retail and wholesale level due to the automobile manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems 
these trends  coupled with an expected substantial increase in the company s long term debt as a result of the spin off of midas as an independent company by whitman corporation  led management to conduct an in depth review of current strategies and potential alternative strategies to reverse these trends 
forthcoming from this strategic review and later refinements was a business strategy to devote the company s management and financial resources to becoming a focused and efficient operator of a north american franchise network  licensing midas trademarks outside north america  improving relationships with franchisees  improving the efficiency of the wholesale replacement part distribution system  reducing operating expenses and redeploying assets by franchising company operated shops 
the strategy also called for the introduction of new midas products and services at the retail level to offset the declines in the exhaust business 
in  the company reached an agreement with magneti marelli  spa  a member of the fiat group  to form a strategic alliance to accelerate the development of the midas system in europe and south america 
midas management concluded that magneti marelli had the financial and human resources to accelerate the development of the midas business in europe and south america at a much faster pace than the company 
midas management also concluded that the proceeds from a transaction with magneti marelli could provide the company with additional financial resources which would enable the company to accelerate the execution of its strategic plan 
accordingly  midas sold its interests in europe and south america to magneti marelli for million in october  and entered into a licensing agreement for the midas trademarks and know how as a part of the transaction 
in  the company concluded the disposition of all but one of its north american company operated shops 
a total of shops were either refranchised or closed  with the company realizing gross proceeds of approximately million 
in december  the company acquired nine shops from a franchisee bringing the north american company operated shop count up to ten 
the company may from time to time acquire additional north american shops from franchisees as they become available on an opportunistic basis 
in  the company completed the sale of its australian operations  which consisted of a network of franchised and company operated shops 
this business transformation process resulted in business transformation costs of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal amount included million related to the disposition of company operated shops  million of asset write downs to recognize impairments  million related to changes to the us franchise advertising and return programs  and million in severance and other costs 
the business transformation expense of million included million in franchisee incentive payments  million related to the disposition of company operated shops  million to relocate the corporate office  million to consolidate the north american distribution system and canadian administration function  and million of severance and other costs

midas retail shops fiscal year end franchised and licensed     company operated total     although the total number of shops in operation remained relatively constant over the past years  the number of shops operated by the company declined by shops since the end of fiscal  and the number of shops operating under a franchise or license agreement increased by shops 
this shift in the type of shop operation reflects the sale of shops in europe and australia  and the strategy to refranchise company operated shops in north america 
in may  the company began an aggressive marketing effort to launch the new midas 
this program incorporates an updated shop appearance  expansion of services to include climate control and general maintenance  and new operational standards for building long term relationships with customers 
the approximately  midas shops currently in operation worldwide offer some or all of the following services exhaust  brake  suspension  air conditioning  batteries and a number of other routine maintenance services 
the company s business strategy is to continue to expand these service offerings in the future 
during  midas established parts warehouse  inc pwi  a network of small  quick delivery sites to distribute parts to midas dealers and to customers outside the midas system 
as part of this strategy  the company acquired climate control distribution centers in two separate acquisitions during  and reconfigured many of these sites to add new products 
as of fiscal year end a total of of these sites were open  and an additional were added in the first two months of the business strategy of focusing the company on growing the north american franchisee and distribution network is expected to have a significant impact on the future sources of revenue for the company
