item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
overview jakks was founded to design  develop  produce and market children s toys and related products 
we commenced business operations on july  when we assumed operating control over the toy business of justin products limited justin which consisted primarily of fashion dolls and accessories and electronic products for children 
one of our key strategies has been to grow through the acquisition or licensing of product lines  concepts and characters 
in  we expanded our product lines to include products based on licensed characters and properties  such as world wrestling federation action figures and accessories 
we acquired road champs in february  and have included the results of operations of road champs from february   the effective date of the acquisition 
we acquired the child guidance and remco trademarks in october  both of which contributed to operations nominally in  but contributed more significantly to operations commencing in we acquired berk in june and have included the results of operations of berk since june  in october  we acquired flying colors toys 
the flying colors product lines contributed to operations beginning in the fourth quarter of in july  we acquired pentech international whose products include writing instruments and activity items 
the pentech products contributed nominally to operations beginning in the second quarter of our products currently include action figures and accessories featuring licensed characters  principally from the world wrestling federation  flying colors molded plastic activity sets  compound playsets and lunch boxes  wheels division products  including road champs die cast collectible and toy vehicles and remco toy vehicles and role play toys and accessories  pentech writing instruments and activity products  child guidance infant and pre school electronic toys  toy foam puzzle mats and blocks  activity sets and outdoor products and fashion dolls and related accessories 
in june  we formed a joint venture with thq  a developer  publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment software  and the joint venture licensed the rights from world wrestling federation entertainment to publish world wrestling federation electronic video games on all platforms 
the first games produced under this license were released in november we are entitled to receive a guaranteed preferred return  based on sales of the video games  and thq is entitled to receive the balance of the profits 
in general  we acquire products or product concepts from others or we engage unaffiliated third parties to develop our own products  thus minimizing operating costs 
royalties payable to our developers generally range from to of the wholesale price for each unit of a product sold by us 
we expect that outside inventors will continue to be a source of new products in the future 
we also generate internally new product concepts  for which we pay no royalties 
we contract the manufacture of most of our products to unaffiliated manufacturers located in china 
we sell the finished products on a letter of credit basis or on open account to our customers  who take title to the goods in hong kong 
these methods allow us to reduce certain operating costs and working capital requirements 
a portion of our sales  primarily sales of our road champs  flying colors and pentech products  originate in the united states  so we hold certain inventory in our warehouse and fulfillment facility 
in addition  we hold inventory of other products from time to time in support of promotions or other domestic programs with retailers 
to date  substantially all of our sales have been to domestic customers 
we intend to expand distribution of our products into foreign territories and  accordingly  we have engaged representatives to oversee sales in certain territories  engaged distributors in certain territories  and established direct relationships with retailers in certain territories 
we establish reserves for sales allowances  including promotional allowances and allowances for anticipated defective product returns  at the time of shipment 
the reserves are determined as a percentage of net sales based upon either historical experience or on estimates or programs agreed upon by our customers 
our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of goods produced for us by unaffiliated third party manufacturers  royalties earned by licensors on the sale of these goods and amortization of the tools  dies and molds owned by us that are used in the manufacturing process 
other costs include inbound freight and provisions for obsolescence 
significant factors affecting our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales include the proportion of net sales generated by various products with disparate gross margins  the proportion of net sales made domestically  which typically carry higher gross margins than sales made in hong kong  and the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily amortization of tools  dies and molds  over varying levels of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs directly associated with the selling process  such as sales commissions  advertising and travel expenses  as well as general corporate expenses  goodwill and trademark amortization and product development 
we have recorded goodwill of approximately million and trademarks of approximately million in connection with acquisitions made to date 
goodwill is being amortized over a year period  while trademark acquisition costs are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
results of operation the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations profit from joint venture interest  net other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased million  or to million in from million in the significant growth in net sales was due primarily to the continuing growth in our wheels division  consisting primarily of our road champs die cast toy and collectible vehicles with the launch of the lines of extreme sports products  including our bxs die cast bicycles  fashion and holiday dolls  as well as the addition of flying colors products  which began contributing to operations beginning in the fourth quarter of  and pentech products  which began contributing to operations in august  offset by a decrease in sales of our world wrestling federation wrestling products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
gross profit margin decreased slightly mainly due to an increase in the amortization expense of molds and tools used in the manufacture of our products and royalty expense as a percentage of net sales due to changes in the product mix and the launch of a larger number of products in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and million in  constituting and of net sales  respectively 
the overall significant increase of million in such costs was due to costs incurred in support of the company s development  marketing and distribution of products under its recently acquired flying colors and pentech brands 
the overall dollar increase was due to the significant increase in net sales with its proportionate impact on variable selling costs such as freight and shipping related expenses  sales commissions  cooperative advertising and travel expenses  among others 
we produced television commercials in support of several of our products  including world wrestling federation action figures  flying colors goooze and it s a girl thing in and and we increased our overall media buys in from time to time  we may increase our advertising efforts  including the use of more expensive advertising media  such as television  if we deem it appropriate for particular products 
profit from joint venture 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to earn our preferred return on the sale of world wrestling federation video games by our joint venture with thq with the release of two games  whereas in  four titles were released plus sales continued on releases 
interest  net 
we had significantly higher average cash balances during than in due to the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in december in addition  we assumed certain interest bearing obligations in in conjunction with the pentech acquisition and we had convertible debentures outstanding in other expense net 
other expense in consists mainly of expenses related to the lease termination of certain flying colors facilities and other related shut down costs in addition to costs related to the recall of one of our products in no such expenses were incurred in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes included federal  state and foreign income taxes in and  at effective tax rates of in and in  benefiting from a flat hong kong corporation tax on our income arising in  or derived from  hong kong 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million for which no allowance has been provided since  in the opinion of management  realization of the future benefit is probable 
in making this determination  management considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  as well as the weight and importance given to such evidence 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the significant growth in net sales was due primarily to the continuing growth of the world wrestling federation action figure product line with its expanded product offerings and frequent character releases  as well as to increasing sales in our wheels division  consisting primarily of our road champs die cast toy and collectible vehicles  fashion and holiday dolls and child guidance pre school toys and the addition of berk products  which contributed nominally to operations beginning in the third quarter of and flying colors products  which contributed moderately to operations beginning in the fourth quarter of gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
the increase in the gross profit margin of of net sales was due in part to the changing product mix  which included products  such as world wrestling federation action figures and bxs die cast bicycles  with higher margins than some of our other products  and the amortization expense of molds and tools used in the manufacture of our products  which decreased on a percentage basis due to the fixed nature of these costs 
the higher margin resulting from lower product costs was offset in part by higher royalties 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased nominally as a percentage of net sales due in part to increases in advertising expenses and product development costs of our various products in  which were offset in part by a decrease as a percentage of net sales due to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses in conjunction with the significant increase in net sales 
the overall dollar increase of million was due to the significant increase in net sales with their proportionate impact on variable selling costs  such as freight and shipping related expenses  sales commissions  cooperative advertising and travel expenses in addition to the costs added in connection with our acquisitions of flying colors and berk in we produced television commercials in support of several of our products  including world wrestling federation action figures  in and we may increase our advertising efforts  including the use of more expensive advertising media  such as television  if we deem it appropriate for particular products

quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed operating expenses 
this is consistent with the performance of many companies in the toy industry 
the following table presents our unaudited quarterly results for the years indicated 
the seasonality of our business is reflected in this quarterly presentation

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
operating activities used net cash of million in the year ended december  as compared to having provided million in net cash was provided primarily by net income and non cash charges  such as depreciation  amortization and recognition of compensation expense for options  as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which were offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and the purchase of marketable securities

our financing activities provided net cash of million in the year ended december   consisting primarily of the issuance of our common stock in our public offerings in may and december and the exercises of options and warrants  partially offset by dividends paid to holders of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock 
in  financing activities provided net cash of million  consisting primarily of the issuance of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock partially offset by the repayment of various notes and other debt issued in connection with our acquisitions in in october  we acquired the child guidance and remco trademarks for approximately million 
consideration paid at closing was million in cash plus the issuance of a note payable in the amount of million  which was paid in five quarterly installments ended december  in addition  we incurred legal and accounting fees of approximately  and assumed liabilities of million 
the acquisition was funded in part by the issuance of shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  which were converted into  shares of our common stock in march in april  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock to two investors in a private placement  which were converted into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the use of proceeds was for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in may  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock 
we used substantially all of these proceeds to fund our acquisition of flying colors toys 
in december  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock 
these proceeds  which we invested temporarily in marketable securities and cash equivalents  were applied to our product acquisition  development  working capital and general corporate needs 
in june  we purchased all the outstanding capital stock of berk for approximately million 
berk is a leading producer of educational toy foam puzzle mats and blocks featuring popular licensed characters  including mickey mouse  minnie mouse  winnie the pooh  blue s clues  barney  teletubbies  sesame street  looney tunes and toy story characters  and non licensed activity sets and outdoor products 
on october   we completed the acquisition of the flying colors product line through the purchase of all the outstanding capital stock of flying colors toys  a privately held company based in dexter  michigan 
at or shortly after the closing we paid approximately million for the stock and paid off approximately million of indebtedness 
we also agreed to pay an earn out of up to million in each of the three twelve month periods following the closing if gross profit of flying colors products achieve certain targeted levels during these periods 
the maximum earn out of million was earned in the initial earn out period ended september  one of flying colors toys senior executives and most of its creative design and product development staff have remained with flying colors toys 
flying colors toys principal products include molded plastic activity kits  compound playsets and lunch boxes featuring licensed characters  including rugrats  blue s clues and looney tunes characters 
the kits cover a broad range of products and activities  such as make and paint your own characters  jewelry making  art studios  posters  puzzles and other projects 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of pentech for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  which was paid in cash on the closing of the transaction 
in addition  we paid on the closing million to pay down certain indebtedness of pentech  assumed liabilities of approximately million and incurred estimated legal and other acquisition costs of approximately million 
in december  pentech renewed a three year  revolving credit agreement with bank america business credit  inc now known as bank of america  na babc the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to limitations based upon eligible inventory and accounts receivable as defined in the credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement accrue interest  at pentech s option  at either prime plus or libor plus 
pentech designs  produces and markets licensed pens  markers  pencils  and other writing instruments  craft and activity kits  and related stationery products 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
exchange rates we sell all of our products in us dollars and pay for all of our manufacturing costs in either us or hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of the hong kong office are paid in hong kong dollars 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk as of december   we do not have any outstanding balances on our credit facility  nor do we expect to draw on the facility prior to its termination or expiration  and we have only nominal interest bearing obligations 
accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong 
sales from these operations are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar
