item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of marine support vessels to the oil and gas industry in the us gulf of mexico  the north sea and latin america 
we currently have a total fleet of vessels  including supply vessels  large capacity platform supply vessels  seven large anchor handling  towing and supply vessels  crew boats and nine line handling vessels 
our results of operations are affected primarily by day rates we receive and our fleet utilization 
demand for our vessels is primarily impacted by the level of offshore oil and gas drilling activity  which is primarily influenced by oil and gas prices and drilling budgets of oil and gas companies 
as a result  trends in oil and gas prices can be expected to significantly affect our vessel utilization and day rates 
our day rates and utilization rates are also affected by the size  configuration and capabilities of our fleet 
in the case of supply boats  psvs and ahtss  their deck space and liquid mud and dry bulk cement capacity are important attributes 
in certain markets and for certain customers  horsepower and dynamic positioning systems are also important requirements 
for crew boats  size and speed are important factors 
our day rates and utilization can also be affected by the supply of other vessels available in a given market area with similar configurations and capabilities 
our operating costs primarily are a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
generally  increases or decreases in vessel utilization only affect that portion of our direct operating costs that is incurred when the vessels are active 
as a result  direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization 
in addition to these variable costs  we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and costs for the routine dry dock inspection  maintenance and repair designed to ensure compliance with us coast guard regulations and to maintain required certifications for our vessels 
maintenance and repair expense and marine inspection amortization charges are generally determined by the aggregate number of dry dockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period 
costs incurred for dry dock inspection and regulatory compliance are capitalized and amortized over the period between such dry dockings  typically three to five years 
results of operations the table below sets forth by vessel class  the average day rates and utilization for our vessels and the average number of vessels we owned during the periods indicated

late in the third quarter of  we began to experience increased utilization and day rates for our gulf fleet 
however  the north sea  which was slower to decline in than the gulf  did not experience any improvement until the second quarter of our average supply boat day rates in the gulf increased to  for  compared to  for the average day rates for our fleet of crew boats and line handling vessels increased to  compared to  during utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet increased to in from in utilization for the crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in  due to the dry docking of a majority of our line handling vessels in  and the scheduled dry docking of our swath vessel in brazil 
average day rates for our north sea vessels in  decreased to  compared to  for our average day rate in the north sea  as expressed in us dollars  was impacted by the norwegian kroner  which on average  depreciated by approximately against the us dollar in compared to vessel utilization was for  compared to for as a result of low market day rates and utilization in  we elected to de activate two of our north sea psvs in the third quarter of a third psv was de activated in the fourth quarter of as a result of improving market conditions  we re activated two of these three vessels late in the second quarter of the remaining vessel will be re activated in the first quarter of during  direct vessel operating expenses were essentially unchanged at million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for direct vessel operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in due primarily to the increase in utilization and average vessel day rates for our gulf fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for  up from million for  due to the depreciation  for a full year  of two new vessels we placed into service in mid amortization of marine inspection costs decreased to million for  from million for our general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for principally due to increases in salaries  benefits and professional fees associated with our international operations 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased in due to the increase in utilization and average day rates for our gulf fleet 
interest expense decreased to million during compared million during  due to the reduction of our debt in in  we had income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax benefit of million in our effective income tax rate for was 
the variance from our statutory rate is due to income contributed by our norwegian operations  which is deferred at the norwegian statutory rate of  as it is our intent to reinvest the unremitted earnings and postpone their repatriation indefinitely 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december our revenues for were million  a decrease of  compared to million for this decrease was due to reduced average day rates and utilization for our vessel fleet as a result of reduced demand due to low oil prices 
day rates and utilization for our gulf supply boats and north sea psvs were also impacted by increased competition from newly built vessels entering the market 
late in the third quarter of  we began to experience improvement in utilization and modest increases in day rates for our gulf fleet 
our average supply boat day rates in the gulf decreased to  for  compared to  for average day rates for our fleet of crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to  compared to  during utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet in was also impacted by the de activation or stacking of supply boats 
vessel downtime for dry docking and refurbishment also impacted our supply boat utilization rates for both the and periods 
utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet decreased to in from in utilization for the crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in average day rates for our north sea vessels in  decreased to  compared to  for vessel utilization was for  compared to for as a result of low market day rates and utilization  we elected to de activate two of our north sea psvs in the third quarter of a third psv was de activated in the fourth quarter of during  direct vessel operating expenses decreased to million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for direct vessel operating expenses decreased in compared to due to cost reduction measures that we implemented and the de activation of supply vessels in the gulf and three psv s in the north sea 
the decrease in direct vessel operating expenses was partially offset by additional expenses associated with four new vessels that were placed into service in the last quarter of and the first half of direct vessel operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased due primarily to the decrease in utilization and average vessel day rates for our vessel fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for  up from million for  due to our expanded vessel fleet in the gulf  the north sea and brazil 
amortization of marine inspection costs increased to million for  from million in this was primarily due to the amortization of increased dry docking and marine inspection costs which we incurred in and due to our gulf supply boat upgrade and refurbishment program 
our general and administrative expenses decreased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for  due to cost reduction measures we implemented 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased in due to the decrease in utilization and average day rates for our vessel fleet in interest expense increased to million during compared to million for this increase was due to increased borrowings in which were used to fund our vessel construction and vessel upgrade projects  our working capital requirements and higher average interest rates 
also  in we capitalized million of interest because of our various vessel construction projects compared to million of interest capitalized in in  we had income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax expense of million in our effective income tax rate for was 
the variance from our statutory rate is due to income contributed by our norwegian operations  which is deferred at the norwegian statutory rate of  as it is our intent to reinvest the unremitted earnings and postpone their repatriation indefinitely 
liquidity and capital resources our on going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service debt  fund working capital  acquire  maintain or improve equipment and make other investments 
due to the reduction in industry activity  which occurred in and  and the resulting decreases in day rates and utilization rates  we experienced a net loss during and the first nine months of as a result  our capital requirements during this period were primarily funded through the issuance of additional equity and the incurrence of debt 
during  we completed vessel construction and upgrade projects that we committed to prior to the downturn in industry activity 
in  we also completed our vessel improvement program that consisted of the extensive upgrade and refurbishment of a significant portion of our gulf supply boat fleet 
while this refurbishment program resulted in significant vessel downtime in and in the first half of  we believe that it extended the service lives of many of our vessels and has enabled us to significantly reduce required capital expenditures in and beyond 
capital expenditures for consisted principally of million for miscellaneous vessel improvements and million of deferred marine inspection costs 
in  funds were provided by million in net proceeds from the issuance of common equity in a public offering  million in proceeds from the sale of our liftboats  million in borrowings under our bank credit facilities and million of cash from operations 
during  we repaid million of debt and made capital expenditures totaling million  which included million of deferred marine inspection costs 
other capital expenditures during the period consisted primarily of miscellaneous vessel improvements 
as a result of the sale of our liftboats in may  we recognized a gain  before taxes  of approximately million in the second quarter 
proceeds of the sale were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility 
in june  we exchanged million shares of our common stock for million principal amount  plus accrued interest  of our senior notes due we now have outstanding approximately million in senior notes 
the senior notes are unsecured and are required to be guaranteed by all of our significant subsidiaries 
except in certain circumstances  the senior notes may not be prepaid until august   at which time they may be redeemed  at our option  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to plus accrued and unpaid interest  with the redemption price declining ratably on august of each of the succeeding three years 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
we maintain a bank credit facility that provides a million revolving line of credit that can be used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the bank credit facility is collateralized by a mortgage on substantially all of our vessels other than those located in the north sea and brazil 
amounts borrowed under the bank credit facility mature on july  and bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin that depends on our leverage ratio 
as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or make certain other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
although the bank credit facility does impose some limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us  it expressly permits distributions to us by our significant subsidiaries for scheduled principal and interest payments on the senior notes 
we also maintain a norwegian revolving credit facility in the amount of nok million million 
the commitment amount for this norwegian bank facility reduces by nok million million every six months  with the balance of the commitment to expire in june as of february   we had approximately nok million million of debt outstanding under the facility 
in april  we executed a new loan agreement for an additional norwegian bank facility in the amount of nok million million 
the commitment amount for this additional facility reduces by nok million million every six months beginning june  with the balance of the commitment to expire june as of february   this additional facility was fully drawn 
amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at nibor norwegian interbank offered rate plus a margin 
the weighted average interest rate for our norwegian bank facilities was as of december  our norwegian bank facilities are collateralized by mortgages on certain of our north sea vessels  require that our north sea operating unit maintain certain financial ratios and limit its ability to create liens  or merge or consolidate with other entities 
we believe that cash generated from our operations  together with available borrowings under our bank credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and currently planned capital expenditures 
it was one of our objectives for to improve our financial flexibility by reducing our debt and improving our liquidity 
as part of that objective  we completed the transactions described above during the second quarter of  including our public offering of common stock  the senior note exchange  and the sale of our lift boats 
it is also our objective to position ourselves to pursue acquisitions and opportunities to selectively build new vessels which enhance our capabilities and enable us to enter new market areas 
depending upon the size of such investments  it is likely that we would require additional equity or debt financing 
however  we can give no assurances regarding the availability or terms of any possible transactions and the related debt and equity financing 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures primarily include interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation on derivative and financial instruments as detailed below 
our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as other than trading 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities during trico s exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents estimates of possible changes in fair values  future earnings or cash flows that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and the timing of transactions 
interest rate sensitivity we have entered into a number of variable and fixed rate debt obligations  denominated in both the us dollar and the norwegian kroner norwegian debt payable in norwegian kroner  as detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by monitoring our ratio of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in view of changing market conditions and from time to time altering that ratio by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate bank credit facilities with fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swap agreements  when deemed appropriate 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in variable rate debt 
in we entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage our interest rate exposure on a portion of this debt 
under the terms of the agreement we paid a fixed rate of interest on a notional amount of principal to a counterparty 
the counterparty  in turn  paid us a variable rate of interest on the same notional amount of principal 
the effect of the swap agreements was to limit our interest rate exposure to a fixed percentage on a portion of the related debt obligation 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million  which included our senior notes million  marad bonds million  marad bonds million and the norwegian fixed rate debt million 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million 
the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined using discounted future cash flows based on quoted market prices  where available  on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet dates 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical fair values are based on the same assumptions utilized in computing fair values 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our long term variable rate debt  including accrued interest  was approximately million and million  respectively  which included our us and norwegian bank credit facilities 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates 
fair value was determined as noted above 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates as of december  and would increase annual interest expense by approximately  and  million  respectively 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements  as of december  was based on the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in the pay rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately  a hypothetical increase in the receive rates would decrease interest expense by corresponding amounts 
in february  we sold certain of these interest rate swap agreements for approximately  as of december  we had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity our foreign subsidiaries collect revenues and pay expenses in several different foreign currencies 
we monitor the exchange rate of our foreign currencies and  when deemed appropriate  enter into hedging transactions in order to mitigate the risk from foreign currency fluctuations 
we also manage foreign currency risk by attempting to contract as much foreign revenue as possible in us dollars
