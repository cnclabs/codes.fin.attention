overview vantagemed is a national provider of healthcare information systems and services 
our strategy is to continue to expand our national distribution network through the acquisition of established regional healthcare products and managed care systems companies who will sell and support our new software products and services to an existing and expanding customer base 
we plan to continue to grow our recurring revenues through the migration of current customers from legacy systems to our windows based  internet enabled software products  electronic services and additional acquisitions  while at the same time continuing to expand both our market penetration and product offerings 
of the business combinations we have completed to date  healthcare information systems  inc and northern health solutions  inc 
were accounted for as pooling of interests  and therefore  our financial statements include them as a part of our operations for all periods presented 
we acquired four established regional healthcare information systems companies in  with the first occurring in july  eight companies in and fourteen companies in we have financed our business combinations to date through the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock   shares of series b preferred stock  million in stock options  million in promissory notes and million in cash 
we have made no acquisitions in the year due to the change in the financial market and the uncertainty in the healthcare industry 
we derive revenues from two sources software and systems  and customer support and electronic services 
software and systems revenues result from the licensing of our proprietary software  as well as third party software  computer hardware and supplies 
the third party software is primarily desktop operating systems and standard communication security software 
customer support revenues are derived from software maintenance and customer service  network and computer hardware support  training  data conversion and system installation 
electronic services revenues are generated by electronic insurance claims processing  electronic statement printing and mailing 
our revenues include both recurring and non recurring revenues 
we define recurring revenues as any revenues derived from an existing or acquired customer after the initial installation of the product and revenues generated from sales of new products to existing customers 
we consider our non recurring revenues to be revenues generated on sales to new customers 
we expect the mix of recurring and non recurring revenues to fluctuate because of our acquisition activities and our ability to sell our products to new customers 
over time  we believe that recurring revenues will continue to represent a large portion of our overall revenues 
recurring revenue is not a measurement defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  revenues as defined by gaap 
all companies do not calculate recurring revenues in the same manner or at all 
accordingly  our recurring revenue data may not be comparable with that of other companies 
we have included information concerning recurring revenues because we believe recurring revenues provides useful information regarding our overall revenue mix 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs of software and computer hardware products sold to customers and associated shipping costs  third party costs for supplies and electronic services and salary and benefit costs for employees performing customer support 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the salaries  commissions and benefits of sales staff  executive and administrative personnel costs  advertising and promotional materials costs and travel  communications  facilities  insurance and other administrative expenses 
product development expenses are primarily payroll and related costs to develop new products and enhance existing products 
gross margin data in thousands  except percentage data years ended december  software and systems revenues      cost of revenues      gross margin     gross margin percentage years ended december  customer support and electronic services revenues      cost of revenues     gross margin     gross margin percentage our acquisitions have resulted in significant intangibles and related amortization 
amortization expenses result from the amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets acquired include acquired software  covenants not to compete  customer lists  assembled workforce and goodwill and has averaged of the consideration paid by vantagemed for an acquisition 
acquired software is amortized over two to four years depending on the estimated continued use of the software product acquired 
covenants not to compete are amortized over two to five years  representing the life of such agreements 
customer lists are amortized over two to ten years  representing the estimated future life of customer relationships 
assembled workforce is amortized over one to ten years  depending upon the average length of employment for the employees of those companies we have acquired 
goodwill is amortized over two to ten years depending upon whether the acquisition is established as a new regional office or is consolidated into an existing regional office  and whether or not there is continuing sales of the software purchased in the acquisition 
we periodically review whether there has been a permanent impairment of its long lived assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of  for the impairment of these intangibles 
depreciation expenses also include depreciation of property and equipment over their useful lives  which range from three to seven years 
depreciation expenses are not material to our operating results 
in  we recorded a  net write off of property and equipment 
we have invested approximately million in product development since our inception 
these funds have been primarily invested in our window based  internet enabled products 
the costs have been expensed as incurred 
as of december   we had a post acquisition federal and state net operating loss carry forward benefit of approximately million available to offset future income tax  if any 
these benefits will begin to expire incrementally at various dates ending in since july  we have developed a customer base of over  sites through both acquisitions and internal growth 
we expect our revenues to increase through both internal growth and acquisitions in the future 
we believe that migration of current and acquired customers to our windows based  internet enabled products and the development and marketing of these products to new and existing customers are the keys to our internal growth strategy 
our internal growth model is therefore focused on increasing revenues from software licensing and electronic transaction services  as well as maintaining recurring support revenues 
we recognize revenues from software license fees in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software license fees are recognized as revenues upon delivery of our software products to our customers  as long as evidence of an arrangement exists  the amounts of fees are fixed and determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
computer hardware and supplies revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
revenues from support and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenues from other services are recognized as the services are provided 
our strategy is to acquire companies with technology that will enhance our overall product offerings or companies that build regional market penetration in support of our national distribution channel 
our acquisitions have produced an established distribution channel of regional offices nationwide  provided us access to an existing customer base  new product offerings  and helped us to build our management team 
no acquisitions were completed during the year as we continue to grow  internally and by acquisitions  we expect our operating expenses as a percentage of sales to decrease 
additionally  in june of we implemented a restructuring plan to improve our future operating results

forward looking statements and risk factors special cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements and risk factors this annual report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
investors are cautioned that forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements will prove to be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved 
we are not obligated and expressly disclaim any obligation  to update any forward looking statements 
we are subject to various risk factors  many of which are outside of our control  that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us throughout this report and elsewhere 
all statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to expected future operating results and future financial conditions or statements expressing general optimism about future operating results  are forward looking statements 
the following are the important factors which may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
risks associated with our business we have a limited operating history  a history of losses  expect our expenditures to increase and our losses to continue  and may never achieve profitability we have incurred operating losses since we became a delaware corporation in april we operated and continue to operate with a negative cash flow 
since  we have incurred aggregate net losses of million  of which million was amortization and depreciation  million for the impairment of intangibles and  for the net write off of software purchased for internal use that will no longer be used by the company 
our business strategies may not be successful and we may not be able to achieve or sustain revenue growth or profitability 
if we fail to generate recurring revenues and sustain margins from our customers  we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability our financial success depends upon our ability to increase revenues and sustain margins on our products and services 
to this end  we focus our marketing efforts on upgrading existing systems  providing new software that enables our customers to migrate from legacy to windows based products and to increase the use of electronic services 
if existing customers fail to upgrade or migrate to our newer systems  we may not be able to increase our revenues or obtain profitability in the near term or at all 
if we fail to internet enable our products in a timely fashion we may lose our market opportunity and may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability not all of our windows based products are internet enabled and those that are have not been tested in the market for any substantial length of time 
if we fail to internet enable our products in a timely manner we may lose market share opportunities to competitors and may be unable to increase our revenues or to obtain profitability in the near term or at all 
our restructuring program may not be successful during the second quarter of  we developed and implemented a restructuring program designed to cut company costs and overhead 
the restructuring program has included  among other things  the consolidation of offices  the centralization of our technology centers  staff reductions  and the phasing out of older products and product lines 
there can be no assurances that our restructuring program will result in cost reductions  and the phasing out of products may result in decreased revenues if customers currently using those products do not convert to our new product offerings 
if the expansion of the internet and internet services in the healthcare information technology industry sector continues on a slow pace  we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability from the internet our current systems and anticipated future services are dependent on the use of the internet 
to the extent that the use of the internet does not further penetrate the healthcare information technology industry our ability to realize revenue from internet services will be limited and we may not be able to increase our revenues 
internet or telecommunication service or performance problems or software errors arising after the installation of our software at customer sites could delay market acceptance of our products  lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue and injure our business reputation the performance of our internet enabled products depends upon the efficient operation and timely installation of internet and telephone connections  web browsers and internet service providers and upon the reliability of our software  including third party software incorporated into our software 
the internet and related equipment has experienced periodic operational problems  delays or outages 
in addition  software errors that we fail to detect may result in software performance problems 
the occurrence of any of these problems could cause customers to experience system delays  failures and loss of data 
such problems could lead to customer dissatisfaction  delays in market acceptance of our products  injury to our business reputation and a loss of revenue 
we may become subject to state  federal or foreign taxes that could harm our business we do not currently collect sales or other similar taxes with respect to revenues from consumers in states other than the state of origin 
however  one or more states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out of state companies  similar to ours 
expansion of our operations into such states could subject revenues from these states to state sales taxes under current laws 
in addition  a federal or foreign tax may potentially be imposed on products and services sold over the internet 
a successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or the imposition of federal taxes could seriously harm our business 
on october   the internet tax freedom act was signed into law placing a three year moratorium on new state and local taxes on e commerce in the united states 
the moratorium is expected to end on october  failure to renew this legislation could result in the broad imposition of state and local taxes on e commerce  which could seriously harm our business 
if security and legal liability concerns make customers unwilling to utilize our products and services to transmit medical information over the internet  the demand for our products may diminish and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability potential customers may choose not to utilize our internet enabled software products because of concerns related to the transfer and management of medical information over the internet  including security of the patient medical records being transferred through the internet  errors in the transmission of sensitive medical data over the internet  legal liability for data security failures or transmission errors  and regulatory burdens imposed on healthcare participants who use the internet to transfer confidential patient medical information 
if these concerns prevent potential customers from buying our products and prevent existing customers from upgrading to our internet enabled products  our revenues may not increase and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
breaches of network security could damage our business reputation  lead to customer dissatisfaction  delay market acceptance of our products and result in legal and financial liability and a loss of revenue our electronic transaction services involve the storage and transmission of confidential medical information through our network data centers  over the internet and over dedicated private data lines 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses or similar disruptive problems 
in the event of such a security breach  proprietary and confidential information could be misappropriated or our operations could be interrupted 
these problems could damage our business reputation  lead to customer dissatisfaction and delay market acceptance of our products 
we may also incur legal and financial liability and a loss of revenue as a result of such problems 
concerns related to the infrastructure  speed and reliability of the internet could diminish the demand for and delay market acceptance of our products and could keep us from becoming profitable the internet may fail to become a viable mechanism for the delivery  exchange and management of healthcare information due to a number of factors that are out of our control  including communication speed  reliability of internet service  internet capacity  lack of development of complementary products  such as communication devices  and delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity 
if concerns about such factors prevent potential customers from buying our products and or prevent existing customers from upgrading to our internet enabled products  our internet enabled products may not gain market acceptance  our sales revenues may not increase and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility or decline in the market price of our common stock it is possible that our revenues and operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future years 
if we fail to meet or surpass the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will most likely decline 
we expect that our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including future acquisitions  entry into new healthcare markets  introduction of new products and service offerings and reductions in prices of products by our competitors  delays in development and other quality factors  changes in customer demand for our applications and services  and changes within the healthcare industry 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenues  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have lower revenues  we may not be able to make corresponding reductions in our spending in the short term 
any shortfall in revenues would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly results or the failure to meet analysts expectations could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may lose assets or incur costly litigation to protect our rights we rely primarily on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property 
we currently have no patents and limited registered copyrights covering technology related to our products 
we have no plans to seek such legal protection and  if we do  protection may not be granted 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  a third party or a former employee could copy  reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without authorization or could develop software competitive to ours 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or infringed upon or may infringe upon the rights of others 
consequently  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our confidential information or trade secrets  or to determine the validity or scope of the rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and may not successfully protect our intellectual property 
additionally  we may deem it advisable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to resolve such claims 
such agreements  if required  may not be available on commercially reasonable or desirable terms or at all 
the loss of experienced personnel to competitors or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly interrupt our business operations our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management could negatively impact our ability to carry out our business plan 
we are dependent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate high caliber key personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
there are a limited number of persons with the requisite skills available to serve in these key positions and it may become increasingly difficult to hire such persons 
our business will suffer if we encounter delays in hiring these additional personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
our need for additional financing is uncertain  as is our ability to raise further financing  if required we may need to raise additional funds to respond to business contingencies which may include the need to cover unexpected losses  fund more rapid expansion  fund additional marketing expenditures  enhance our operating infrastructure  respond to competitive pressures  or acquire or develop complementary businesses or necessary technologies 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in the event that such financing requires the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock  you will experience dilution in your ownership 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of opportunities  develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressure could be significantly limited 
delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate takeover  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorizing the board to issue additional preferred stock  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent  creating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three year terms  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we may not be able to realize the benefits of our marketing programs and relationships we have entered into certain marketing agreements intended to increase the awareness of our company in the market and increase future revenues 
the marketing programs may not be successful nor generate the level of interest we expect and we may not be able to realize revenues from these programs 
our financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to dispose of the pending litigations through pre trial motions or by means of a settlement within a range that the company can afford the proceedings are in the early stages  and no prediction can be made as to the outcome 
we believe these actions are without merit and intend to defend ourselves against them vigorously 
risks associated with our acquisition strategy if we fail to identify or negotiate the purchase of complementary acquisition candidates or if competition for such candidates increases  we may be unable to grow our business and expand our distribution network and may fail to achieve or sustain profitability we believe that some of our competitors are undertaking an acquisition strategy similar to ours 
if competition for acquisition targets increases  there may be fewer qualified acquisition candidates available to us and the terms of such acquisitions may become less favorable 
identifying appropriate acquisition candidates  negotiating and consummating an acquisition can be a lengthy and costly process  may divert management s attention and may prevent us from growing our business and expanding our distribution network 
we did not complete any acquisitions for the year ended december  we may not be able to attract and or complete acquisitions in the future due to market conditions  stock price or other factors that may be unfavorable to the company 
problems integrating acquired companies could result in substantial costs  divert the attention of our management team  cause us to lose valuable customers and dilute the value of our acquisitions when we acquire new businesses we must cross train existing and acquired sales personnel  standardize accounting  operational and financial functions of acquired businesses  retain key acquired personnel  and incorporate acquired technology into our existing products 
problems or delays in the integration process may result in substantial costs and the diversion of management s attention from our existing business 
in addition  integration delays could cause us to lose key customers and employees from the acquired company thereby diluting the value of the acquired company 
when we acquire businesses we amortize the acquired intangible assets over the expected future life 
if there is an impairment in the assets due to cash flow  customer base  technology  market value or other indicators of the assets impairment  the remaining book value may need to be written down or we may need to accelerate the remaining useful life of the intangible assets 
technical problems with acquired technology or products could harm our reputation  result in unexpected costs and cause our revenues to decrease although we test and examine an acquisition target s technology and products prior to consummating an acquisition  there may be technical product problems that we fail to discover 
these problems may result in unexpected costs that decrease our revenues and may result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business reputation 
we may become responsible for unknown or unexpected financial or legal liabilities following an acquisition when we purchase a target company  we generally acquire all of that company s liabilities 
although we perform due diligence prior to an acquisition  we may become responsible for a liability that is unknown or greater than anticipated 
any recourse we may have against the former shareholders of an acquired company in such a situation is limited 
such unexpected liabilities could have a significant negative impact on our profits 
if our acquisition activities divert the attention of our management team away from the day to day operations of our company  product development  existing customer relationships and financial performance could suffer as a part of our growth strategy  we intend to acquire additional healthcare information systems companies 
the identification and investigation of appropriate acquisition candidates and the negotiation of acquisitions will require a substantial investment of time on the part of our management team 
these activities could divert time and attention from our product development and from the day to day operations of our company 
these disruptions could in turn harm our relationships with existing customers and have a negative effect on our overall financial performance 
our acquisition strategy may require us to raise additional capital  which could result in dilution we intend to finance future acquisitions by issuing shares of common and or preferred stock for all or a substantial portion of the acquisition price 
in the event that the potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  we may decide to utilize more of our cash resources  if available  in order to maintain our acquisition program 
this may result in the need to raise additional capital 
to the extent we issue shares of our capital stock to finance acquisitions or raise capital  you will experience dilution in your ownership 
risks associated with our industry intense competition in the market for healthcare information systems and services could prevent us from increasing or sustaining revenues and prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability our competitors vary in size  geographic coverage and scope of products and services offered 
the market demand for certain products varies across geographic territories 
industry competitors include organizations such as webmd corporation formally medical manager corporation  infocure corporation  doing business as vitalworks and practiceworks  inc  medic computer systems  inc  idx systems corporation  mckessonhboc  quality systems inc  medscape inc  dentrix dental systems  inc  and national data corporation 
additionally  within each regional market there are several smaller competitors who have developed technologically advanced products offered at lower prices 
finally  with the integration of clinical information systems into practice management systems  several well funded pharmaceutical  medical supply and biotech companies have entered the practice management systems market 
new healthcare information internet companies may become direct competitors in the future 
many of our competitors have greater financial  research and development  technical  marketing and sales resources than we do 
in addition  other entities not currently offering products and services similar to ours may enter our market 
we may not be able to compete successfully with current and or future competitors 
failure to do so could prevent us from increasing or sustaining revenues and achieving profitability 
economic and cost reduction pressures faced by healthcare providers may limit the ability of our customers to buy our products and services and could limit our profitability economic and cost reduction pressures may limit the ability of healthcare providers to make expenditures for new software systems or for upgrades to existing software systems 
a reluctance or inability on the part of healthcare providers to make such expenditures could result in fewer sales and could limit our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 
if there is a delay in the release of products and if we fail to respond to the rapidly changing technology that characterizes our market  our products may be rendered obsolete  we may lose our market opportunity and fail to achieve or sustain profitability we can make no assurances that delays in product releases will not occur in the future 
the market for our products is highly competitive and changes rapidly 
therefore  timely development and introduction of new products  features and services to existing customers will significantly impact our future success 
we will be required to meet rapidly changing market demands  respond to market requirements  develop new proprietary solutions  and successfully market new products and enhancements to new customers and our existing customer base 
any failure to comply with regulations governing the confidentiality and integrity of healthcare information could result in severe legal and financial liability  harm our business reputation and result in a significant loss of customers federal regulations under hipaa governing the confidentiality and integrity of healthcare information transmitted electronically are complex and are evolving rapidly 
any failure on our part however to comply with current or future regulations could subject us to severe legal and financial liability 
we may also fail to enter into appropriate hipaa compliance contracts with our customers 
such failures could also result in harm to our business reputation and a significant loss of customers 
future state or federal legislation may impose restrictions on the ability to transmit patient data over the internet without specific patient consent and could diminish the value of our internet enabled software products and services and lower our revenues and profits the confidentiality of patient records is the subject of substantial regulation by state and federal governments 
such regulations may impose restrictions on the ability of third party processors  like us  to transmit certain patient data without specific patient consent 
such restrictions may cause the value of our internet enabled products and services to be diminished  causing our revenues to decrease 
our billing and claims services are subject to federal and state regulation and any non compliance with these regulations could lead to civil  criminal and financial liability the performance of our billing and claims services are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws 
increased scrutiny has been placed on the billing and collection practices of healthcare providers and related entities 
although we believe that we are in compliance with any such regulations that may relate to the provision of our billing and claims services  any non compliance could lead to civil monetary penalties  criminal fines  imprisonment or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs for us and the customer involved in the non compliance 
regulations that restrict the ability to dispense or refill controlled substances through an electronically transmitted prescription could limit the functionality of our internet enabled software products and could diminish the revenue generated from these products the federal drug enforcement agency has promulgated regulations that may prohibit a pharmacy from dispensing and refilling controlled substances through an electronically transmitted prescription 
these regulations may limit the scope of the prescription ordering and refill functions in our current and future internet enabled software products and may diminish the revenues we obtain from the sale of these products 
if our software products are deemed medical devices  we will be subject to additional regulation that could result in criminal  civil and financial liability  increase our costs and delay the marketing of our new or existing products the us food and drug administration has jurisdiction under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act to regulate computer products and software as medical devices if they are intended for use in the diagnosis  cure  mitigation  treatment or prevention of disease in humans 
we believe that our healthcare information systems are not subject to fda regulation 
if  however  the fda determined that our products were subject to regulation  non compliance with applicable requirements could result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  total or partial suspension of production  refusal by the government to approve products  revocation of approval or clearance previously granted and criminal prosecution 
future fda policies  laws or regulations concerning the development or marketing of healthcare information systems may cause our products to be subject to fda regulation  which could increase our costs or delay the marketing of new or existing products 
future regulations enacted by congress or by state governments may adversely impact the healthcare industry in ways that could damage our business opportunities or profitability the healthcare industry is highly regulated and has been the subject of increasing levels of government regulation during the past several years 
we cannot predict with any certainty the types of regulations that might be imposed or the impact that those regulations might have on our business 
the adoption of regulations currently unanticipated by us or by the healthcare industry could impose burdensome requirements or restrictions on our products or on the activities of healthcare providers 
these restrictions could decrease the demand for our products and could prevent us from growing our business and attaining profitability

to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a p or better rated commercial paper and us government agencies 
all investments have been classified as available for sale and  accordingly  are stated at fair value 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized as adjustments to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company s investment portfolio is exposed to market risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on the company s near term financial condition or results of operations 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities
