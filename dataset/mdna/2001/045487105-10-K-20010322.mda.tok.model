item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of associated banc corp the parent company  together with its affiliates and subsidiaries the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
the financial discussion that follows may refer to the impact of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under section business combinations  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the detailed financial discussion focuses on results compared to discussion of results to is predominantly in section compared to performance summary the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the million earned in basic earnings per share for were  a increase over basic earnings per share of 
earnings per diluted share were  a increase over diluted earnings per share of 
return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe for were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for cash dividends paid in increased by to per share over the per share paid in key factors behind these results were taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  million or lower than taxable equivalent interest income increased by million  while interest expense increased million 
the volume of average earning assets increased billion to billion  which exceeded the billion increase in interest bearing liabilities 
although increases in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in product mix  added million to taxable equivalent net interest income  changes in interest rates resulted in a million decrease 
net interest income and net interest margin were also impacted in by the rising interest rate environment  competitive pricing pressures  branch deposit and credit card receivable sales  and funding of stock repurchases 
the federal reserve raised interest rates six times between july and december  producing an average federal funds rate for that was basis points bp higher than the average for the net interest margin was for  a bp decline from for  the net result of the bp decrease in interest rate spread  offset by a bp improvement in the net free funds contribution 
rates on interest bearing liabilities in were bp higher than last year  while the yield on earning assets increased bp  bringing the interest rate spread down by bp 
total loans were billion at december   an increase of million or over december   predominantly in commercial loans 
excluding the sale of million of credit card loan receivables in  total loans were higher at year end than a year earlier 
total deposits were billion at december   million higher than december   despite the sale of six illinois branch offices in with deposits totaling million 
the growth was predominantly in brokered cds 
asset quality remained relatively strong 
the provision for loan losses pfll increased to million compared to million in net charge offs ncos decreased million  primarily due to fewer ncos on credit cards between the years  given the sale of credit card receivables in april ncos were of average loans compared to in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans was and at december  and  respectively 
nonperforming loans were million  representing of total loans at year end  compared to million or of total loans last year 
noninterest income was million for  million or higher than net gains on the sales of assets and investment securities totaled million in compared to net gains of million in key sales in included a million gain on the sale of the credit card receivables  the million net premium on the sales of deposits of six branches  and million net losses on the sale of investment securities 
excluding these asset and security sales  noninterest income was million  or million higher than with the exception of mortgage banking  which was impacted by a year over year slowdown in secondary mortgage production  all other noninterest income categories collectively increased million or in compared to noninterest expense was million  up million or over however  expenses were reduced by two large items totaling million  namely the reversal of mortgage servicing rights msr valuation allowance and a reduction in profit sharing expense 
not including these items  noninterest expense was relatively unchanged up million or  despite adding million of incremental expenses in from the purchase acquisitions 
excluding the acquisitions  as well as the two items noted above  noninterest expense was million lower than income tax expense decreased to million  down million from the effective tax rate in was compared to for  due to the tax benefits of additional municipal securities  real estate investment trusts  bank owned life insurance  and tax valuation allowance adjustments 
business combinations there were no completed or pending business combination transactions during during  the corporation acquired million in assets through three acquisition transactions 
all were accounted for under the purchase method  and therefore the financial position and results of operations of each entity were included in the consolidated financial statements as of the consummation date of each transaction 
the corporation s business combination activity is further summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share repurchase activity related to the acquisitions is described under the section capital 
income statement analysis net interest income net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets eas  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings  used to fund those and other assets or activities 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of eas and interest bearing liabilities ibls 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates which factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  and repricing frequencies 
net interest income in the consolidated statements of income which excludes the taxable equivalent adjustment on tax exempt assets was million  compared to million last year 
the taxable equivalent adjustments the adjustments to bring tax exempt interest to a level that would yield the same after tax income had that income been subject to taxation  using a tax rate of million for and million for  resulted in fully taxable equivalent fte net interest income of million and million  respectively 
the million increase in the taxable equivalent adjustment between years was in line with the growth in average municipal securities balances 
the impact of carrying more tax exempt assets in is reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a reduction to income tax expense between the years 
fte net interest income was million for  a decrease of million or from the acquisitions  net of the cost to fund them  contributed approximately million more net interest income in than in for compared to  the decrease in fte net interest income was due to the combination of a number of factors  including a rising interest rate environment  an inverted yield curve during the year  funding of stock repurchases  greater average bank owned life insurance boli balances  the sale of branch deposits and credit card receivables  and continued competitive pressures for both loan and deposit products 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on eas and the rate paid for ibls that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average eas 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support eas 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on an fte basis 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are discussed further on an fte basis 
table provides average balances of eas and ibls  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on an fte basis for the three years ended december  tables through present additional information to facilitate the review and discussion of fte net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin 
as indicated in tables and  increases in volume and changes in the mix of both eas and ibls added million to fte net interest income  whereas changes in the rates resulted in a million decline  for a net decrease of million 
the net interest margin for was  compared to in for  the yield on eas rose basis points  increasing interest earned by million with loans accounting for million of the increase  while the cost of ibls increased bp  raising interest expense by million with interest bearing deposits  principally brokered cds  accounting for million  for a net decline of million in fte net interest income 
the decline in net interest margin was unfavorably impacted by tighter credit spreads in increasingly competitive markets and by increased reliance of funding loan growth with market rate sensitive liabilities in a rising rate environment  particularly wholesale funding 
in addition  the lower margin reflects the cost of funding the corporation s share repurchases during and funding more boli an asset whose earnings are recorded as fee income  as well as the sales of branch deposits replaced with higher costing wholesale funds and the sale of higher yielding credit card receivables 
while these actions negatively impacted the margin  they supported other corporate objectives  such as capital management  revenue diversity  and streamlining strategies 
in combination  the growth and composition change of eas contributed an additional million to fte net interest income  while the growth and composition of ibls cost an additional million  netting a million increase to fte net interest income 
average eas were billion in  an increase of billion  or  from on average  the acquisitions contributed approximately million to this increase  while the sale of the credit card receivables reduced average eas by approximately million 
loans accounted for the majority of the growth in eas  increasing to of average eas  compared to for average loans were billion in  up million or compared to up excluding the net impact from acquisitions and the sale of credit card receivables 
during  the corporation focused on shifting the composition of its loan portfolio  growing the proportion of commercial loans  which represented of average eas for compared to for for  fte interest income on loans increased million over last year  with million contributed from loan growth and million added from the rate environment impact on loans see table 
the average loan yield for was  up bp over last year 
the loan yield lagged the change in the market rate in part due to repricing frequencies in the portfolio  competitive pricing pressures on new production  the sale of the higher yielding credit card receivables  and other loan mix changes 
the increase seen in investment yields was primarily a result of the rising rate environment 
average ibls were billion in  an increase of billion or from although the corporation has been successful in attracting transactional demand deposit accounts  loan growth outpaced deposit growth  increasing the corporation s reliance on brokered cds and other wholesale funding sources 
the mix of ibls shifted from lower rate deposits which represented of average ibls for compared to for to higher cost wholesale funding 
average interest bearing deposits were billion in  up million or compared to up excluding the net impact from acquisitions and branch deposit sales 
for  interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased million  with million contributed from the growth in volume and million added from the impact of the rate environment 
brokered cds were the predominant driver of the change in interest bearing deposits  up million on average over last year  and costing bp more in than total wholesale funds including all funding sources other than interest bearing deposits were billion on average for  up million or 
total interest bearing deposits cost on average for bp more than last year  while wholesale funding on a combined basis cost bp higher than last year

the change was predominantly due to a decrease in the market value of assets under management  a function of the declines in the stock and bond markets during compared to  and competitive market conditions 
trust assets under management totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
service charges on deposits were million  million higher than due to mid year rate increases and initiatives to reduce the volume of service charges waived 
mortgage banking income consists of servicing fees  the gain or loss on sale of mortgage loans to the secondary market  and production related revenue origination  underwriting  and escrow waiver fees 
mortgage banking income was million in  a decrease of million or from the decrease was driven primarily by a drop in secondary mortgage loan production in response to the rising interest rate environment in compared to the lower production levels adversely impacted gains on sales of mortgages down million or and volume related fees down million or 
the portfolio of loans serviced for others was relatively unchanged billion at december   down from billion at year end  directly affecting servicing fees which were million  down million or between the years 
credit card and other nondeposit fees were million for  an increase of million or over  with million in increased merchant income  million in all other credit card revenue  and million in other nondeposit charges 
the other credit card revenue was enhanced by the april acquisition agreement and five year agency agreement with citibank usa citi which provide for agent fees and other income on new and existing card business 
retail commission income which includes commissions from insurance and brokerage product sales was million  up million or compared to last year 
the increase was led by higher insurance revenue  particularly from fixed annuities and credit life production 
asset sale gains for were million  including the million gain recognized on the sale of million credit card receivables to citi and the million net premium on the sales of million in deposits from six branches during asset sale gains in of million were primarily attributable to the net premium on deposits of three branches sold in the fourth quarter of boli income was million  up million or over last year  in line with the increase in the average base investment and rate increases effective in the first quarter of other noninterest income was million for  up million from the increase included million recognized in connection with an interim servicing agreement with citi related to the credit card receivable sale  and million in connection with the corporation s mid change in data processing and management information system vendors  both of which compensated for certain additional costs incurred by the corporation 
investment securities losses for were million 
the net losses were primarily from various securities sold and the proceeds either reinvested to mitigate interest rate risk and enhance future yields or to pay down higher cost borrowings 
investment securities gains for were million  primarily due to a million gain on the partial sale of an agency security that carried an other than temporary impairment amount reported in the remaining portion of this security was sold during for a million loss 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense nie for was million  a million or increase over nie 
however  expenses were reduced by two large items totaling million the million reversal of msr valuation allowance and a million reduction in profit sharing expense 
not including these items  nie was relatively unchanged between the years up million or  despite adding approximately million of incremental expenses in from the purchase acquisitions

merit increases between the years were offset by fewer full time equivalent employees ftes and lower temporary contract labor 
average ftes of  during were down or from the  ftes during ftes were reduced throughout the year primarily in operational areas as centralization of processes and other operational related synergies were achieved 
fringe benefits increased million in  primarily the result of a million increase in profit sharing expense 
rising costs of health  dental  and life insurance coverages were nearly offset by reductions in other fringe benefits up million or on a combined basis 
occupancy and equipment expense on a combined basis was million for  essentially unchanged from last year 
data processing costs increased to million  up  or over last year  attributable to increased costs for software and system enhancements during  partially offset by lower credit card processing costs given the credit card receivables sale in business development and advertising increased to million for  up million compared to  primarily in television advertising for a branding campaign in fdic expense decreased to million  down million  reflecting the net rate reduction in the combined bif and saif effective for on a minimally changed deposit base 
amortization of msrs includes the amortization of the msr asset and increases or decreases to the valuation allowance associated with the msr asset 
amortization of msrs increased by million between and  predominantly driven by the recovery of an million valuation adjustment during see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible amortization was million  up due to a full year of amortization during on the intangibles added from the purchase acquisitions 
legal and professional fees were down  compared to last year  primarily due to yk consulting costs not recurring in other expense was million for  down million compared to  most directly attributable to lower loan expenses down million and in line with lower mortgage loan production in and lower credit card expenses following the sale of the credit card receivables in april 
income taxes income tax expense for was million  down million from income tax expense of million 
the corporation s effective tax rate income tax expense divided by income before taxes was in compared to in this decrease was attributable to the tax benefits of increased municipal securities average balances of municipal securities were higher than  increased boli income  real estate investment trusts  and tax valuation allowance adjustments 
balance sheet analysis loans total loans were billion at december   an increase of million or over december   predominantly in commercial loans

loans of this type are in a broad range of industries 
the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations 
within the commercial  financial  and agricultural classification at december   loans to finance agricultural production totaled million or of total loans 
real estate construction loans grew million or to million  representing of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to million or at the end of loans in this classification are primarily short term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate  such as multi family or other commercial development projects 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the corporation  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made in the corporation s tri state market in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances 
commercial real estate includes loans secured by farmland  multifamily properties  and nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties 
commercial real estate totaled billion at december   up million or over last year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed above for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multi family properties  community purpose properties  and similar properties 
loans are primarily made to borrowers in wisconsin  illinois  and minnesota 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in known markets and businesses  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
residential mortgage loans totaled billion at the end of and loans in this classification include residential real estate  which consists of conventional home mortgages  home equity lines  and second mortgages 
residential real estate loans generally limit the maximum loan to of collateral value 
residential real estate loans were billion at december   down million or compared to last year  principally due to lower production as a result of a higher rate environment in compared to and strong price competition 
home equity lines grew by million  or  to million in  in response to promotional efforts in table loan maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity maturity december  within year years after years total in thousands commercial  financial  and agricultural     real estate construction     total     fixed rate     floating or adjustable rate     total     percent based upon scheduled principal repayments

consumer loans to individuals totaled million at december   down million or compared to  with million of retail credit card receivables sold in april installment loans include short term installment loans  direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans which are primarily business oriented since the april sale  student loans  and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers  and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions on such loans 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
factors that are critical to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   no concentrations existed in the corporation s portfolio in excess of of total loans 
allowance for loan losses the investment and loan portfolios are the corporation s primary interest earning assets 
while the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit exposure to the corporation  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  thorough review of potential borrowers  and on going review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  further ensures appropriate management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses afll was million  compared to million at december  the million increase was the net result of million provision for loan losses  offset by million of ncos and a million decrease related to the sale of credit card receivables in the second quarter of as of december   the afll to total loans was and covered of nonperforming loans  compared to and  respectively  at december  tables and provide additional information regarding activity in the afll and table provides additional information regarding nonperforming loans

ratio of afll to total loans at end of period the afll represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the afll is based on management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other factors which could affect potential credit losses 
in general  the change in the afll is a function of a number of factors  including but not limited to changes in the loan portfolio see table  ncos see table  and nonperforming loans see table 
first  total loan growth from year end to was up or when factoring in the million of credit card receivables sold during 
the growth was strongest in the commercial portfolio particularly commercial real estate  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  and construction loans  which grew million or to represent of total loans at year end compared to last year end 
this segment of the loan portfolio carries greater inherent credit risk described under section loans 
while ncos for have decreased million to million  the decline is due to having sold the credit card receivables and thus  no longer incurring related charge offs 
excluding ncos on credit cards  ncos would be relatively unchanged between and finally  nonperforming loans to total loans grew to for compared to last year 
the allocation of the corporation s afll for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology applied by the corporation  designed to assess the adequacy of the afll  focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  and historical losses on each portfolio category 
because each of the criteria used is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management continues to target and maintain the afll equal to the allocation methodology plus an unallocated portion  as determined by economic conditions on the corporation s borrowers 
for both and  estimation methods and assumptions included consideration of year issues on significant customers 
management allocates the afll for credit losses by pools of risk 
the business loan commercial real estate  commercial  financial  and agricultural  leases  and real estate construction allocation is based on a quarterly review of individual loans  loan types  and industries 
the retail loan residential mortgage  home equity  and consumer allocation is based on analysis of historical delinquency and charge off statistics and trends 
minimum loss factors used by the corporation for criticized loan categories are consistent with regulatory agency factors 
loss factors for non criticized loan categories are based primarily on historical loan loss experience and peer group statistics 
the mechanism used to address differences between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes review of recent nonperforming loan trends  underwriting trends  and external factors 
the allocation methods used for december  and were generally comparable 
for  the amount allocated to commercial  financial  and agricultural loans increased  representing of the afll  compared to last year 
the increase was a function of changes in the commercial  financial  and agricultural loans category  including a greater amount of these loans in criticized loan categories and for which specific allocations were made for compared to  increased loan balances  growing to represent of total loans at year end versus last year  and more of these loans in nonperforming loan categories at year end versus last year versus  respectively 
for  the amount allocated to consumer loans decreased to represent of the afll versus for this decrease was predominantly a function of the sale of million of credit card receivables in mid for compared to  the allocation for credit card loans was reduced based on delinquencies and charge offs trending below national averages and the maturation of the portfolio  which indicated lower risk of loss  and the allocation factor for commercial real estate loans included in real estate mortgage was increased given the increased risk associated with a rising interest rate environment on this loan category 
management believes the afll to be adequate at december  while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the afll may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the afll 
such agencies may require that changes in the afll be recognized when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
table allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december  in thousands commercial  financial  and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer      lease financing unallocated      total afll      the pfll in was million 
in comparison  the pfll for was million and million in ncos were million or of average loans for  compared to million or of average loans for  and were million or of average loans for the million decrease in ncos was primarily driven by lower charge offs of consumer loans in versus down million as shown in table 
this decline is predominantly due to having sold the retail credit card receivables in and  thus  no longer incurring related charge offs 
excluding ncos on credit cards  ncos would have been relatively unchanged between and loans charged off are subject to continuous review  and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal  accrued interest  and related expenses 
nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is embodied through the ongoing monitoring and reviewing of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
such past due student loans were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible

loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

nonaccrual loans accounted for million of the increase in nonperforming loans 
commercial nonaccrual loans representing approximately of nonaccrual loans at year end versus at year end increased million  predominantly due to the addition of three large commercial credits totaling approximately million

the decision of management to place loans in this category does not necessarily indicate that the corporation expects losses to occur  but that management recognizes that a higher degree of risk is associated with these performing loans 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry  but rather cover a diverse range of businesses

investment securities portfolio the investment securities portfolio is intended to provide the corporation with adequate liquidity  flexibility in asset liability management  and a source of stable income 
investment securities classified as held to maturity htm are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost while investment securities classified as available for sale afs are carried at fair market value

the fair value of mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie mortgage loans for these securities  such as prepayment risk and interest rate changes 
tax exempt securities grew to represent of total securities based on amortized cost  compared to at year end  due to higher comparable yields combined with tax advantages and additional call protection 
the aggregate fair value of total securities was approximately billion of carrying value and billion of carrying value at december  and  respectively 
at december   the corporation s securities portfolio did not contain securities  other than us treasury and federal agencies  of any single issuer that were payable from and secured by the same source of revenue or taxing authority where the aggregate carrying value of such securities exceeded of stockholders equity or million 
the classification of securities as htm or afs is determined at the time of purchase 
beginning in  the corporation began to classify most investment purchases as afs 
this is consistent with the corporation s investment philosophy of maintaining flexibility to manage the investment portfolio  particularly in light of asset liability management strategies  including possible securities sales in response to changes in interest rates or prepayment risk  the need to manage regulatory capital  and other factors

additionally  liquidity is provided from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
during  the four largest subsidiary banks associated bank illinois  national association  associated bank milwaukee  associated bank green bay  national association  and associated bank north established a billion bank note program 
under this program  short term and long term debt may be issued

the parent company s primary funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings with major banks  commercial paper issuance  and proceeds from the issuance of equity 
the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to stockholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries  repurchase common stock  and satisfy other operating requirements 
dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in and represent a primary funding source 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by its subsidiaries and affiliates without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
additionally  the parent company had million of established lines of credit with nonaffiliated banks  of which million was outstanding at december  during  a million commercial paper program was initiated  of which million was outstanding at december  as discussed in item of form k  subsidiary banks are subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s stockholders 
maintaining adequate credit ratings on debt issues is important to liquidity as it affects the ability of the corporation to attract funds from various sources on a cost competitive basis

the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques which measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporation s asset liability committee and approved by the corporation s board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity  as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the corporation s exposure to a bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses two different measurement tools static gap analysis and simulation of earnings 
the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate interest bearing demand deposits  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan products and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within days days days year over year total in thousands earning assets loans  held for sale    investment securities  at amortized cost       loans       other earning assets    total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits       other interest bearing liabilities       total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap    cumulative ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities at december  the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and interest bearing demand deposit accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances is considered to be long term and fairly stable and is therefore included in the over year category 
the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate risk of embedded positions  including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options  within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation is used to create a more complete assessment of interest rate risk 
along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus and basis point parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net income for the next month period is compared to the net income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus basis point parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations for december   projected that net income would decrease by approximately of stable rate net income if rates rose by a basis point shock  and projected that net income would increase by approximately if rates fell by a basis point shock 
at december   the basis point shock up was projected to decrease net income by  and the basis point shock down projected that net income would increase by 
the projected changes for both and were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
according to the earnings simulation model  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate changes decreased during in response to higher rates in the first half of  the corporation s sensitivity was decreased through the use of intermediate term borrowings 
these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors  such as changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation process 
this action could include  but would not be limited to  delaying an increase in deposit rates  extending liabilities  hedging  changing the pricing characteristics of loans  or changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities 
capital stockholders equity at december   increased to million or per share  compared with million or per share at the end of stockholders equity is also described in note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in stockholders equity in was primarily composed of retention of earnings and the exercise of stock options 
offsetting increases to stockholders equity were the payment of cash dividends and the purchase of treasury stock 
additionally  stockholders equity at year end included a million equity component included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains on securities afs  net of the tax effect  predominately due to the impact of the rate environment at the end of on that portfolio

the adequacy of the corporation s capital is regularly reviewed to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
the assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  stability of earnings  changing competitive forces  economic condition in markets served  and strength of management 
as of december  and  the corporation s tier risk based capital ratios  total risk based capital tier and tier ratios  and tier leverage ratios were in excess of regulatory requirements

under this authorization through december   million shares were repurchased and retired at a cost of million 
in october  the bod authorized the repurchase and cancellation of an additional million shares 
the repurchase of shares under this authorization is expected to begin after repurchases under the march authorization are completed 
the repurchase of shares will be based on market opportunities  capital levels  growth prospects  and other investment opportunities

management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence 
management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks  future growth opportunities  industry standards  and regulatory requirements

the yield on earning assets  which are slower to reprice  rose bp to in q the rate on interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand  increased bp to due to more frequent repricing of deposit products  and wholesale funds 
the net result was a bp decline in interest rate spread 
the decline in spread was offset in part by a bp improvement in net free funds contribution
