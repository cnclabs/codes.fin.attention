the company s effective tax rate was in and in this decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in tax exempt interest earned 
as a result of the foregoing  net income remained constant at million in and in liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  financing revenue equipment through cash flow from operations 
the company also obtains tractor capacity by utilizing independent contractors  who provide a tractor and bear all associated operating and financing expenses 
cash and cash equivalents and investments increased to million as of december  from million at december  the company s policy is to purchase only high quality liquid investments 
cash equivalents and investments primarily consist of municipal demand bonds and municipal demand bond funds 
net cash provided by operations was million in  million in  and million in the primary source of funds in was net income of million increased by non cash adjustments  including depreciation and amortization of million 
net investing activities consumed million in and million in  and generated million in the primary use of cash in was million for capital expenditures  including revenue equipment

trade receivables increased to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to a increase in fourth quarter operating revenue 
cash paid for income taxes decreased to million in from million in lower income taxes on a cash basis are primarily due to increased interest income exempt from federal taxes 
insurance accruals increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the company s insurance program for liability  physical damage and cargo damage involves self insurance retention for the first  per claim 
claims in excess of the risk retention are covered by insurance in amounts which management considers adequate 
the company accrues the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of the pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and estimate of future claims development based on historical claim development trends 
if adjustments to previously established accruals are required  such amounts are included in operating expenses 
the company has one customer who accounted for more than of the company s revenue for the year ended december  as disclosed in footnote two to the financial statements  historically a small number of customers generate a substantial percentage of revenue 
in  the company s largest customer generated approximately of operating revenue 
the loss of a major customer could negatively impact the company 
any negative impact would be mitigated by two factors the strong overall financial position of the company no long term debt at december  and million in cash and cash equivalents and the flexibility inherent in having a substantial percentage of fleet miles being generated by independent contractors who provide their own tractors 
based on the company s strong financial position current ratio of and no debt  management foresees no significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary  to continue with growth plans 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality the nature of the company s primary traffic appliances  automotive parts  paper products  retail goods  and packaged foodstuffs causes it to be distributed with relative uniformity throughout the year 
however  earnings have historically been affected adversely during the fourth quarter as a result of reduced shipments by customers during the winter holiday season 
in addition  the company s operating expenses historically have been higher during the winter months due to increased operating costs in colder weather and higher fuel consumption due to increased engine idling

if the derivative does not qualify as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss on the derivative will be recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for special hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative will either be recognized in income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged or be deferred in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings
