based upon our experience  we estimate the average cost of opening a new department store to range from approximately million to million and the cost of opening a new shoe store to range from approximately million to million including leasehold improvements  fixtures  inventory  pre opening expense and other costs 
similar costs for a filene s store are in the million to million range 
preparations for opening a department store generally take between and weeks and preparations for a shoe store or a filene s store generally take to weeks

seasonality our business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail businesses 
historically  the majority of our sales and operating profit have been generated during the back to school and christmas selling seasons 
fiscal year in june  we decided to change our fiscal year to a week year that ends on the saturday nearest to january this change was made to reflect the reporting period common to most retailers 
fiscal contained weeks 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to be approximately due primarily to the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization related to the shonac acquisition 
adoption of accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues statements of financial accounting standards sfas  some of which require implementation by a date falling within or after the close of our fiscal year 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
the company will adopt sfas effective february  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation because of the nature of the estimates required  management believes that the effect of inflation  if any  on the results of operations and financial condition has been minor 
liquidity and capital resources net working capital was million and million at february  and january   respectively 
current ratios at those dates were and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the fiscal year  the transition period and fiscal  respectively 
net loss  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  used million of operating cash flow for the fiscal year this was reduced by million representing a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable 
increases in accounts receivable  deferred income taxes and prepaid expenses and other assets used million 
other changes in working capital assets and liabilities used million 
during the twelve months ended january   net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  provided million of operating cash flow 
this was decreased by million representing an increase in inventories net of a decrease in accounts payable 
other changes in working capital assets and liabilities provided million 
net cash used for investing activities totaled million  million  million and million for fiscal years   transition and fiscal  respectively 
net cash used for capital expenditures was million  million  million and million for fiscal years   transition and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  capital expenditures included million for new stores  million for improvements in existing stores  million for relocation of office  warehousing and operations of our shoe business  million for mis equipment upgrades and new systems 
all other capital expenditures aggregated million 
at february   we had a million amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement  dated as of march  the credit agreement  which expires on march   provides for revolving and overnight loans and issuance of letters of credit 
outstanding advances are secured by a lien on assets and are subject to a monthly borrowing base of eligible inventories and receivables  as defined 
terms of the credit agreement require compliance with certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on dividends  the incurrence of additional debt and financial ratio tests 
additionally  the company has provided an unconditional guarantee of of amounts outstanding on vcm s million revolving line of credit 
at february   million was available under the credit agreement 
borrowings aggregated million  plus million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding and the vcm loan guarantee totaled million 
the credit agreement provides for various borrowing rates  currently equal to basis points over libor 
the libor rate on million has been locked in at a fixed annual rate of through may under a swap agreement 
in addition  the libor rate on million has been locked in at a fixed annual rate of through april under a swap agreement 
to supplement operating cash requirements the company has a million subordinated secured credit facility with ssc 
outstanding advances under the agreement are subordinated to the bank credit facility and are subject to a junior lien on assets securing the bank credit facility 
at february   million was outstanding 
the interest rate and terms of the million facility are generally the same as the credit agreement 
the company entered into a million senior subordinated convertible loan agreement senior facility  dated as of march  the senior facility bears interest at various rates  currently equal to basis points over libor 
the interest rate increases an additional basis points every days after the first anniversary date 
the senior facility is due in september in december  pursuant to terms of the senior facility  ssc purchased the outstanding balance under the same continuing terms 
the terms provide that if prior to march   the balance outstanding thereunder is not repaid from the proceeds of an equity offering or other subordinated debt acceptable to lenders under the credit agreement  then after that date ssc  as the lender  has the right to convert the debt into our common stock at a price equal to of the day average of high and low sales prices reported on the new york stock exchange at the time of conversion 
as of march   the senior facility was not repaid 
we paid ssc a one time fee of basis points  or million  at the initial closing in consideration for entering into a put agreement associated with the senior facility 
although we believe that cash generated by operations  along with the available proceeds from the credit agreement  ssc subordinated secured credit facility and other sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our obligations for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements there is no assurance that we will be able to meet our projections 
further  there is no assurance that extended financing will be available to us in the future if we fail to meet our projections 
our sales results in the first two fiscal months of were below plan  we believe principally as a result of severe weather in many of our markets 
this condition  along with the effect of increased heating and fuel prices affected the retail industry in general 
achievement of expected cash flows from operations and compliance with our credit agreement covenants see note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon a number of factors  including the attainment of sales  gross profit  expense levels  vendor relations  and flow of merchandise that are consistent with our financial projections  particularly for the balance of the spring season 
a recent discussion with a major factor indicated they intend to reduce our future availability of credit and that we need to strengthen our liquidity and increase our credit availability from other sources 
acquisition on march   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  base acquisition corp  completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of filene s basement corp  a massachusetts corporation  and filene s basement inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of filene s basement corp 
pursuant to the closing of the asset purchase agreement  dated february  the purchase price included cash of million paid at closing  million to be paid over a period not to exceed three years   shares of our common stock with an agreed value of million and the assumption of specified liabilities 
the assumed liabilities included the payment of amounts outstanding under filene s debtor in possession financing facility of approximately million and certain trade payable and other obligations which will be paid in the ordinary course 
allocation of the purchase price has been determined based on fair market valuation of the net assets acquired subject to resolution of several outstanding matters 
the acquisition was funded by cash from operations and a portion of the proceeds from the credit agreement 
risk factors and safe harbor statement we caution that any forward looking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of contained in this report  other filings with the securities and exchange commission or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statements decline in demand for our merchandise  the ability to repay the million senior facility through an equity offering or refinancing  our ability to attain our fiscal business plan  expected cash flows from operations  vendor and their factor relations  flow of merchandise  compliance with the credit agreement  our ability to strengthen our liquidity and increase our credit availability  the availability of desirable store locations on suitable terms  changes in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  changes in weather patterns  changes in existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas  paper and printing costs  and the ability to hire and train associates 
historically  our operations have been seasonal  with a disproportionate amount of sales and a majority of net income occurring in the back to school and christmas selling seasons 
as a result of this seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during this period  including adverse weather  the timing and level of markdowns or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at february   direct borrowings aggregated million 
the facility  as amended and restated effective march   permits debt commitments up to million  has a march  maturity date and generally bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus 
we have swap agreements to help manage the exposure to interest rate movements and reduce borrowing costs 
as of february  the interest rate on million has been locked in at a fixed rate of until may and has a fair market value of  after january  the interest rate on an additional million was locked in at a fixed rate of until april at february   we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming an average outstanding principal amount of million subject to variable interest rates 
a increase in libor would result in approximately million of additional interest expense annually
